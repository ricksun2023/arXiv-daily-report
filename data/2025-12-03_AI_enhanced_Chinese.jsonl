Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation.

We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking.

To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks.

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model.

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aLLM-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7531\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6982\u7387\uff08\u03b4\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u03b4> 0\u90fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u9884\u671f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u6709\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u7b97\u3002"}}

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered.

This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bVoxCap\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u5e93\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5019\u9009\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5b50\u5e93\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f53\u7d20 captioning \u65b9\u6cd5 VoxCap\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210 SMILES \u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1ade-novo \u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "VoxCap \u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684 de-novo \u547d\u4e2d\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0cVoxCap \u53ef\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "VoxCap \u80fd\u591f\u641c\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u5e93\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u521d\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u62c9\u8fd1\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdc\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR10\u3001CIFAR100\u3001Caltech-101\u3001Caltech-256\u3001ImageNet\u3001BiasedMNIST\u3001UTKFace\u548cCelebA\u7b498\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38BiasedMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In DocETL, users build pipelines by composing operators described in natural language, also known as semantic operators, with an LLM executing each operator's logic. However, due to complexity in the operator or the data it operates on, LLMs often give inaccurate results. To address this challenge, DocETL introduced rewrite directives, or abstract rules that guide LLM agents in rewriting pipelines by decomposing operators or data. For example, decomposing a single filter(\"is this email sent from an executive and discussing fraud?\") into the conjunction of two separate semantic filters may improve accuracy. However, DocETL only optimizes for accuracy, not cost. How do we optimize for both?\n  We present MOAR (Multi-Objective Agentic Rewrites), a new optimizer for DocETL. To target cost optimization, we introduce two new categories of directives and extend all three existing categories with new ones, bringing the total to over 30 directives -- more than doubling what DocETL originally had. Moreover, since operators can interact with each other unpredictably due to LLM behavior, optimizing operators or sub-pipelines individually can yield suboptimal overall plans. Recognizing this, we design a new global search algorithm that explores rewrites in the context of entire pipelines. Since the space of rewrites is infinite -- pipelines can be rewritten in many ways, and each rewritten pipeline can itself be rewritten -- our algorithm adapts a multi-armed bandit framework to prioritize which pipelines to rewrite.

Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5(MSM)\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684LLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7740\u91cd\u5173\u6ce8\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5(MSM)\u3002", "conclusion": "MSM\u65e8\u5728\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u7528\u4f8b\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems.

However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions.

Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing.

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process.

I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489).

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive.

While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.\n  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.\n  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy.

Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9006\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u8f9b\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e2\u6602\u8d35\u53c8\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0e\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models.

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6d41\u7545\u8fde\u8d2f\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b(HD)\u548c\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1(FV)\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86UniFact\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86FV\u548cHD\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002HD\u548cFV\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u79bb\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6UniFact\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83FV\u548cHD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "(1)\u6ca1\u6709\u54ea\u4e2a\u8303\u5f0f\u662f\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\uff1b(2)HD\u548cFV\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff1b(3)\u96c6\u6210\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00llm\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SubCure\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fae\u5c0f\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5220\u9664\u54ea\u4e9b\u5143\u7ec4\u6216\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9519\u8bef\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6781\u5927\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e0\u679c\u58f0\u660e\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SubCure\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u6570\u4fee\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u5220\u9664\u54ea\u4e9b\u5143\u7ec4\u6216\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53d6\u6d88\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u56e0\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86SubCure\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSubCure\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5220\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u96c6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u6570\u4fee\u590d\u662f\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9632\u6b62\u6e90\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution.

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K.

All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.\n  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).\n  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers.

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u9650\u5236\u5f53\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u9650\u5236\u5f53\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u5f81\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u8eab\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5021\u5bfc\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6709\u610f\u7684\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6539\u9769\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The remaining 43.4% are identified as structurally missing due to legacy enrolment practices rather than stochastic non-response. Forensic analysis (chi-square, logistic regression) shows missingness is highly predictable from entry decade and geography, confirming a structural, historically induced mechanism. The article contributes: (a) a transparent, reproducible normalisation pipeline tailored to higher education; (b) a framework for treating structurally missing information without speculative imputation; and (c) guidance on defining analytically coherent cohorts (full population vs. secondary-school-informed subcohorts) for downstream learning analytics and policy evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u516c\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e3a 1980-2019 \u5e74\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u7eb5\u5411\u5927\u5b66\u7ba1\u7406\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i) N1 CENSAL\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u534f\u8c03\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u4eba\u5458\u5c42\u9762\uff1b(ii) N1b IDENTITY RESOLUTION\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c4\u8303 ID\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1b(iii) N1c GEO \u548c SECONDARY-SCHOOL NORMALISATION\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u8003\u8868\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b66\u6821\u7c7b\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a DATA_MISSING\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86 100% \u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a 56.6% \u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u5269\u4f59\u7684 43.4% \u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8d21\u732e\uff1a(a) \u4e00\u4e2a\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b(b) \u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1b(c) \u5173\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u961f\u5217\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0e\u77e5\u60c5\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5b66\u6821\u5b50\u961f\u5217\uff09\u7684\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLM\u4e0a\u5f88\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574f\u4e86RLM\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6RESP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5220\u9664\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLM\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86RLM\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e5f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u6270\u4e71\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6RESP\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u548cMathQA\u4e0a\uff0cRESP\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572820-30%\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u572840%\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0cRESP\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523081.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728MathQA\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523059.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf66.87%\u548c47%\u3002", "conclusion": "RESP\u5728GSM8K\u548cMathQA\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572820-30%\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002"}}

These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic\" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats.

We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales.

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e60\u5f97\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b0\u8bed\u53e5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5973\u513f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u6210\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8868\u793a\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u5728\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86MODOMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8ba9\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u3002"}}

To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6620\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b83\u652f\u6301\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u663e\u7740\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u56de\u5f52\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002"}}

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\\% of their energy consumption.

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%.

This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%.

This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments.

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions.

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views.

Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience.

To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items.

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors.

A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e2\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u6c60\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 37 \u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 9 \u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5bf9\u6c42\u89e3\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u68c0\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u5224\u65ad\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u6216\u53e6\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u540c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5185\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u5217\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u81ea\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002"}}

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios.

This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer.

Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability.

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Few is a guided self-play framework for AI self-evolution that uses lightweight human oversight to improve model performance.", "motivation": "Unguided self-evolving systems often fail due to concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution.", "method": "R-Few incorporates human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training, using a Challenger-Solver framework with curriculum learning.", "result": "R-Few achieves consistent improvements on math and reasoning benchmarks, with Qwen3-8B-Base improving by +3.0 points on math tasks compared to R-Zero.", "conclusion": "R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics in AI self-evolution."}}

However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e00\u7c7b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u786e\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u6807\u51c6\uff1a1) \u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c2) \u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c3) \u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)].

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Aetheria\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u8bf4\u670d\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u548c\u88c1\u51b3\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u4e8e RAG \u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5 (AIR-Bench) \u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86 Aetheria \u4e0d\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684 AI \u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field.

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "VACoT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728OCR\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03VLM\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "VACoT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bf8\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cVACoT\u8fd8\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684agentic\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u60e9\u7f5a\u5197\u957f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86VACoT\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86AdvOCR\u6765\u7a81\u51fa\u540e\u7f6e\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "VACoT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u8f85\u52a9\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u6765\u81ea\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5171\u60c5\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5171\u60c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5171\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust.

In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups.

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources.

This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.\n  We give a general reduction from sample-based \\emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.\n  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries.

Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features.

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed.

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains.

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL).

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways.

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline.

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684 Transformer \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u6808\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u8be5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66ff\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684 Transformer \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u6808\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u3002"}}

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e03\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u548c\u653e\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u51cf\u8f7b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9GPT\u3001LLaMA\u548cQwen\u7cfb\u5217\u768413\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e86Linear\u3001Karcher Mean\u3001SLERP\u3001NuSLERP\u3001TIES\u3001DELLA\u548cNearswap\u4e03\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08BBQ\u3001BOLD\u548cHONEST\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5bf9SuperGLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dLLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002Linear\u3001SLERP\u548cNearswap\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9002\u5ea6\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u7684SLERP\u662f\u6700\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations.

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology.

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies.

Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \\emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty.

While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences.

However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants.

We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\u0398$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\u03ba> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.\n  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping.

Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem.

However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u754c\u9762\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aGUI Exploration Lab\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5c01\u95ed\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u9762\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "1.  \u6784\u5efaGUI Exploration Lab\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5c4f\u5e55\u3001\u56fe\u6807\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u56fe\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b4. \u5229\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9f13\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c4f\u5e55\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings.

Our second result analyzes \\textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u4e0d\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u8c31\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8c31\u6b8b\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c3e\u90e8\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u62bd\u6837\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6570\u636e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u754c\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u8c31\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8c31\u6b8b\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c3e\u90e8\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents.

Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning.

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LightHCG\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79efVAE\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u533a\u57df\u5185\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u6216\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHSIC\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "LightHCG\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5bf9\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cd\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8693~99%\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982InceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u6216VGG16\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LightHCG\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\\% for both benign and harmful tasks.

Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks.

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%.

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784TabGRU\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eCMLs\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548cBiGRU\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u54e5\u5fb7\u5821\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cTabGRU\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728Torp\u7ad9\u70b9\u548cBarl\u7ad9\u70b9\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.91\u548c0.96\u7684R2\u3002", "conclusion": "TabGRU\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eCML\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOLT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8c31\u57fa\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u826f\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u76f8\u5bf9\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "BOLT\u6846\u67b6\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u4e3b\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u5c42\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u51bb\u7ed3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u4e3a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u6781\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u79e9\u63a7\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684PEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "BOLT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u8c31\u57fa\u5e76\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6839\u6df1\u8482\u56fa\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9785\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u504f\u79bb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u6027\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u671f\u671b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a9\u957f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6839\u6df1\u8482\u56fa\u548c\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bfb\u6c42\u771f\u76f8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9785\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u8fdd\u53cd\u9785\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9785\u5c5e\u6027\u610f\u5473\u7740\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u6027\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u9884\u671f\u503c\u5e94\u7b49\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53ef\u4ee5\u79ef\u6781\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6839\u6df1\u8482\u56fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6839\u6df1\u8482\u56fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u9785\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9785\u5206\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9785\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfb\u6c42\u771f\u76f8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7740\u773c\u4e8e\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8de8\u57df\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\uff08RCB\uff09\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c Huber \u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88 RCB \u7b97\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u6216\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDROCO \u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684 DROCO \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching.

As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86 \u0448\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6 nuScenes\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76 (AV) \u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf (ADAS) \u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9769\u547d\u6027\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u975e\u5e38\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u662f\u5f00\u53d1 AV \u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9 nuScenes \u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55 nuImages \u548c Panoptic nuScenes \u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u8fc4\u4eca\u672a\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e2d\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e86 nuScenes \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u540e\u6765\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5982\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u81f3\u4eca\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f17\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528 nuScenes \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u548c\u975e\u5b98\u65b9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8 nuScenes\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9 nuScenes \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5176\u521b\u5efa\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation.

In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks.

However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\\tilde{\\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\\tilde{\\oo}(\u03b4^{-1}\u03b5^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers.

In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u65ad\u8a00\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6765\u6e90\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u793a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u8fd0\u8425\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8584\u5f31\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u65ad\u8a00\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6765\u6e90\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u793a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a \"majority\" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k.

However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features.

Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models \"know\" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This \"virtue signaling gap\" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric.

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "SchED\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684logits\u8fb9\u9645\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(dLLM)\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(dLLM)\u662f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u7f13\u6162\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSchED\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684logits\u8fb9\u9645\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cSchED\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.8-4.0\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8699.8-100%\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u6570\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cSchED\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5177\u670999.1-100%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8fbe2.34\u500d\u3002\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\uff0cSchED\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SchED\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u4f7fdLLM\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002"}}

However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss.

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales.

We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024.

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models.

One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale.

However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP) \u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u5883\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "MoCoP \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9 GPT-4-Turbo \u548c DeepSeek \u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoCoP \u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7eb5\u5411\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb (rET = -0.81, p < 0.001)\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5173 (rEL \u2248 0)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9053\u5fb7\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0cMoCoP \u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b AI \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory.

Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline.

This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements.

In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u673a\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ece\u6e90\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u60a3\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u673a\u5668\uff08Adapt-TKM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Adapt-TKM\u5728\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94SVM\u6a21\u578b\u5c11\u7ea6100\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "Adapt-TKM\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u3002"}}

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing.

In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference.

To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp).

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks.

Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models.

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg.

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment.

Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy.

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence.
