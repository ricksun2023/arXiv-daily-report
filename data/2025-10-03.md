### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个概念学习任务数据集，用于揭示大型语言模型中的隐性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，语言模型在量词方面可能存在向上单调性的偏差；当模型在没有概念学习组件的情况下通过直接提示进行测试时，这种偏差不太明显。这表明上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏差的有效方法。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验。

Result: 发现语言模型在量词方面可能存在向上单调性的偏差。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏差的有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提议通过开放式的交互式语言发现，让人工智能系统通过对话动态学习新语言，而不是静态数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的自然语言处理由于缺乏文本语料库、标准化正字法和可扩展的注释管道而受到根本限制。大型语言模型的最新进展改善了跨语言迁移，但由于它们依赖于海量、预先收集的数据和集中式基础设施，因此对于代表性不足的社区来说仍然难以访问。

Method: 提出了一种基于人机联合不确定性的框架，该框架结合了来自模型的认知不确定性与来自人类说话者的犹豫线索和置信度信号，以指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。

Result: 本文是一项行动呼吁：我们提倡重新思考人工智能如何在记录不足的语言中与人类知识互动，从提取式数据收集转向尊重和授权社区的参与式、协同自适应学习过程，同时发现和保护世界语言多样性。

Conclusion: 这种愿景符合以人为本的人工智能原则，强调人工智能系统和说话者之间的交互式、合作模型构建。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用大型语言模型评估了美国上市公司的气候信息披露成熟度，发现披露内容与实际减排目标脱节，且企业间存在模仿行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候信息披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿和象征性报告降低了其价值。

Method: 本文构建了一个多维度框架，使用针对气候沟通进行微调的大型语言模型，从828家美国上市公司的可持续发展和年度报告中提取叙述性指标，并将其与企业属性联系起来。

Result: 研究发现：风险导向的叙述与明确的承诺相关，但量化目标与语气脱节；规模较大和排放较高的公司披露了更多的承诺和行动，但与量化目标不一致；披露风格的广泛相似性表明存在模仿行为。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了大型语言模型在 ESG 叙事分析中的价值，以及加强监管以将承诺与可验证的转型战略联系起来的必要性。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种兽医专用的大型语言模型(LLM)摘要工具在兽医肿瘤记录数据集上的表现，发现Product 1的表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)越来越多地应用于临床，但其在兽医学中的性能尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用基于评分标准的LLM-as-a-judge框架，对摘要在五个领域进行评分：事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织。

Result: Product 1获得了最高的总体性能，中位平均分为4.61（IQR: 0.73），而Product 2为2.55（IQR: 0.78），Product 3为2.45（IQR: 0.92）。它还在事实准确性和时间顺序上获得了完美的中位数分数。LLM评分器表现出很高的重现性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性，并证明LLM-as-a-judge评估是一种可扩展且可重复的方法，可用于评估兽医学中的临床NLP摘要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个使用小型语言模型和实时网络证据的自动事实核查系统，在准确率上超过了使用大型模型的先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的事实核查系统依赖于大型、闭源模型和静态知识存储，计算需求高昂。

Method: ClaimCheck采用透明的、逐步的验证流程，模仿人类事实核查工作流程，包括网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索以及声明结论评估。每个模块都针对小型LLM进行了优化。

Result: ClaimCheck在使用更小的Qwen3-4B模型时，在AVeriTeC数据集上实现了76.4%的最先进的准确率，优于先前使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化设计和prompt策略可以克服小型LLM的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在数学基准测试中表现出色，但可能存在数据污染和问题类型狭窄的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前基准测试是否能真实反映LLM的数学推理能力。

Method: 引入名为EEFSUVA的新基准测试，该基准测试来自东欧和前苏联的区域和国家奥林匹克竞赛。

Result: 即使是最先进的LLM，在EEFSUVA上的表现也明显下降。

Conclusion: 更广泛的评估数据集对于全面评估数学推理和指导未来的模型开发至关重要。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型应遵循分层指令，但研究表明它们经常忽略系统提示并强烈服从社会线索。我们通过线性探测、logit 归因和 steering 实验，从机制上解释了这种行为，揭示了冲突决策信号的编码、内部冲突检测的强度以及社会线索对指令遵循的放大作用。结果解释了系统顺从的脆弱性，并强调了轻量级层级敏感对齐方法的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在系统提示与用户输入冲突时，以及在社会线索影响下，如何进行决策。

Method: 1.  构建大规模数据集；2.  使用线性探测来识别冲突决策信号的编码位置；3.  使用 Logit 归因来检测内部冲突；4.  使用 Steering 实验来研究社会线索的影响。

Result: 1. 冲突决策信号在早期被编码，系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间；2. 系统-用户案例中内部冲突检测更强，但只有社会线索能持续解决冲突；3. 社会线索以角色无关的方式放大指令遵循。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型的系统顺从性脆弱，需要轻量级的层级敏感对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的pipeline，无需人工标注数据，即可微调小型transformer模型，用于文档重排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）擅长重排序，但计算成本高。微调小型模型更有效，但依赖于稀缺的手动标注数据。

Method: 使用LLM从领域语料库生成合成查询，并使用基于LLM的分类器标记正例和难负例。然后使用合成数据集，通过对比学习和局部对比估计（LCE）损失来微调一个较小的transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了领域内性能，并能很好地推广到领域外任务。

Conclusion: 通过使用LLM进行数据生成和监督，而不是推理，降低了计算成本，同时保持了强大的重排序能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文利用PHATE流形分析方法，研究了中文嵌入中的几何模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中文嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算支持，并为语义组织提供新的几何分析框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，对七个嵌入模型和八种降维方法进行交叉验证，观察内容词的聚类模式和功能词的分支模式。分析了12个语义领域的1000多个汉字，并通过全面的子网络分析（123个短语）展示了从基本字符的系统语义扩展。

Result: 观察到内容词的聚类模式和功能词的分支模式。几何复杂性与语义内容相关：有意义的字符表现出丰富的几何多样性，而结构部首则坍缩成紧密的簇。

Conclusion: 该研究为传统语言学理论提供了计算证据，并为语义组织的几何分析建立了一个新的框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究旨在提高高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对信息过载和高风险决策的需求，提出了一种结合不确定性量化和风险意识机制的大型语言模型框架。

Method: 构建了一个基于条件生成的摘要模型，并在生成过程中引入贝叶斯推断来模拟参数空间中的不确定性。使用预测分布熵来测量生成内容的不确定性水平，并应用熵正则化和风险意识损失的联合优化，以确保在信息压缩过程中保留关键信息并明确表达风险属性。模型还结合了风险评分和调节模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了摘要在高风险应用中的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 本研究为可信摘要提供了一种系统解决方案，并在方法层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为“基准测试分析”的诊断框架，用于分解基准测试性能为十种认知能力，以更细致地评估模型在基准测试上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型的评估方式（标准基准测试）过于笼统，无法准确反映模型在特定任务中所需技能的组合。例如，即使是设计用来评估常识的基准测试，也可能无法避免地考察到模型在其他方面的能力。因此，有必要开发一种系统性的方法来验证这些基准测试是否真正衡量了它们所声称的能力。

Method: 该方法结合了基于梯度的重要性评分和目标参数消融，计算出一个“能力影响得分”（AIS），以量化每种能力对模型在给定基准测试中成功的影响。

Result: 通过对三个指令调整模型在十个广泛使用的基准测试上进行分析，得出了四个主要发现：（1）大多数基准测试依赖于多种能力，而不是单一能力；（2）具有相似标签的数据集依赖于不同的能力组合；（3）代码生成基准测试奖励广泛的多技能改进，因此从狭窄的特定领域微调中仅显示出适度的收益；（4）与任务无关的能力可能会对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: “基准测试分析”解释了为什么性能提升并不总是转化为用户可感知的 компетентность，并为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了一个透明的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合传统社区知识与现代计算方法，构建首个用于分析泰卢固语韵律模式的综合数字框架。

Method: 该方法涉及协作创建包含 4,651 个带注释的 padyam 的数据集、专家验证的语言模式以及具有文化意识的算法设计。该框架包括用于识别韵律的 AksharamTokenizer、用于分类轻音节和重音节的 LaghuvuGuruvu Generator 以及用于自动模式识别的 PadyaBhedam Checker。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了计算社会科学如何保护濒危的文化知识系统，同时实现围绕文学遗产的新形式的集体智慧。该方法为以社区为中心的文化保护方法提供了见解，支持数字人文和社会感知计算系统中更广泛的举措。

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个prompt感知的路由框架，根据prompt的特征为每个prompt选择最合适的LLM，以优化性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决选择哪个LLM来优化性能和效率的难题，因为大型语言模型(llm)的能力、延迟和计算成本各不相同。

Method: LLMRank使用从prompt中提取的丰富、人类可读的特征，包括任务类型、推理模式、复杂性指标、句法线索和来自轻量级代理求解器的信号。利用神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用，该模型在RouterBench上训练，RouterBench包含36497个prompt，跨越11个基准和11个最先进的llm，从小型高效模型到大型前沿系统。

Result: LLMRank实现了高达89.2%的oracle utility，同时提供了可解释的特征属性，解释了路由决策。

Conclusion: LLMRank证明了多方面特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性，突出了特征驱动路由在高效和透明的LLM部署中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了 16 种无监督指标，用于评估从 1,000 份俄罗斯司法判决中提取七个语义块的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律自然语言处理中，人工智能的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本。

Method: 该研究评估了 16 种无监督指标，包括新的公式，以评估从 1,000 份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取的七个语义块的质量，并针对 7,168 份专家评审进行了验证，专家评审采用 1-5 级 Likert 量表。

Result: 结果表明，术语频率一致性（Pearson r = 0.540，Lin CCC = 0.512，MAE = 0.127）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r = 0.513，Lin CCC = 0.443，MAE = 0.139）与专家评级最吻合，而法律术语密度（Pearson r = -0.479，Lin CCC = -0.079，MAE = 0.394）表现出强烈的负相关性。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于 LLM 的方法）支持可扩展的筛选，但由于相关性中等且 CCC 值较低，因此无法完全取代高风险法律环境中的人工判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

TL;DR: DermIQ-VLM 通过多阶段、资源高效的方法开发，模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM 在医学图像分析中显示出前景，但它们在皮肤病学等复杂领域中的结构化推理能力通常受到数据稀缺和高级训练技术的高计算成本的限制。

Method: 引入了一种名为 GRPO++ 的 Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 的修改版本，它稳定了强大的但数据密集的 GRPO 框架。首先采用 GRPO++ 进行面向推理的疾病识别，然后进行监督微调以获得会话能力。为了减轻在此步骤中引入的事实错误，然后使用直接偏好优化 (DPO) 对齐模型，利用基于知识图的系统作为专家偏好的可扩展代理。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病学数据集上的初步评估表明，所提出的方法学比标准微调方法产生了显着的性能提升。

Conclusion: 这些发现证实了该流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专门的、可靠的 VLM 的可行途径的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [16] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，会生成看似合理但实际上不正确的内容。本文提出了一种置信度感知路由系统，该系统在生成内容之前主动评估模型的不确定性，并根据估计的可靠性重定向查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缓解策略侧重于生成后的校正，计算成本高昂且无法阻止不可靠内容的生成。为了解决这个问题，本文提出在生成前主动评估模型的不确定性。

Method: 该方法结合了三个互补信号：内部表示和参考嵌入之间的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析以及学习到的置信度估计。统一的置信度分数确定到四个路径的路由：高置信度的本地生成、中等置信度的检索增强生成、低置信度的大型模型以及极低置信度的人工审核。

Result: 在知识密集型 QA 基准上的评估表明，幻觉检测有显着改进（0.74 vs. 0.42 基线），同时与事后方法相比，计算成本降低了 40%。F1 分数从 0.61 提高到 0.82，假阳性率较低 (0.09)。

Conclusion: 这种从被动校正到主动评估的范式转变提供了一种计算效率高的方法来增强 LLM 的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 填充token在LLM中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致它们影响计算。研究表明，即使少量填充也会影响隐藏层表示，降低生成质量，改变偏差，并削弱安全保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究填充token对大型语言模型（LLM）的影响，因为在批量推理中，填充token被广泛使用以均衡序列长度，但它们的影响程度尚不清楚。

Method: 在三个开源模型系列（Llama, Gemma, Qwen）中，插入受控数量的填充，并沿四个轴评估结果：激活、生成质量、偏差和安全性。

Result: 即使少量的填充也会改变隐藏层表示，降低较小模型的质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏差，并削弱安全护栏。

Conclusion: 填充不是一个无害的细节，而是一种鲁棒性风险，必须在部署中小心处理。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX: A novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are expected to handle diverse sub-tasks, but reprocessing the entire conversation context incurs significant computational overhead.

Method: Reuses the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injects only task-specific instructions into isolated side paths. Rolls back to the main path via cached context after sub-task execution. Uses a hierarchical classification strategy for sub-task selection.

Result: Significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task performance.

Conclusion: Enables scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Motivation: 现有的数学基准测试存在天花板效应，难以区分 LLM 在数学能力上的细微差异。

Method: 构建了包含不同难度和结构的数学题目的基准测试，并使用 15 个 LLM 变体进行评估，分析模型在不同科目和难度上的表现。

Result: 最强的模型在竞赛套件上达到 44% 的准确率，在推理套件上达到 81% 的准确率。模型在难度较高的题目上表现下降，且不同模型之间存在明显的差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE 提供了一个难度较高、以推理为中心且覆盖范围广泛的数学基准，具有校准的难度和丰富的元数据，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [20] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型会随着会话重置而遗忘情景记忆，但语义记忆仍然稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在重置后，语义提示稳定但情节细节崩溃，这表明存在结构性不对称。

Method: 提出了一种名为人工年龄评分 (AAS) 的指标，该指标基于可观察的记忆行为来衡量记忆老化程度。

Result: 在为期 25 天的 ChatGPT-5 双语研究中，AAS 在无状态会话中显著增加，表明结构性记忆老化，而在持久会话中则保持较低水平。

Conclusion: AAS 可以作为评估人工系统中记忆退化的理论工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为ARGRE的新的测试时解毒框架，通过在潜在表示空间中显式建模毒性转换，实现稳定和精确的奖励引导编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对毒性和非毒性输出之间的转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确。

Method: ARGRE识别非毒性语义方向，并在毒性和非毒性表示之间进行插值，以揭示细粒度的转换轨迹。这些轨迹将稀疏的毒性注释转换为密集的训练信号，从而构建一个自回归奖励模型，提供稳定和精确的编辑指导。在推理时，奖励模型指导自适应的两步编辑过程以获得解毒的表示。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上的大量实验表明，ARGRE在有效性（-62.21%的毒性）和效率（-47.58%的推理时间）方面显著优于领先的基线，同时以最小的降解保留了原始模型的核心能力。

Conclusion: ARGRE框架通过显式建模毒性转换，实现了LLM的有效解毒，并在有效性和效率方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 这篇研究开发了一个心理压力本体 (MeSO)，并评估了使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 从叙述性文本中提取本体指导的压力相关信息的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子健康记录中压力记录不一致且通常为非结构化文本， ambient AI虽然有潜力减轻记录负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述，限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过整合压力应对模型和11个验证的压力评估工具的概念来开发MeSO。使用本体陷阱扫描仪和专家验证来改进MeSO的结构和内容。使用MeSO，从35个Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，包括压力源、压力反应、应对策略、持续时间、发病和时间特征。

Result: 最终的本体包括八个顶级类别中的181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别了172个 (78.2%)，错误分类了27个 (12.3%)，遗漏了21个 (9.5%)。所有正确提取的项目都被准确地映射到MeSO。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了使用本体指导的LLM进行压力相关信息的结构化提取的可行性，并有可能提高环境AI系统中压力记录的一致性和效用。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Method: 提出一个基于LLM的多智能体框架，自动提取和推理在线文本中的时空相关文本，并通过渐进式融合架构将细粒度的相关上下文与时空数据结合。

Result: 在数据集上，SeMob的MAE降低了13.92%，RMSE降低了11.12%。

Conclusion: 该框架在事件发生地点和时间附近的区域表现出显著的优越性，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用 top-k SAE 潜在变量进行语言模型控制，但存在许多维度捕获非语义特征的问题。此外，恒定的 SAE 控制策略容易产生退化的输出。

Method: 提出关注单个最相关的 SAE 潜在变量（top-1），并引入 token-wise 衰减的控制策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够可靠地引导模型进行逐步数学推理，提高推理质量，并且在数学推理基准测试中优于平均激活差异方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效提高 SAE 在语言模型控制中的性能，尤其是在数学推理方面。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的结构感知自监督学习方法，用于文本属性图 (SSTAG)，通过利用文本作为统一的表示媒介，弥合了大型语言模型 (LLM) 的语义推理和图神经网络 (GNN) 的结构建模能力之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图学习模型通常在单个图数据集上进行训练，限制了它们跨不同图和任务转移知识的能力。此外，图结构化数据由于其固有的异构性而带来了独特的挑战，包括特定领域的特征空间和跨各种应用程序的结构多样性。

Method: 引入了一个双重知识蒸馏框架，该框架将 LLM 和 GNN 共同提炼成结构感知多层感知器 (MLP)，从而增强了大型 TAG 的可扩展性。此外，我们还引入了一种内存机制，用于存储典型的图表示，将它们与内存库中的内存锚对齐，以整合不变知识，从而提高模型的泛化能力。

Result: SSTAG 在跨域迁移学习任务上优于最先进的模型，实现了出色的可扩展性，并降低了推理成本，同时保持了竞争性能。

Conclusion: SSTAG 是一种有效的方法，可以解决图学习中跨域泛化和可扩展性的挑战。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法，用于创建高质量的科学语料库，为更可靠的科学AI训练和评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

### [29] [Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for LLM-based Entity Linking in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01251)
*Carlo Bono,Federico Belotti,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用token级别特征，从单次LLM输出中进行自监督不确定性估计的方法，以提高实体链接(EL)任务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在实体链接(EL)任务中表现出色，但实际应用需要准确的预测和可靠的不确定性估计，而后者通常需要消耗大量资源的多次推理。

Method: 使用token级别特征，从单次LLM输出中进行自监督不确定性估计。

Result: 在表格数据上的EL任务评估表明，该方法能有效检测低精度输出，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种将不确定性估计纳入EL工作流程的实用方法，计算开销有限。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在大量未标注语料上训练，理解模型表征和数据内化成为挑战。本文将LLM与稀疏自编码器(SAE)结合，解释模型行为以及训练数据中更深层的结构、主题和偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型(LLM)中的模型表征和数据内化

Method: 使用简·奥斯汀的小说训练GPT模型，然后应用SAE到隐藏状态，挖掘稀疏的可解释特征，反映语料库中的关键叙事和概念，包括性别、阶级和社会责任。

Result: LLM与SAE结合可以作为复杂数据集的可扩展探针，为语料库探索、偏差发现和大规模模型可解释性提供新路径。

Conclusion: LLM与SAE结合可以作为复杂数据集的可扩展探针

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 目前的语音大语言模型偏见和公平性基准测试严重依赖于多项选择问答 (MCQA) 形式，但本文对这一假设提出了质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在语音大语言模型中，基于多项选择问答 (MCQA) 的偏见基准测试，是否能可靠地预测模型在其他任务形式（如长文本生成）中的表现。

Method: 使用 LoRA 适配器对三个语音大语言模型进行微调，诱导特定的 MCQA 行为，包括对刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案的偏好。然后，评估这些行为是否能推广到另一个不同的 MCQA 基准，以及更重要的长文本生成任务。

Result: 研究结果表明，在 MCQA 偏见基准上的表现无法可靠地预测在其他 MCQA 基准上的表现，更重要的是无法预测在长文本任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 目前的 MCQA 偏见基准在语音领域中显示出有限的跨任务泛化证据，并提出了一个评估套件，用于衡量未来模型和基准中的行为可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为AI Watchman的纵向审计系统，用于公开测量和跟踪大型语言模型（LLM）的拒绝行为，从而提高LLM透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的内容审核策略的影响。LLM的拒绝行为反映了公司政策并塑造了公共讨论，因此需要对其进行监测。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会问题的数据集，审计了OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（包括英文和中文）。

Result: 发现公司政策的变化可以通过AI Watchman检测到，并识别出公司和模型在内容审核方面的差异。对不同形式的拒绝行为进行了定性分析和分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，并提供了一个名为AI Watchman的系统来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为RJE的框架，用于提升知识图谱问答（KGQA）效果，特别是在使用小型语言模型（LLMs）时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KGQA方法要么依赖检索信息的质量，要么依赖大型私有LLMs，存在局限性。

Method: RJE框架包含检索精炼推理路径、评估其充分性以及条件探索额外证据三个步骤，并引入了推理路径排序、问题分解和检索器辅助探索等辅助模块，以支持小型LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，RJE框架在使用私有LLMs时优于现有基线，同时使小型开源LLMs在不进行微调的情况下也能达到有竞争力的结果。此外，RJE还显著减少了LLM调用次数和token使用量。

Conclusion: RJE框架能够在提升KGQA效果的同时，提高效率，并降低对大型私有LLMs的依赖。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了大型语言模型（LLM）中存在的政治偏见，发现它们普遍存在自由主义-威权主义倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在政治讨论中占据主导地位，但其内化的政治偏见会影响信息传播。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态、主题、情感和客观性来评估算法的政治倾向。对六个主流LLM的1800个模型响应进行了分析，并使用四个微调的分类算法计算偏差评估指标。

Result: 所有六个LLM都表现出自由主义-威权主义倾向，并存在推理覆盖和预设拒绝的情况。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机交互中的心理影响，以及内在偏见如何渗透到公共讨论中，导致政治格局的扭曲，最终可能表现为一致性或两极分化。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在不同情境下的拒绝行为，发现通过巧妙的社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层级结构，可以显著影响模型的拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层级结构如何影响模型的拒绝行为，特别是在涉及安全风险的任务中。

Method: 通过对OpenAI的gpt-oss-20b模型进行大量实验，测试不同情境下（包括网络安全威胁、合成信用卡号生成等）模型的拒绝行为，并使用复合提示、不同语言和角色扮演等方法来评估模型。

Result: 研究发现，复合提示可以将ZIP炸弹任务的辅助率从0%提高到97.5%；德语和法语中的正式语域通常比相应的英语提示更容易泄露信息；角色扮演可以绕过安全规则；AI辅助的强化方法可以将信息泄露降低到0%。此外，评估提示的措辞也会影响模型的行为，且OpenAI Moderation API在检测有帮助的输出方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型语言模型在安全性方面存在的潜在风险，并提出了改进建议，强调了在实际应用中进行全面安全评估的重要性。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

*Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言（豪萨语）环境中存在的安全漏洞，包括偏见、不准确和文化不敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑该模型对代表性不足的社区用户的可靠性。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行red-teaming，通过最小的提示诱导模型生成有害、文化不敏感和不准确的内容。通过礼貌或感激的语言提示，模型的安全协议似乎会放松，从而促进错误信息和放大仇恨言论。进行了一项调查，以了解模型对当地常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂的错误假设的严重性。

Result: 模型未能区分生食和加工食品，并纳入了贬低的文化谚语来构建不准确的论点。模型优先考虑目标语言中流利、听起来合理的输出，而不是安全性和真实性。

Conclusion: 这些缺陷主要是由于低资源语言环境中的安全调整不足造成的。集中于低资源环境，突出了当前red-teaming工作中的一个重大差距，并提供了一些建议。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Motivation: 现有的基于 logits 的检测器仅依赖于对数概率，这可能不是最优的。

Method: AdaDetectGPT 自适应地从训练数据中学习 witness function，以提高基于 logits 的检测器的性能。

Result: 大量数值研究表明，AdaDetectGPT 在各种数据集和 LLM 组合中几乎一致地改进了现有技术方法，改进幅度高达 58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT 是一种有效且通用的 LLM 文本检测器。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）彻底改变了自然语言处理，但它们的部署引发了对生成有害或不适当内容的担忧。

Method: 引入渐进式自我反思（PSR）技术，使LLM能够自我监控和动态纠正其输出。

Result: 实验结果表明，将PSR应用于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，攻击成功率从77.5%降低到5.9%，Llama-3.1-8B base从89.7%降低到5.6%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4%降低到3.8%，且不影响其在良性任务上的原始性能。此外，还引入了一种轻量级的自我反思预测器，可以根据输入复杂度估计最佳反思轮数。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思是一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过动态分配与输入风险相关的计算资源来增强LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法是为自回归LLM设计的，不适用于D-LLM，因为D-LLM的幻觉信号出现在多步去噪过程中。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，通过识别对幻觉响应信息量最大的子轨迹，来利用D-LLM多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号。

Result: 在各种开源D-LLM上的大量实验表明，TraceDet能够持续改进幻觉检测，与基线相比，AUROC平均提高15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet有效地利用了D-LLM中间去噪步骤进行幻觉检测，并在实验中取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Motivation: 情感分析有助于理解消费者的感受、观点和偏好。大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现推动了情感分析的发展。然而，书面语言的复杂性和评论语言的多样性阻碍了准确的情感分析。

Method: 使用来自孟加拉语和英语客户评论的4000个样本微调基于transformer的BERT模型和其他LLMs。

Result: 微调后的Llama-3.1-8B模型优于其他微调模型，总体准确率、精确率、召回率和F1值分别为95.5%、93%、88%和90%。

Conclusion: 参数高效的微调方法（LoRA和PEFT）可以降低计算开销，适用于资源有限的环境。LLMs在情感分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower

Motivation: 目前缺乏关于如何有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索来解决各种问题的实际指导。

Method: TUMIX框架并行运行多个agent，这些agent迭代地共享和改进基于问题和先前答案的响应。

Result: TUMIX在关键推理基准测试中，相对于Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上的最佳基线，平均准确率提高了3.55%。

Conclusion: Agent的多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过使用LLM自动优化agent设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够的置信度时停止改进，以仅49%的推理成本保持性能。进一步扩展可以实现更高的性能，但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

### [43] [HiSpec: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01336)
*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec: A hierarchical speculative decoding framework using early-exit models for efficient intermediate verification, improving LLM inference throughput without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification bottleneck in speculative decoding; existing intermediate verification methods have training overhead, increase memory footprint, and compromise accuracy.

Method: Proposes HiSpec, which uses early-exit (EE) models for low-overhead intermediate verification and reuses key-value caches and hidden states. Periodically validates draft tokens against the target model to maintain accuracy.

Result: HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28x on average and up to 2.01x compared to single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: HiSpec is an effective framework for high-throughput speculative decoding.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA: A prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs to improve performance on event-based question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with event-based questions, especially those requiring causal or temporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes TAG-EQA, a prompting framework that converts structured relations into natural-language statements and injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs. It spans nine prompting configurations, combining zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies with text-only, graph-only, and text+graph input modalities.

Result: Improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines on the TORQUESTRA benchmark, with gains up to 12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is effective.

Conclusion: Causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的语言模型响应自动评估方法，该方法利用语义嵌入距离匹配目标候选文本和模型生成的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前响应分类方法成本过高或脱离实际。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离进行结构自由的评估。

Result: 在3个数据集和3个不同的LM架构上测试，回归得分约为0.97，准确率约为96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在较低的计算成本下实现了对响应的稳健分类。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零样本或即插即用逆解算器LVTINO，用于高清晰度视频恢复，该解算器利用VCMs编码的先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图像的LDM先验逐帧应用通常导致时间上不一致的重建，将这些进展扩展到高清视频恢复仍然是一个重大挑战，由于需要恢复精细的空间细节，同时捕捉微妙的时间依赖性。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)，它将视频潜在扩散模型提炼成快速生成器，显式地捕捉时间因果关系。在此基础上，我们提出了LVTINO。

Result: 在各种视频逆问题上进行的大量实验表明，与当前逐帧应用图像ldm的最新方法相比，在感知上有显著的改进，在重建保真度和计算效率方面都建立了一个新的基准。

Conclusion: 我们提出了LVTINO，这是第一个零样本或即插即用逆解算器，用于高清晰度视频恢复与先验编码的vcm。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于文本到图像生成模型的图像生成方法，该方法通过从单个风格参考图像中获取细粒度的风格表示，并将其注入到生成主体中，以实现细粒度控制的风格化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言中，细粒度的风格无法被精确地描述和控制，而风格化参考图像的指导信息难以与传统文本指导生成的文本条件直接对齐。

Method: 本文提出了一种三阶段训练的基于风格提取的图像生成方法，该方法使用风格编码器和风格投影层来对齐风格表示和文本表示，以实现基于细粒度文本提示的风格引导生成。

Result: 本文构建了Style30k-captions数据集，其样本包含图像、风格标签和文本描述的三元组，用于训练风格编码器和风格投影层。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种有效的风格化图像生成方法，该方法可以实现细粒度控制，并具有良好的生成效果。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

TL;DR: 本文旨在构建一个用于研究技能学习过程中挣扎行为演变的视频数据集，并验证了时间行为定位模型在该数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作数据集缺乏对挣扎如何随时间演变的研究。理解这种演变是确定用户当前学习阶段的关键。

Method: 收集了一个包含 61.68 小时视频记录、2,793 个视频和 5,385 个带注释的时序挣扎片段的数据集，其中包括 18 个任务，分为四类不同的活动：结绳、折纸、七巧板和洗牌，参与者重复相同的任务五次。

Result: 时间行为定位模型可以成功学习检测挣扎线索，即使在未见过的任务或活动上进行评估也是如此。在跨任务泛化时，模型获得了 34.56% 的平均 mAP，在跨活动泛化时，模型获得了 19.24% 的平均 mAP。

Conclusion: 挣扎是各种基于技能的任务中可转移的概念，同时也对挣扎检测的进一步改进提出了挑战。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑且高效的基础模型，用于解决各种偏微分方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销高。SPUS利用轻量级残差U-Net架构，这种架构在该领域作为基础模型架构尚未得到充分探索。

Method: SPUS利用一种简单而强大的自回归预训练策略，紧密复制数值求解器的行为来学习底层物理。

Result: SPUS在使用基于残差U-Net的架构时，在这些下游任务上实现了最先进的泛化，同时需要的参数明显更少，并且只需要最少的微调数据。

Conclusion: SPUS有潜力成为一个用于解决各种PDE系统的高参数效率的基础模型。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在优化多人图像生成中的身份多样性，通过组合奖励和Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 来微调flow-matching模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的text-to-image模型在处理多人提示时，容易出现面部重复、身份合并和人数错误的问题。

Method: 使用基于强化学习的DisCo框架，通过GRPO和组合奖励来优化模型，该奖励包括惩罚图像内的面部相似性、避免跨样本的身份重复、确保准确的人数以及通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在DiverseHumans Testset上，DisCo实现了98.6%的Unique Face Accuracy和接近完美的Global Identity Spread，超过了其他方法，同时保持了有竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo是一个可扩展、无注释的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机，并为组合多人生成设定了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉地理定位方法在学习到的地理表示方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 该方法显式地将世界建模为地理嵌入的层次结构，并提出了一种有效地融合查询图像的外观特征与其语义分割图的方法，从而形成鲁棒的视觉表示。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，该方法在25个指标中的22个上都取得了优于现有技术水平（SOTA）方法和最近的大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）的改进。

Conclusion: 地理和视觉表示的结合是性能提升的主要驱动力。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据高效的LVLM指令调整方法XMAS，该方法通过聚类具有相似交叉模态注意矩阵的示例来减少数据冗余。


<details>

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在LVLM上表现不佳，无法在不同子集大小上胜过随机选择。

Method: XMAS：基于微调小型代理LVLM获得的注意力矩阵的顶部奇异值的轨迹对示例进行聚类，并从这些聚类中采样平衡子集。

Result: XMAS可以丢弃LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，同时完全保持LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准测试上的性能，并将其训练速度提高1.2倍。与LLaVA-665k的最佳基线相比，数据减少量增加了30%。

Conclusion: XMAS是一种有效减少LVLM训练数据冗余的方法，可以在保持性能的同时提高训练效率。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了结合连续方法的几何感知和离散监督的优势，实现更好的图像生成。

Method: 通过学习类别后验概率和在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场，将变分流匹配方法应用于向量量化的潜在空间。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，Purrception的训练收敛速度比连续和离散流匹配基线更快，并获得了具有竞争力的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配可以有效地桥接连续传输和离散监督，从而提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的深度学习框架，用于从非对比增强CT（NCCT）扫描生成合成的对比增强CT（CECT）图像，并同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，以减少对碘化造影剂的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对比增强CT（CECT）中碘化造影剂的使用，因为它们具有肾毒性、患者过敏和环境危害等风险。现有的深度学习方法通常采用多阶段流程，导致误差累积，且未能充分利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 该方法整合了条件扩散模型（CDM）与多任务学习，实现图像合成和解剖分割的端到端联合优化。该方法不需要初始预测，跨任务共享编码器和解码器参数，并采用半监督训练策略。

Result: 在264名患者的队列中进行评估，该模型在图像合成和解剖分割方面均优于现有技术。图像合成的PSNR为25.61 dB，Lumen Dice score提高到0.89，血栓Dice score提高到0.53。临床测量也更加准确。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的深度学习框架，可以在减少造影剂使用的同时，提高图像合成和解剖分割的准确性。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

Motivation: 分析多模态内容在计算上是棘手的，成本高，并且需要大量的工程工作。将静态数据上的预训练模型与视频等复杂数据融合相对具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了一个候选流水线配方，结合了一组预训练模型，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式。将这种结构进一步转换为帧级别索引的知识图表示，该表示可查询并支持持续学习，从而可以通过交互式媒介动态地整合新的领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 该框架支持查询，并支持持续学习，可以通过交互式媒介动态地整合新的领域特定知识。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping

temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 WALT 的 Web 代理框架，该框架通过逆向工程网站的潜在功能，将其转化为可重用的工具，从而实现更鲁棒的浏览器自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Web 代理方法依赖于逐步的 UI 交互和大量的 LLM 推理，这在动态布局和长视野下容易出错。而人类会利用网站提供的高级功能，如搜索、过滤和排序。

Method: WALT 框架逆向工程网站的潜在功能，将其转化为可重用的工具，涵盖发现、通信和内容管理等方面。这些工具抽象掉了低级别的执行细节。

Result: 在 VisualWebArena 和 WebArena 上，WALT 取得了更高的成功率，步骤更少，且对 LLM 的依赖更低。

Conclusion: WALT 建立了一个鲁棒且通用的浏览器自动化范例。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从无标签数据中捕获有意义的语义结构至关重要。在组织病理学图像分析中，对象密集分布，这是一个特别具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 利用通过随机dropout和时间训练快照获得的多重扰动预测，强制这些不同输出之间的拓扑一致性。引入了一种新的匹配策略，该策略将空间重叠与全局结构对齐相结合，从而最大限度地减少预测之间的差异。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法有效地减少了拓扑错误，从而实现了更强大、更准确的分割，这对于可靠的下游分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更鲁棒和准确地分割，对下游分析至关重要。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Diffusion-LPO 的框架，用于在扩散模型中进行列表式偏好优化，利用列表数据提升图像生成质量和偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 DPO 方法主要依赖成对偏好，忽略了人类反馈中蕴含的列表式排序信息，而这些信息能更精确地反映人类偏好。

Method: 提出了 Diffusion-LPO 框架，通过 Plackett-Luce 模型扩展 DPO 目标，鼓励每个样本优于所有排名较低的替代方案，从而在整个排序中保持一致性。

Result: 在文本生成图像、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务上，Diffusion-LPO 始终优于成对 DPO 基线，提高了视觉质量和偏好对齐。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO 是一种简单有效的列表式偏好优化框架，能够提升扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

TL;DR: Bridge是一个纯自回归的统一多模态大语言模型，它通过混合Transformer架构增强了预训练的视觉理解模型，使其具有生成能力，从而在单个下一个token预测框架内实现图像理解和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成能力的统一多模态大语言模型仍然具有挑战性：混合方法将连续嵌入与扩散或基于流的目标相结合，产生高质量的图像，但打破了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法统一了文本和图像预测，但通常需要在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间进行权衡。

Method: Bridge通过混合Transformer架构增强了预训练的视觉理解模型，并通过一种语义到像素的离散表示，集成了紧凑的语义tokens和细粒度的像素tokens。

Result: Bridge在各种多模态基准测试中取得了有竞争力或更优越的结果，同时与之前的统一MLLM相比，需要更少的训练数据和更短的训练时间。

Conclusion: Bridge是一个有效的统一多模态大语言模型，它在理解和生成任务中都表现出色，并且具有训练效率高的优点。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卷积神经网络（CNN）和贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于在小训练集下进行口腔癌分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型依赖于点估计，导致过度自信和可靠性降低，且需要大型数据集，这在训练数据有限的情况下是不现实的。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络（CNN）与贝叶斯深度学习，使用变分推断来通过不确定性量化提高可靠性。模型使用智能手机拍摄的彩色照片图像进行训练，并在三个不同的测试数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在与训练数据分布相似的测试数据集上，该方法达到了 94% 的准确率，与传统 CNN 的性能相当。对于真实世界的摄影图像数据，该模型表现出优越的泛化能力，在不同数据集上达到了 88% 的准确率，而传统 CNN 的准确率为 72.94%。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推断在数据稀缺的环境中，通过提高模型的可靠性和泛化性，可有效增强口腔癌的早期诊断。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法容易受到困难样本和领域偏差的影响，并且不能充分代表多样性。

Method: 构建辅助域模块以获得多样化的表示，并通过多重一致性策略获得不变特征表示，使用条件多核最大平均差异（CMK-MMD）策略对齐困难样本和简单样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等基准数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的性能。

Conclusion: CADTrans通过构建领域一致性的不变特征表示，有效地提升了源域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉解释应用中，为盲人和低视力用户提供的信息过于冗长和缺乏针对性，导致交流效率低下。

Method: 该系统通过从 VizWiz-LF 数据集中识别相似的过去视觉情境，并利用相关问题来指导 MLLM 生成更贴近盲人和低视力用户需求的描述。

Result: 人工评估表明， context-aware 的描述在 76.1% 的情况下预测并回答了用户的问题，并且在 54.4% 的比较中更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，利用历史用户问题可以有效提高多模态大语言模型生成视觉描述的针对性和有效性，从而改善盲人和低视力用户的体验。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法，即零空间非线性投影（NPN），它促进了解位于具有神经网络的传感矩阵的零空间的低维投影中的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的先验信息通常忽略了零空间的特定任务结构。为了解决这个问题，我们专注于零空间的结构，并设计了特定于传感矩阵的先验信息，这些先验信息捕获了与信号分量正交的信息，而这些信号分量从根本上来说对传感过程是盲目的。

Method: 我们提出了零空间非线性投影（NPN），它通过神经网络促进了解位于传感矩阵零空间的低维投影中的解决方案。我们从理论上保证了在即插即用方法中使用的收敛性和重建精度。

Result: 在各种传感矩阵上的经验结果表明，NPN先验始终可以提高各种成像逆问题（如压缩感知，去模糊，超分辨率，计算机断层扫描和磁共振成像）中的重建保真度，并结合了即插即用方法，展开网络，深度图像先验和扩散模型。

Conclusion: NPN 是一种适用于各种逆问题的正则化方法，与现有的重建框架兼容，并且可以补充传统的图像域先验。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological

into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art

favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging

this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

Result: VLA-R1在多个平台上的评估表明，与之前的VLA方法相比，VLA-R1实现了卓越的泛化和实际性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过强化推理和执行，提高了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We

<details>

Motivation: 微距镜头具有高分辨率和高放大率的优点，对小型和细节物体进行3D建模可以提供更丰富的信息。然而，微距摄影中的散焦模糊是一个长期存在的问题，严重阻碍了所捕获物体的清晰成像及其高质量的3D重建。

Method: 从捕获的多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微渲染方法来自我监督3D模型和散焦模糊核的优化。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像中，该方法不仅可以实现高质量的图像去模糊，还可以恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法提出了一种有效的微距摄影3D重建方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Motivation: 现有的基于CNN和Transformer的图像去模糊技术取得了显著进展，但大型预训练扩散模型在图像恢复任务中表现出更强的生成能力，但推理时间和保真度受限。

Method: 将运动去模糊重构为扩散过程，训练一致性模型对齐所有时间步到同一清晰图像，并集成Kernel ControlNet进行模糊核估计和自适应时间步预测。

Conclusion: FideDiff为将预训练扩散模型应用于高保真图像恢复任务提供了一个新方向，并为进一步推进扩散模型在实际工业应用中的发展奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Motivation: 由于严重的视觉退化、照片、摩擦和示踪图之间的多域可变性以及极长的字符分布，自动 BI 识别仍然很困难。

Method: 该方法包括一个两阶段检测识别流程，该流程首先定位铭文，然后转录单个字符。为了处理异构域和稀有类，该流程配备了 LadderMoE，它使用 ladder-style MoE 适配器增强了预训练的 CLIP 编码器，从而实现了动态专家专业化和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

TL;DR: VirDA: a parameter-efficient UDA method using visual reprogramming to adapt textural bias for domain adaptation, achieving comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune backbone parameters for each new source-and-target pair, increasing training parameters and storage memory linearly and preventing backbone reuse. Existing backbones have textural biases.

Method: VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the backbone, generating visual prompts to add textural bias and adapt the image style to the target domain. It optimizes visual reprogramming layers using multiple objectives that address intra- and inter-domain distribution differences without modifying backbone parameters.

Result: VirDA achieves 92.8% mean accuracy on Office-31 with 1.5M trainable parameters, surpassing PDA by +1.6% accuracy using 46% of its parameters. It outperforms CDTrans and FixBi while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8% of their trainable parameters. Compared to PMTrans and TVT, VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters with a trade-off of only 2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: VirDA is a parameter-efficient UDA method

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

*Minh Tran,Maksim Siniukov,Zhangyu Jin,Mohammad Soleymani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的面部表情分析方法，即离散面部编码 (DFE)，它是一种无监督、数据驱动的方法，可以从 3D 网格序列中学习紧凑且可解释的面部表情词典。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面部动作编码系统 (FACS) 受到覆盖范围有限和手动注释成本高昂的限制。

Method: 使用残差向量量化变分自动编码器 (RVQ-VAE) 从 3D 网格序列中学习紧凑且可解释的面部表情词典。该方法首先使用 3D 形变模型 (3DMM) 从图像中提取与身份无关的表情特征，然后使用 RVQ-VAE 对这些特征进行编码，从而生成来自共享代码本的离散 tokens 序列。

Result: 离散面部编码比 FACS 和其他面部编码替代方案能捕捉到更精确的面部行为。在压力检测、人格预测和抑郁症检测三个高级心理任务中，优于基于 FACS 的管道以及强大的图像和视频表示学习模型，如 Masked Autoencoders。

Conclusion: 离散面部编码 (DFE) 涵盖了更广泛的面部展示，具有作为 FACS 在心理和情感计算应用中可扩展且有效的替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和真实数据集上都表现出色，代码将在项目网站上公开提供。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于密集观测来优化模型参数，为了解决这个问题，作者将鲁棒重建解耦为恢复和重建两个子任务，从而简化优化过程。

Method: 首先将不一致的图像转换为初始视频，然后使用专门设计的视频扩散模型将它们恢复为一致的图像，最后从这些恢复的图像中重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法具有很强的泛化能力和优越的性能。

Conclusion: UniVerse可以控制重建的3D场景的风格，并在鲁棒重建中表现出色

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的端到端模板匹配框架，用于在复杂背景下估计目标的位置和几何状态（旋转和缩放），以支持精确的下游操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于角度和尺度的穷举枚举，导致复合变换下的效率低下。同时，大多数基于深度学习的方法只估计相似度分数，而没有明确地建模几何姿态，这使得它们不足以用于实际部署。

Method: 将模板匹配重新 формулируется 为联合定位和几何回归，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立的水平和垂直比例。提出了一个模板感知动态卷积模块（TDCM），在推理时动态注入模板特征以指导可推广的匹配。紧凑的网络集成了深度可分离卷积和像素 shuffle 以实现高效匹配。引入了一种基于旋转剪切的增强策略，带有结构感知的伪标签，以实现无几何注释的训练。一个轻量级的细化模块通过局部优化进一步提高了角度和尺度的精度。

Result: 3.07M 模型实现了高精度和 14ms 的复合变换下的推理。它还在小模板和多对象场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型非常适合在实时工业应用中部署。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应像素推理框架，旨在提高视觉语言模型在处理细粒度视觉元素时的性能，并减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在需要精确理解和处理细粒度视觉元素的任务中表现不佳，主要是由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域的关注不足。虽然引入像素级视觉信息有所帮助，但过度使用会导致效率低下和注意力分散。

Method: 该论文首先应用操作感知的监督微调，以建立文本推理和视觉操作的基线能力，然后设计了一种新颖的rollout-guided强化学习框架，该框架依赖于模型自身响应的反馈，使 VLM 能够根据查询难度确定何时应调用像素操作。

Result: 该模型在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中取得了优异的性能，同时显著减少了不必要的视觉操作。在 HR-Bench 4K 上实现了 73.4% 的准确率，同时保持了仅 20.1% 的工具使用率，与之前的方法相比，提高了准确率，同时将工具使用率降低了 66.5%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的自适应像素推理框架能够有效提高视觉语言模型在处理细粒度视觉元素时的性能，并减少不必要的视觉操作。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片解释中表现出色，但公平性和可靠性问题仍然存在。模型在患者亚组中经常表现出不均衡的准确性，导致隐藏的失败。

Method: 该框架应用临床上合理的旋转，并使用RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入偏移。

Result: 敏感性评分将样本分层为稳定性四分位数，其中高度敏感的病例显示出明显较低的召回率，尽管具有较高的AUROC和置信度。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无标签的方法，用于选择性预测和临床医生审查，从而提高医学人工智能的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 FreeViS 的免训练视频风格化框架，该框架能够生成具有丰富风格细节和强大时间一致性的风格化视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频风格化在内容创作中起着关键作用，但仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。简单地逐帧应用图像风格化会损害时间一致性并降低风格丰富性。或者，训练一个专用的视频风格化模型通常需要配对的视频数据，并且计算成本很高。

Method: 该方法将多个风格化参考整合到预训练的图像到视频 (I2V) 模型中，有效缓解了先前工作中观察到的传播错误，而没有引入闪烁和卡顿。此外，它利用高频补偿来约束内容布局和运动，并结合基于流的运动线索来保留低显着性区域中的风格纹理。

Result: 通过广泛的评估，FreeViS 提供了更高的风格化保真度和卓越的时间一致性，优于最近的基线并实现了强大的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 我们的免训练管道为高质量、时间连贯的视频风格化提供了一种实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量、基于分数的指标，未能反映专家评估中描述性的、类似人类的推理过程。

Method: 定义了两个互补的任务：MedQ-Perception，通过人工策划的问题探测低级感知能力；MedQ-Reasoning，包含无参考和比较推理任务，使模型评估与人类对图像质量的推理方式对齐。提出了一个多维判断协议，从四个互补的维度评估模型输出。

Result: 对14个最先进的MLLM的评估表明，模型表现出初步但不稳定的感知和推理技能，准确性不足以用于可靠的临床使用。

Conclusion: 强调需要在医学IQA中对MLLM进行有针对性的优化。MedQ-Bench将促进进一步探索，并释放MLLM在医学图像质量评估中未开发的潜力。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

Motivation: 现有的实例几何理解系统依赖于昂贵的输入格式（类别标签，二值分割掩码）和推理成本（二次数量的前向传递）。

Method: 提出InstaFormer网络，该网络依赖于对象查询和潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，这些描述符在语义上表示相同的对象，同时携带互补信息。

Result: 对InstaFormer进行了全面的基准测试和消融研究，以突出其有效性。

Conclusion: InstaFormer仅需单次前向传递即可预测完整遮挡和深度排序，有效降低了成本。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this

Motivation: Existing NST models inefficient with complex styles/high-res inputs.

Method: Transformer with pyramidal positional encoding and RL-based optimization.

Result: Reduces content/style loss, achieves real-time rendering.

Conclusion: Demonstrates real-time, high-quality artistic rendering.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media

TL;DR: LoBE-GS: A load-balanced and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for large-scale scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes is difficult due to load imbalance and inefficient coarse-to-fine pipelines.

Method: Depth-aware partitioning, optimization-based load balancing, visibility cropping, and selective densification.

Result: Up to 2x faster end-to-end training than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability.

Conclusion: LoBE-GS re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline for improved efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成模型需要捕捉长期依赖关系，并且避免自回归解码中固有的误差累积。

Method: 提出了MemoryPack，一种可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖关系。同时，引入了Direct Forcing，一种有效的单步近似策略，以改善训练-推理对齐。

Result: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing显著提高了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 本研究提升了自回归视频模型的实际可用性。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DiffPS的新框架，用于人员搜索，该框架利用预训练的扩散模型，同时消除了两个子任务之间的优化冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用ImageNet预训练的骨干网络，这可能无法最好地捕捉人员搜索所需的复杂空间环境和细粒度身份线索。此外，它们依赖于共享的骨干特征来进行人员检测和重新识别，由于优化目标冲突，导致特征不佳。

Method: 该论文提出了DiffPS，它利用预训练的扩散模型，并提出了三个专门的模块：(i)用于增强人员定位的扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)，(ii)用于减轻形状偏差的多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)，以及(iii)用于利用文本对齐扩散特征的语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)。

Result: DiffPS在CUHK-SYSU和PRW上创造了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: DiffPS是一种用于人员搜索的新框架，它利用预训练的扩散模型，同时消除了两个子任务之间的优化冲突，并在CUHK-SYSU和PRW上创造了新的技术水平。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

*Yi Ai,Yuanhao Cai,Yulun Zhang,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高光谱图像（HSI）重建方法，该方法将流匹配整合到深度展开框架中，以提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）由于硬件限制和从压缩测量中重建三维数据的难度，获取成本仍然很高，并且精确重建仍然面临严重退化和丢失精细光谱细节的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种流匹配引导的展开网络（FMU），通过将流匹配的生成先验嵌入到深度展开框架中，并将平均速度损失以增强学习的动态性，从而实现更鲁棒和准确的重建。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，FMU 在重建质量方面明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU 方法有效地结合了基于优化的方法的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力，显著提高了高光谱图像的重建质量。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化缺陷检测系统，用于检测双列直插封装（DIP）的表面和引脚缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业元件的缺陷检测耗时费力，给质检人员带来沉重负担，难以管理产品质量。

Method: 使用数字相机光学器件和基于深度学习的模型，并使用ConSinGAN生成数据集进行训练和测试。研究了YOLO模型的四个变体（v3、v4、v7和v9）。

Result: YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN的准确率达到95.50%，检测时间为285ms，远优于基于阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动化缺陷检测系统可以很容易地应用于多种类型的缺陷或缺陷数据不足的情况。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

TL;DR: FoundAD:利用预训练视觉编码器进行少样本异常检测，通过学习非线性投影算子来识别图像中的异常区域，参数量少且性能有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在少样本和类别不可知的情况下，准确区分正常和异常特征非常困难。预训练视觉编码器通过学习大量正常图像的分布来解决这个问题。

Method: 学习一个非线性投影算子，将图像投影到自然图像流形上，通过嵌入差异来检测异常。

Result: 实验表明，该方法支持多类别检测，且参数量远少于现有方法，同时具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了对基础特征的视角，并推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers are accurate but complex. ClustViT reduces complexity for real-world robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have quadratic attention complexity, limiting their use in real-world robotic systems, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes ClustViT, which uses a trainable Cluster module to merge similar tokens guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks, and a Regenerator module to restore fine details.

Result: ClustViT achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference with comparable segmentation accuracy on three datasets.

Conclusion: ClustViT reduces the computational cost of Vision Transformers while maintaining accuracy for semantic segmentation, making it more suitable for real-world robotic systems. Code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT: A new paradigm enabling MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs by using Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

Method: Introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions.

Result: PaDT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across four visual perception and understanding tasks, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models.

Conclusion: PaDT improves localization and differentiation among similar objects.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: OR-Toolformer，通过微调 Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct 并结合外部求解器，在 OR 任务上取得了很好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用闭源 API 进行 OR 任务存在隐私问题，从头开始训练开源模型计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用半自动数据合成管线生成多样的 OR 问题-答案对，并使用外部求解器增强模型以产生 API 调用，从而微调 Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上，OR-Toolformer 的执行准确率高达 80.1%，超过了同等规模的基线模型 4.3% 以上。在两种未见过的 OR 问题类型上进行零样本评估时，平均准确率达到 54%，比最强的基线模型提高了 21 个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究结果验证了工具增强的微调 LLM 在准确和泛化的 OR 问题建模和求解方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ROTE的新算法，用于预测人类行为，该算法利用大型语言模型和概率推理，通过将日常社交互动建模为行为程序来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的行为建模方法通常需要大量数据，并且由于对理性的不切实际的假设或过高的计算需求而显得脆弱。该论文的核心思想是许多日常社交互动可能遵循可预测的模式，即“脚本”，从而减少参与者和观察者的认知负荷。

Method: 该论文提出ROTE算法，该算法利用大型语言模型（LLM）来合成行为程序的假设空间，并利用概率推理来推理该空间的不确定性。将这些日常行为建模为计算机代码中实例化的行为程序，而不是以信念和愿望为条件的策略。

Result: ROTE在网格世界任务和大型具身家庭模拟器中进行了测试，通过稀疏的观察预测人类和AI行为，在样本内准确率和样本外泛化方面，优于包括行为克隆和基于LLM的方法在内的竞争基线，高达50%。

Conclusion: 通过将动作理解视为一个程序合成问题，ROTE为AI系统高效且有效地预测现实世界中的人类行为开辟了一条道路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Result: 知识库增强机制平均提高了所有七个专家智能体10-15%的对话质量得分；协作智能体使远域专家对的协作效率提高了8.5%，近域专家对仅提高了0.8%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构可以为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供可行的途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

Motivation: 传统的评估基准无法捕捉到当智能体在交互环境中交流、说服和协作时出现的突发社会和认知动态。

Method: 使用基于LLM的智能体，这些智能体被实例化为具有不同角色和激励机制，在LLM主持人的监督下，就广泛的具有挑战性的主题进行审议。

Result: 研究结果表明，智能体具有寻求共识的强大而稳健的突发趋势，即使没有明确的指示，并且在敏感话题上也能始终达到高度的语义一致性。分配的角色会产生稳定、可测量的心理测量概况，尤其是在认知努力方面，并且主持人的角色可以通过构建环境来显着改变辩论结果，这是外部AI对齐的关键发现。

Conclusion: 这项工作为一类新的动态的、以心理测量为基础的评估协议提供了一个蓝图，该协议专为智能体环境而设计，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了一种关键的方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Motivation: 现有上下文和记忆基准主要集中在对话实例上，但评估动态企业环境中的记忆对于其有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过整合Slack、Linear和Git等多个通信和生产力平台上的异步事件，MEMTRACK模拟了真实的组织工作流程。该基准提供了一个按时间顺序排列的平台交叉时间线，其中包含嘈杂、冲突、交叉引用的信息以及潜在的代码库/文件系统理解和探索。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展的框架，超越了现有对会话设置的关注，并为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Conclusion: 这项工作是朝着将生成式AI集成到实际临床决策中的初步尝试，重点在于透明度、安全性和与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

### [98] [Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01367)
*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TRACE的新方法，用于检测推理模型中隐式的奖励作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励作弊对模型构成了重大威胁，尤其是在隐式作弊难以被发现的情况下。

Method: TRACE通过测量模型推理在多大程度上能够通过验证器来量化模型所付出的努力。它通过逐渐截断模型的CoT，并测量在每个截断点验证器通过率来实现。

Result: TRACE在数学推理方面比最强的72B CoT监测器提升了超过65%的效果，在编码方面比32B监测器提升了超过30%的效果。TRACE还可以发现训练过程中未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督方法，用于在当前监测方法无效的情况下进行监督。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

### [99] [Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375)
*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过知识蒸馏将检索增强生成(RAG)的优势内化到大型语言模型(LLM)中的方法，以解决LLM在多步骤任务中常见的失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步骤任务中常因未满足前提条件、发出冗余命令或处理环境约束不当而失败。检索增强生成(RAG)虽然可以通过提供运行时指导来提高性能，但需要维护外部知识数据库并增加计算开销。

Method: 该方法包括：(1) 从agent失败中提取紧凑、可重用的提示；(2) 使用这些提示通过episode start时的一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3) 训练学生模型，去除提示字符串，迫使内化而不是记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互基准测试中，经过蒸馏的学生模型始终优于基线agent，ALFWorld上的成功率高达91%（基线为79%），WebShop上的分数提高到72（基线为61），同时比检索增强的教师模型使用的token减少10-60%。

Conclusion: 该方法可以跨模型规模（7B/14B参数）和agent架构（ReAct/StateAct）推广，证明了检索优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效地内化，而无需永久的运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLM）代理来自动化数据驱动建模和分析的创新流程，特别是在回归任务中。该方法在临界热通量（CHF）预测基准上进行了验证，结果表明，该模型超越了传统的 CHF 查找表，并达到了与人类专家开发的贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当的预测精度和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动方法需要大量的人工干预，限制了它们有效扩展和推广到不同应用的能力。因此，需要开发能够自动化数据驱动建模和分析的方法。

Method: 该研究评估了两种 LLM 代理框架：一个具有专业协作代理的多代理系统和一个基于推理和行动（ReAct）范式的单代理系统。这两个框架都能够自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化（UQ）。

Result: 结果表明，该研究中LLM代理开发的模型超越了传统的 CHF 查找表，并达到了与人类专家开发的贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当的预测精度和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理具有自动化复杂工程建模任务的巨大潜力，可以在满足或超过现有预测性能标准的同时，大大减少人类的工作量。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 OntoLogX 的自主 AI 代理，它利用大型语言模型将原始日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，用于网络威胁情报 (CTI)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从日志中提取可操作的 CTI 受到缺乏结构、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化等问题的限制。

Method: OntoLogX 集成了轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成 (RAG) 和迭代校正步骤，以确保生成的 KG 在句法和语义上有效。它还将 KG 聚合到会话中，并使用 LLM 来预测 MITRE ATT&CK 策略。

Result: 在公共基准和真实蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX 能够生成强大的 KG，并将对抗活动准确地映射到 ATT&CK 策略。

Conclusion: 结果强调了检索和校正对精度和召回率的好处，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中的有效性，以及基于本体的表示对于可操作的 CTI 提取的价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer结合了LLM的推理能力和轻量级代理模型，以实现可扩展的知识挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）擅长解释用户指令，但大规模部署成本过高，而传统分类器和提取器的pipeline虽然高效，但脆弱且无法推广到新任务。

Method: Falconer框架利用LLM作为规划者，将用户指令分解为可执行的pipeline，并作为注释器，生成监督信息来训练小型代理模型。该框架将分类和提取统一为两个原子操作：get label和get span。

Result: 实验表明，Falconer在指令跟随准确性方面与最先进的LLM非常接近，同时降低了高达90%的推理成本，并将大规模知识挖掘加速了20倍以上。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

TL;DR: VOGUE通过在视觉输入空间中引入不确定性引导探索，提升了多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在强化学习中，忽略了视觉输入中的不确定性，导致探索不足。

Method: VOGUE量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，利用对称KL散度创建不确定性感知探索信号，并结合token-entropy奖励和退火采样计划来平衡探索和利用。

Result: VOGUE在视觉数学和通用领域推理基准测试中，将pass@1准确率平均提高了2.6%和3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能，并缓解了探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 在视觉输入的不确定性中进行探索是提高多模态推理的有效策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT) mitigates breadth saturation and depth myopia in large test-time compute by separating utility from logical consistency, treating consistent candidates as assets, and using Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC) to explore them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Tree-of-Thoughts search suffers from breadth saturation and depth myopia under large compute budgets.

Method: LToT splits the frontier into mainlines and laterals, exploring laterals via LR--SC, a capped successive-halving race with width-aware thresholds and repeat-to-confirm, while keeping mainlines narrow.

Result: Proves a pseudolinear lateral cost and anticipates empirical evaluations in future revisions.

Conclusion: LToT turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating compute.

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在数学推理任务中的token表示和生成过程。

Method: 首先，训练一个SAE来生成稀疏向量表示；然后，应用k-means聚类构建一个图，顶点代表token簇，加权边捕捉连续token转换；使用该图定义一个基于边权重的奖励函数，量化对已建立的推理轨迹的坚持程度；测量来自聚类的生成多样性以评估探索的程度。

Result: 平衡利用和探索对于在数学推理任务中实现高精度至关重要。

Conclusion: SAE可以作为可扩展的奖励模型来指导生成，确保利用和探索之间的平衡权衡，从而在LLM中培养更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Motivation: 在法律和医学等关键领域，高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。这种推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编纂的前提，这些前提本质上涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，因为存在大量例外情况，引入单一事实可能会使一般规则失效，从而带来重大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为LOGicalThought (LogT) 的神经符号架构，该架构使用高级逻辑语言和推理器以及LLM来构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文。

Result: 在针对四个基准的四个多域基准上进行评估，LogT 在所有 LLM 上的总体性能提高了 11.84%。在所有三种推理模式中，性能均显着提高：在否定方面高达 +10.2%，在蕴涵方面高达 +13.2%，在可废止推理方面高达 +5.5%，与最强的基线相比。

Conclusion: LogT 是一种很有前途的神经符号架构，它能够提高 LLM 在高保证推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM规划代理通常忽略了其内部动态和实际环境之间的差异。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: InfoSeeker通过规划行动来主动收集信息，以验证其理解，检测环境变化或在生成或修改面向任务的计划之前测试假设。

Result: InfoSeeker在部分可观察环境中实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率。它还能在LLM之间推广，并在机器人操作和Web导航等基准测试中优于基线。

Conclusion: 紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于在部分可观察环境中实现稳健行为至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Conclusion: 本研究通过理论框架和 SAPO 算法，解决了扩散语言模型在复杂推理训练中存在的问题，提高了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink: 通过让LLM在生成回复前先考虑失败模式来进行推理，从而提高安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全对齐方法直接优化安全回复，但InvThink另辟蹊径，指示模型列举潜在危害，分析其后果，并生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。

Method: 通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实施InvThink。

Result: (i) 与现有的安全方法相比，安全性的提高与模型大小的比例更高。(ii) InvThink减轻了安全税；通过训练模型系统地考虑失败模式，它保留了标准基准上的一般推理能力。(iii) 除了通用安全任务外，InvThink在包括面向外部（医学、金融、法律）和能动性（勒索、谋杀）风险场景等高风险领域表现出色，与SafetyPrompt等基线方法相比，有害响应最多减少了15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展且通用的途径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL: A co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for multi-agent systems against attacks like jailbreak and prompt-injection either underperform or increase system overhead and complexity.

Method: Jointly optimizes attackers and defenders in adversarial learning environments, using a public baseline for advantage estimation to stabilize learning and foster cooperation.

Result: Consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks).

Conclusion: Safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

TL;DR: AgentRec: LLM-powered multi-agent framework for conversational recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle with dynamic preferences, coherence, and balancing ranking objectives.

Method: Hierarchical agent networks with adaptive weighting, 3-tier learning (rapid, reasoning, collaboration).

Result: Improved conversation success (2.8%), recommendation accuracy (1.9%), and efficiency (3.2%) over baselines.

Conclusion: AgentRec effectively addresses limitations in conversational recommendation.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成能力方面表现出色，但在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 引入PsychoBench，一个基于美国国家咨询师考试的基准，包含2252个单选题，用于全面评估LLM作为咨询师的能力。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型达到或超过了及格线，而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）则远低于及格线。

Conclusion: 只有前沿的LLM目前能够达到咨询考试标准，这既展示了开发面向心理学的LLM的希望，也突出了挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的信息论摘要方法，用于压缩上下文马尔可夫决策过程（CMDPs）中的上下文输入，以提高决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力不足，导致计算量过大和性能不稳定。

Method: 使用LLM将上下文输入压缩成低维、语义丰富的摘要，通过保留决策关键信息并减少冗余来增强状态表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的摘要方法为在资源受限的富上下文环境中进行高效决策提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Method: 将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，要求模型重建被屏蔽的GPS轨迹，并引入GLOBALTRACE数据集。

Result: LLM优于现成的基线模型和专门的轨迹恢复模型，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM对道路网络和坐标系有很强的理解能力，但也存在与地区和交通方式相关的系统性偏差。LLM可以通过以灵活的方式对地图进行推理来增强导航体验，从而整合用户偏好。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUA被越来越多地部署，但其盲目目标导向性会带来潜在风险。

Method: 构建了一个包含90个任务的基准测试BLIND-ACT，用于评估CUA的BGD。

Result: 对包括Claude Sonnet和GPT-5在内的九个模型进行评估，发现它们普遍存在较高的BGD率(80.8%)。

Conclusion: 需要更强的训练或推理时干预来降低BGD，并确保CUA的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Motivation: 患者在等待侵入性手术时，往往存在未解答的术前问题；然而，时间紧张的工作流程和隐私限制了个性化的咨询。

Method: 我们提出了LENOHA（低能耗、无幻觉、不遗漏任何人的架构），这是一个安全至上的本地系统，它使用高精度句子转换器分类器路由输入，并从临床医生策划的常见问题解答中返回临床查询的原文答案，从而消除了临床路径中的自由文本生成。

Result: 在四个编码器中，E5-large-instruct (560M) 实现了 0.983 的总体准确率（95% CI 0.964-0.991），AUC 0.996，以及总共七个错误，这在统计上与 GPT-4o 在这项任务上没有区别；Gemini 在这个测试集中没有出现错误。能源记录显示，非生成临床路径每个输入消耗约 1.0 mWh，而来自本地 8B SLM 的小对话回复消耗约 168 mWh，相差约 170 倍，同时在单个本地 GPU 上保持约 0.10 秒的延迟。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，通过逐字返回经过审查的常见问题解答答案，在临床路径中结构性地避免了接近前沿的区分和生成引起的错误，从而支持了隐私、可持续性和在带宽受限环境中公平的部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术忽略了合成偏好注释中普遍存在的噪声，例如风格和长度偏差，这会影响大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）与人类偏好对齐的效果。

Method: 该论文引入了一个基于LLM引导的response编辑的hard-negative response生成框架，该框架能够生成具有目标错误的rejected responses，同时保持与accepted responses在风格和长度上的相似性。利用此框架，他们构建了一个包含3万个高质量样本的VaPR数据集，用于微调三个LVLM家族。

Result: 使用VaPR数据集训练的VaPR模型在十个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，平均增益分别为6.5% (LLaVA)、4.0% (Qwen2VL)和1.5% (Qwen2.5VL)，在推理任务上表现出显著的改进。同时，VaPR还降低了LVLM在二元问题中回答“Yes”的倾向。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，所提出的框架可以推广到开源LLM作为编辑器，并且性能随着数据规模的增加而持续提高。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT is an AI system using large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL for querying knowledge graphs, making metabolomics data more accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective use of knowledge graphs requires understanding of ontology and query language syntax, which presents a barrier to many users.

Method: A multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external tools and information sources. The system breaks down complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent.

Result: MetaboT achieved 83.67% accuracy on metabolomics-related questions, compared to 8.16% accuracy of a standard LLM (GPT-4o) baseline.

Conclusion: MetaboT enables researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language queries, removing technical barriers and facilitating data-driven discoveries.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is
accessible at [https://metabot.holobiomicslab.eu/], and its source code is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个用于军事行动中人机团队的可信赖的协同学习模型，并为进一步发展负责任和值得信赖的人机团队系统提供了具体的例证和建议。

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 PTA-GRPO 的两阶段框架，旨在通过改进高层次规划和细粒度 CoT 推理来提升 LLM 的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现出卓越的推理能力，但由于其自回归 token 级别生成，推理过程很大程度上受限于局部决策，缺乏全局规划，导致冗余、不连贯或不准确的推理。

Method: 首先，利用先进的 LLM 将 CoT 提炼为紧凑的高层次指导，然后用于监督微调（SFT）。其次，引入了一种指导感知的 RL 方法，联合优化最终输出和高层次指导的质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中进行了广泛的实验，包括 MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025 和 AMC，跨越了不同的基础模型，如 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B 和 LLaMA3.2-3B。实验结果表明，PTA-GRPO 在不同的模型和任务中始终如一地实现了稳定和显著的改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO 能够有效提升 LLM 的推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

### [127] [Learning a Dense Reasoning Reward Model from Expert Demonstration via Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01857)
*Claudio Fanconi,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大型语言模型推理的对抗逆强化学习 (IRL) 方法，学习token级别的奖励模型，用于过程监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从专家演示中学习，而非通过监督微调模仿风格。

Method: 利用学习到的推理奖励在训练期间优化推理策略，并在推理时作为评论员重新排序采样轨迹。

Result: 该方法优先考虑正确性而非表面形式，产生的评分与最终答案的有效性相关，并能够对轨迹中的错误进行可解释的定位。在 GSM8K 数据集上，使用 Llama3 和 Qwen2.5 作为backbones 的实验表明，密集推理奖励可以用作学习信号来引发推理，并且通过奖励引导的重新排序提高了预测性能。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和token级别诊断统一到一个推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级别奖励具有增强语言模型中多步骤推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的约束自适应拒绝采样方法(CARS)，以提高生成输出的效率和多样性，同时满足语义或句法约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的约束生成方法要么在解码过程中强制执行有效性，要么通过拒绝采样来保持保真度，但效率较低，尤其是在程序模糊等领域，有效性和多样性都很重要。

Method: CARS通过记录在trie树中违反约束的延续，并从未来的抽取中减去它们的概率质量，从而自适应地排除违反约束的延续。

Result: 在程序模糊和分子生成等多个领域的实验表明，CARS在效率和样本多样性方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CARS能够提高拒绝采样的样本效率，且不会造成分布失真，同时保证了样本的多样性。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，因此检查它们与人类社会推理的一致性至关重要。本研究提出了一个评估集体一致性的经验框架，并进行了一项大规模在线实验，模拟匹配的LLM组，以评估它们在集体推理中与人类行为的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在集体决策中的应用，并考察它们与人类社会推理的一致性。

Method: 使用“海上迷失”社会心理学任务，进行大规模在线实验（N=748），随机分配具有可见人口属性或假名别名的群体进行领导人选举。然后，模拟匹配的LLM组，以评估Gemini 2.5、GPT 4.1、Claude Haiku 3.5和Gemma 3的行为。

Result: LLM的行为各不相同：有些反映了人类的偏见；另一些则掩盖了这些偏见并试图弥补它们。人机在集体推理中的一致性取决于背景、线索和特定于模型的归纳偏见。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为保持一致对于推进社会一致的人工智能至关重要，并且需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种确定性模拟框架，用于评估AI生成的同行评审报告，旨在解决学术出版中投稿量过大和AI监管不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统同行评审缺乏可扩展性和客观标准，导致编辑过程不透明且难以审核。需要新的治理模式来维护科学的完整性。

Method: 通过分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标，证明其可靠性。

Result: 该系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，并且保持坚定不移的程序完整性，为评估AI评审提供了一个稳定、基于证据的标准。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责制的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流的信任提供了关键基础设施。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTabAD通过恢复文本语义来实现上下文感知的表格异常检测研究，弥补了现有基准测试忽略文本元数据的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准测试缺乏语义背景，限制了研究的灵活性，阻碍了模型充分利用领域知识进行检测。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，这些数据集通过结构化文本元数据丰富，以及最先进的AD算法的实现，包括经典、深度学习和基于LLM的方法，以及一个利用语义上下文的zero-shot LLM框架。

Result: 语义上下文提高了检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD是一个用于系统探索上下文感知AD的基准。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

*Xinyuan Song,Keyu Wang,PengXiang Li,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs的深层对表征学习贡献不大，移除后性能下降不明显，但这种说法可能过于片面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究对LLM深度的评估不足，未能涵盖模型行为的各个方面。

Method: 对不同维度（评估协议、任务类别、模型架构）的深度利用率进行了系统研究。

Result: 深层通常不如浅层有效，但其贡献随评估设置而异。基于似然性的指标在没有生成的情况下，修剪大多数层可以保持性能，只有最初的几层至关重要。相反，基于生成的评估揭示了中间层和更深层在实现推理和维持长程连贯性方面不可或缺的作用。知识和检索集中在浅层组件中，而推理准确性严重依赖于更深层，但可以通过蒸馏来重塑。

Conclusion: LLM中的深度使用是高度异构且依赖于上下文的，因此在解释和压缩大型模型时，需要考虑任务、指标和模型感知。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估了模型在 ConceptARC 上的抽象能力，发现仅凭准确率评估可能高估文本模态的能力，低估视觉模态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有模型是否真正理解并运用了 ARC-AGI 基准测试中设计的抽象概念。

Method: 通过改变输入模态（文本 vs. 视觉）、是否允许使用外部 Python 工具以及推理模型的推理强度来评估模型，并细致评估模型生成的自然语言规则。

Result: 结果表明，一些基于文本的模型达到了人类的输出准确率，但其规则通常基于表面层次的“捷径”，未能像人类那样捕捉到预期的抽象概念。在视觉模态下，AI 模型的输出准确率急剧下降，但规则层面的分析表明，模型可能被低估，因为它们仍然表现出相当一部分能够捕捉预期抽象概念的规则，但通常无法正确应用这些规则。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍然落后于人类，并且仅使用准确率来评估 ARC 类任务上的抽象推理可能会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，而低估视觉模态的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户难以在QuintoAndar平台上找到理想的住所，位置在其中起着关键作用，因为它会显著影响房产价值、便利设施的可达性和生活质量。因此，将位置纳入推荐至关重要。

Method: 该方法将分层H3网格以多个级别集成到一个双塔神经架构中。

Result: 嵌入特定评估揭示了更丰富和更平衡的嵌入表示。

Conclusion: 离线排序模拟表明推荐质量得到了显著提升。

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform,
revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it
simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing
accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses
available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this
context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property
value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a
modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into
recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware
embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing
recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an
hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.
We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a
single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding
specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,
while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in
recommendation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠数据源在假新闻和宣传泛滥的时代至关重要，但国家统计机构的数据分散且难以处理，本研究旨在利用LLMs来改善这一状况。

Method: 本研究使用荷兰统计局的公共数据，评估了多个LLMs识别相关数据表、执行必要操作并自主生成适当可视化图表的能力，并提出了一个新的评估框架，包含数据检索与预处理、代码质量和视觉表示三个维度。

Result: 结果表明，定位和处理正确的数据是最重要的挑战。在没有明确指导的情况下，LLMs很少实现可视化最佳实践。当补充了有效图表设计的信息后，模型在表示得分上显示出显着提高。此外，具有迭代自我评估的代理方法在所有评估维度上都表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过适当的脚手架和反馈机制，可以提高LLMs自动生成图表的有效性，并且系统已经可以在三个评估维度上达到必要的准确性。

Abstract: In this time when biased information, deep fakes, and propaganda proliferate,
the accessibility of reliable data sources is more important than ever.
National statistical institutes provide curated data that contain quantitative
information on a wide range of topics. However, that information is typically
spread across many tables and the plain numbers may be arduous to process.
Hence, this open data may be practically inaccessible. We ask the question "Are
current Generative AI models capable of facilitating the identification of the
right data and the fully-automatic creation of charts to provide information in
visual form, corresponding to user queries?". We present a structured
evaluation of recent large language models' (LLMs) capabilities to generate
charts from complex data in response to user queries. Working with diverse
public data from Statistics Netherlands, we assessed multiple LLMs on their
ability to identify relevant data tables, perform necessary manipulations, and
generate appropriate visualizations autonomously. We propose a new evaluation
framework spanning three dimensions: data retrieval & pre-processing, code
quality, and visual representation. Results indicate that locating and
processing the correct data represents the most significant challenge.
Additionally, LLMs rarely implement visualization best practices without
explicit guidance. When supplemented with information about effective chart
design, models showed marked improvement in representation scores. Furthermore,
an agentic approach with iterative self-evaluation led to excellent performance
across all evaluation dimensions. These findings suggest that LLMs'
effectiveness for automated chart generation can be enhanced through
appropriate scaffolding and feedback mechanisms, and that systems can already
reach the necessary accuracy across the three evaluation dimensions.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为MetaSynth的框架，它利用隐式搜索反馈来优化元标题和描述，从而提高点击率和排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化搜索和推荐平台上的元标题和描述仍然具有挑战性，因为缺乏显式标签且搜索排名模型是黑盒环境。

Method: MetaSynth是一个多代理检索增强生成框架，它从排名靠前的结果中构建示例库，并根据产品内容和示例生成候选片段，并通过评估器-生成器循环迭代地改进输出，从而增强相关性、促销力度和合规性。

Result: 在专有的电子商务数据和Amazon Reviews语料库上，MetaSynth优于强大的基线，并且A/B测试表明点击率提高了10.26%，点击量提高了7.51%。

Conclusion: MetaSynth为在黑盒系统中使用隐式信号优化内容提供了一个通用范例。

Abstract: Meta titles and descriptions strongly shape engagement in search and
recommendation platforms, yet optimizing them remains challenging. Search
engine ranking models are black box environments, explicit labels are
unavailable, and feedback such as click-through rate (CTR) arrives only
post-deployment. Existing template, LLM, and retrieval-augmented approaches
either lack diversity, hallucinate attributes, or ignore whether candidate
phrasing has historically succeeded in ranking. This leaves a gap in directly
leveraging implicit signals from observable outcomes. We introduce MetaSynth, a
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation framework that learns from implicit
search feedback. MetaSynth builds an exemplar library from top-ranked results,
generates candidate snippets conditioned on both product content and exemplars,
and iteratively refines outputs via evaluator-generator loops that enforce
relevance, promotional strength, and compliance. On both proprietary e-commerce
data and the Amazon Reviews corpus, MetaSynth outperforms strong baselines
across NDCG, MRR, and rank metrics. Large-scale A/B tests further demonstrate
10.26% CTR and 7.51% clicks. Beyond metadata, this work contributes a general
paradigm for optimizing content in black-box systems using implicit signals.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IoDResearch: A private data-centric Deep Research framework using Internet of Data paradigm for improved retrieval, QA, and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data management struggles with multi-source, heterogeneous data, especially private data, leading to low retrieval efficiency and non-compliance with FAIR principles.

Method: IoDResearch encapsulates resources as FAIR digital objects, refines them into knowledge units/graphs, and uses a multi-agent system for QA and report generation.

Result: IoDResearch outperforms RAG and Deep Research baselines in retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks.

Conclusion: IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of private-data-centric Deep Research, enabling more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-source, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific
data has increasingly exposed the limitations of traditional data management.
Most existing DeepResearch (DR) efforts focus primarily on web search while
overlooking local private data. Consequently, these frameworks exhibit low
retrieval efficiency for private data and fail to comply with the FAIR
principles, ultimately resulting in inefficiency and limited reusability. To
this end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private
data-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data
paradigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant
digital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and
knowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity
retrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both
reliable question answering and structured scientific report generation.
Furthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically
evaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD
scenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show
that IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research
baselines. Overall, IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of
private-data-centric Deep Research under the IoD paradigm, paving the way
toward more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.

*Adithya Rajan,Xiaoyu Liu,Prateek Verma,Vibhu Arora*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种以数据为中心的方法，通过使用合成前缀来减轻实时神经查询自动完成系统中的呈现偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在实时查询自动完成交互中，模型建议会影响用户行为而产生的固有偏差。

Method: 使用在常规搜索会话期间收集的完整用户查询生成合成前缀，从而丰富训练数据，使其包含更多样化和更少偏差的示例。通过利用每个前缀只有一个真实选择的查询自动完成结构，引入了列表损失的任务特定简化，将计算复杂度从$O(n^2)$降低到$O(n)$。

Result: 在一个大型电子商务环境中部署，该系统在用户参与度方面表现出具有统计意义的改进，通过平均倒数排名和相关指标衡量。

Conclusion: 合成前缀不仅提高了泛化能力，而且为其他低延迟排序任务（包括相关搜索和查询推荐）中的偏差缓解提供了一条可扩展的途径。

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为
ame{}的框架，旨在解决现有推荐系统中存在的三个主要问题：无法捕捉快速变化的用户偏好、忽略了物品中丰富的视觉和音频内容、以及缺乏可信的、有证据支持的推荐解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在推荐任务中面临挑战，包括无法捕捉用户偏好变化、忽略物品的多模态信息以及缺乏可信的推荐解释。

Method: 该框架通过三个创新点来解决这些问题：在线适应机制、统一的多模态表示以及基于协同模式和物品属性的解释系统。

Result: 该方法在保持冻结的基础模型效率的同时，只增加了极少的计算开销，使其在实际部署中具有可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地解决现有推荐系统中的问题，并具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强的生成式推荐框架，通过多模态融合、检索增强生成、因果推理去偏、可解释推荐生成和实时自适应学习能力来解决传统生成式推荐系统在处理多模态数据、消除算法偏差和提供透明决策过程方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的生成式推荐系统在处理多模态数据、消除算法偏差和提供透明的决策过程方面面临着巨大的挑战。

Method: 利用先进的大型语言模型作为主干，同时结合专门的模块，用于跨模态理解、上下文知识集成、偏差缓解、解释综合和连续模型适应。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023)上进行的大量实验表明，与现有方法相比，该框架在推荐准确性、公平性和多样性方面都有持续的改进。所提出的框架在NDCG@10上实现了高达2.3%的改进，在多样性指标上实现了1.4%的增强。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个增强的生成式推荐框架，通过多项创新技术，在推荐准确性、公平性和多样性方面都取得了显著的提升。

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于LLM的音乐推荐系统，该系统通过工具调用整合了多种检索和排序方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推荐系统对元数据和属性过滤等简单但关键的组件利用不足。

Method: 使用LLM作为端到端推荐系统，解释用户意图，规划工具调用，并协调布尔过滤器、稀疏检索、密集检索和生成式检索等组件。

Result: 该统一的工具调用框架在各种推荐场景中实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 设想了一种对话式音乐推荐系统的新范例，通过根据用户查询选择性地采用适当的检索方法。

Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have
successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language
interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler
yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in
the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool
calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system
positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user
intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components:
boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding
similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning,
the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the
arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse
modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We
demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive
performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing
appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm
for conversational music recommendation systems.

*Oscar Villemaud,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何从粗粒度的评分中恢复细粒度的项目排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于信息检索和推荐系统中，用户通常只能提供粗粒度的离散评分，而研究如何从这些粗粒度评分中恢复更精确的项目排序。

Method: 该论文将项目建模为具有分数，用户建模为具有阈值；如果项目分数超过用户阈值，则用户对该项目进行正面评价。论文分析了在这种模型下，在分数和阈值都未知的情况下，如何估计项目排序。

Result: 论文证明，要达到接近完美的排序（通过 Spearman 距离衡量），需要 Θ(n^2) 个用户（以及因此 Ω(n^2) 个查询）。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了在线排序中的一个矛盾：阈值多样性对于将来自许多用户的粗略评分合并为细粒度排序是必要的，但如果先验未知阈值，则这种多样性是有代价的。

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender
systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on
a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a
fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as
having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively
if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on
the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores
and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally
partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside
each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can
be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a
near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$
users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than
the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the
additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate
thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score
and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the
tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity
matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in
online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings
from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if
the thresholds are a priori unknown.

### [144] [Contrastive Retrieval Heads Improve Attention-Based Re-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02219)
*Linh Tran,Yulong Li,Radu Florian,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的检索头选择方法（CoRe heads），用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的重排序性能。该方法能够识别并选择少量（<1%）的关键检索头，显著提高重排序准确率，同时还能通过剪枝减少推理时间和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力机制的重排序系统存在大量噪声和冗余的注意力头，限制了性能。

Method: 提出一种对比评分指标，用于选择与相关文档高度相关的注意力头（CoRe heads），同时降低与不相关文档相关的注意力头的权重。

Result: 在三个LLM上的实验表明，CoRe heads能够显著提高重排序准确率，并且主要集中在中间层。剪枝后50%的模型层能够保持准确率，同时降低推理时间和内存占用。

Conclusion: CoRe heads能够有效提升LLM的重排序性能，并具有降低计算成本的潜力。

Abstract: The strong zero-shot and long-context capabilities of recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for highly effective re-ranking systems.
Attention-based re-rankers leverage attention weights from transformer heads to
produce relevance scores, but not all heads are created equally: many
contribute noise and redundancy, thus limiting performance. To address this, we
introduce CoRe heads, a small set of retrieval heads identified via a
contrastive scoring metric that explicitly rewards high attention heads that
correlate with relevant documents, while downplaying nodes with higher
attention that correlate with irrelevant documents. This relative ranking
criterion isolates the most discriminative heads for re-ranking and yields a
state-of-the-art list-wise re-ranker. Extensive experiments with three LLMs
show that aggregated signals from CoRe heads, constituting less than 1% of all
heads, substantially improve re-ranking accuracy over strong baselines. We
further find that CoRe heads are concentrated in middle layers, and pruning the
computation of final 50% of model layers preserves accuracy while significantly
reducing inference time and memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的Promptagator方法依赖于专有的大型LLM，用户可能无法访问或被禁止使用敏感数据。

Method: 研究了可访问规模（≤14B参数）的开源LLM作为替代方案的影响。

Result: 结果表明，小至3B参数的开源LLM可以作为有效的Promptagator风格的查询生成器。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从业者提供了可靠的合成数据生成替代方案，并为最大化领域特定应用的微调结果提供了见解。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

### [146] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的框架，可以在大规模空间合并和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回控制，同时保持较低的方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间合并和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过多的手动审查会增加成本。传统的置信区间截断（如 Clopper-Pearson 或 Wilson）虽然提供了召回率的下限，但通常会超出目标几个百分点，并且在倾斜的分数分布下表现出较高的运行方差。

Method: 该框架首先使用等网格边界框过滤器和压缩稀疏行 (CSR) 候选表示，将配对枚举减少两个数量级。确定性的 xxHash 自举样本训练一个轻量级神经排序器；其分数通过单个前向传递传播到所有剩余对，并用于构建可重现的、按分数十分位数分层的校准集。四种互补的阈值估计器（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson 和精确分位数）通过逆方差加权进行聚合，然后在九个独立的子样本中融合。该集成减少了阈值方差。

Result: 在两个真实的地籍数据集（约 631 万和 6734 万对）上进行评估，该方法始终在小误差范围内达到召回目标，相对于其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个 TPU v3 核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法可以在大规模空间合并和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回控制，同时保持较低的方差，并且可以在单个 TPU v3 核心上端到端运行。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度泛函理论（DFT）方法计算成本高，限制了长期模拟的可行性。

Method: 将MD模拟公式化为时间序列预测问题，通过位移而不是绝对位置预测原子轨迹。结合基于DFT参数化的成对Morse势函数的物理信息损失和推理机制，该函数会惩罚不真实的原子邻近性，以增强物理合理性。

Result: 在各种材料的模拟精度方面，该方法始终优于标准基线。它可以在几分钟内稳定地对数千个MD步骤进行建模。

Conclusion: 结合物理知识对于提高原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度至关重要。该方法为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了一种可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为选择性抽样（selective sampling）的方法，旨在提高语言模型生成结果的多样性，同时保持高精度，特别是在数学推理等任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于温度的采样方法在提高多样性的同时，会降低需要高精度的任务（如数学推理）的准确性，因为在敏感的解码位置采样到错误的延续。

Method: 该方法基于一个采样风险指标，动态地在贪婪采样和高温采样之间切换。通过在可验证问题的小子集上训练一个轻量级分类器来预测采样风险。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性抽样增强了质量-多样性的权衡，即使在高温设置下也是如此。

Conclusion: 选择性抽样是一种有效的方法，可以在提高语言模型生成结果多样性的同时，保持其在需要高精度任务中的准确性。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动工作流程，用于从约 10,000 篇科学文章中提取热电和结构性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏将性能指标与结构背景相结合的大型、机器可读数据集，这限制了材料的快速发现。现有的数据库要么很小，要么是手动管理的，要么偏向于第一性原理的结果，使得实验文献未得到充分利用。

Method: 该流程集成了动态令牌分配、零样本多代理提取和条件表解析，以平衡准确性与计算成本。

Result: 从约 10,000 篇科学文章中提取了 27,822 条温度分辨的属性记录，具有标准化的单位，包括热电优值 (ZT)、塞贝克系数、电导率、电阻率、功率因数和热导率，以及晶体类别、空间群和掺杂策略等结构属性。数据集分析重现了已知的热电趋势。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了迄今为止最大的 LLM 管理的热电数据集，提供了一个可重复且具有成本效益的提取流程，并为热电之外的可扩展、数据驱动的材料发现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一种新的量化框架，旨在提高LLM的极低比特量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量量化方法在低比特量化LLM时面临方向误差不受约束和比特分配不理想的问题。

Method: RSAVQ引入了两种几何驱动的创新：误差方向敏感性引导（EDSG）和权重通道敏感性引导（WCSG）。

Result: 实验表明，RSAVQ优于现有的LLM量化方法。例如，在LLaMA-3 8B的2比特量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度和zero-shot准确率方面均优于VPTQ和QuIP#。

Conclusion: RSAVQ为受限环境提供了一种实用的解决方案，并在信息几何和神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，从而推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

### [151] [Adaptive Federated Learning Defences via Trust-Aware Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01261)

TL;DR: 联邦学习容易受到攻击，我们使用信任感知深度 Q 网络来防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观察的情况下容易受到中毒和后门攻击。

Method: 将防御建模为一个部分可观察的序列决策问题，并引入一个信任感知深度 Q 网络，该网络将多信号证据整合到客户端信任更新中，同时优化长时程鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 上，我们 (i) 建立了一个基线，显示准确率稳步提高，(ii) 通过 Dirichlet 扫描表明，增加客户端重叠始终提高准确率并降低 ASR，同时保持稳定的检测，以及 (iii) 在信号预算研究中表明，随着可观察性的降低，准确率保持稳定，而 ASR 增加，ROC-AUC 下降，这突出表明序列信念更新减轻了较弱的信号。

Conclusion: 与随机、线性 Q 和策略梯度控制器相比，DQN 实现了最佳的鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于预测火车站平均到达延误的 Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确预测列车延误对于高效的铁路运营至关重要，可以改善调度决策。以往的研究主要集中在预测单个列车的准确延误，而最近的研究已经开始探索车站级别的延误预测，以支持更高级别的交通管理。

Method: 该方法结合了多种架构创新和新颖的特征集成，包括列车频率感知空间注意力。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了大型铁路网络中平均延误预测的建模，而且还提供了一个开放数据集，以鼓励对这一关键领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的剪枝方法，称为 Budgeted Broadcast (BB)，它根据单元的流量预算进行剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数剪枝方法都是根据参数对损失的影响来删除参数，而本文提出BB方法，根据长期开启率和扇出的乘积给每个单元一个本地流量预算。

Method: BB方法通过约束熵分析，最大化全局流量预算下的编码熵，实现选择性和受众平衡。BB 使用简单的本地执行器来执行这种平衡，这些执行器可以修剪扇入（以降低活动）或扇出（以减少广播）。

Result: BB 提高了编码熵和去相关性，并在 ASR 的 Transformer、面部识别的 ResNet 和突触预测的 3D U-Net 的匹配稀疏性下提高了准确性，有时甚至超过了密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上，它在我们的评估协议下获得了最先进的 F1 和 PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB 易于集成，并为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条途径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for

### [155] [RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265)
*Ali Hatamizadeh,Syeda Nahida Akter,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Jan Kautz,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLP, a reinforcement pretraining objective that encourages independent thinking in language models by rewarding chain-of-thought reasoning based on information gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions the dominant paradigm of pre-training language models with next-token prediction and using reinforcement learning only in the final post-training phase.

Method: RLP treats chain-of-thought as an exploratory action and computes rewards based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. It measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone.

Result: Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base improves performance by 19% on a math-and-science suite. Applying RLP to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%.

Conclusion: RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. It demonstrates scalability across architectures and model sizes.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合控制框架，该框架集成了线性二次调节器 (LQR) 和强化学习 (RL) 控制器，以解决基于 RL 的振动控制中的训练安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外部激励引起的结构振动存在重大风险，传统的基于模型的控制策略（如线性二次调节器 (LQR)）虽然可以有效地减轻振动，但它们依赖于精确的系统模型，需要繁琐的系统识别。为了避免繁琐的系统识别过程，可以使用无模型的强化学习 (RL) 方法。

Method: 该方法使用 LQR 控制器来指导 RL 控制器。LQR 策略来自随机选择的模型及其参数。这种混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最大限度地降低了朴素 RL 实施中固有的探索风险。

Result: 即使是基于完全不正确的模型的 LQR 控制器也优于不受控的情况。该混合方法解决了基于 RL 的振动控制的关键训练安全挑战，并提供了一个经过验证的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究首次解决了基于 RL 的振动控制的关键训练安全挑战，并提供了一个经过验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的信息理论方法来识别和分析RNN中的信息传递节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进其设计至关重要。

Method: 通过量化节点间输入和输出向量的互信息来确定信息流动的关键路径。

Result: 揭示了不同架构中信息传递的独特模式，并评估了识别节点的功能重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅增强了我们对驱动RNN的复杂机制的理解，而且为设计更强大和可解释的神经网络提供了一个有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的非对比正-无标记 (PU) 学习框架 NcPU，该框架在复杂的据集上优于现有的 PU 学习方法，并且不需要辅助信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有先进的 PU 学习方法在复杂的数据集上明显不如其监督方法，特别是在没有辅助负样本或预估参数的情况下。主要的瓶颈是在不可靠的监督下学习区分性表示的挑战。

Method: NcPU 结合了稳健的噪声对监督非对比损失 (NoiSNCL) 和幻影标签消歧 (PLD) 方案。NoiSNCL 用于对齐类内表示，而 PLD 通过基于后悔的标签更新来提供保守的负监督。

Result: NoiSNCL 使简单的 PU 方法能够实现有竞争力的性能。NcPU 在各种数据集上实现了比现有技术水平的 PU 方法的显着改进，包括灾后建筑物损坏映射方面的具有挑战性的数据集。

Conclusion: NcPU 在实际应用中具有很大的潜力。

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Motivation: 受微 saccades 运动的启发，揭示人类感知的隐藏动态，为大型语言模型 (LLM) 提出了一种类似的探测方法。

Method: 通过轻量级位置编码扰动引发潜在信号，表明模型的不良行为。

Result: 在多个先进的 LLM 上的实验表明，这种基于扰动的探测方法能够发现不良行为，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 预训练的 LLM 已经编码了标记自身失败所需的内部证据，并且受微 saccades 启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了一条途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV：通过压缩关键值（KV）缓存来提高大型推理模型的性能，同时保持近乎无损的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型中的长输出上下文生成会导致关键值（KV）缓存快速增长，从而迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 提出了一种名为ThinKV的自适应KV缓存压缩框架，该框架基于注意力稀疏性揭示的CoT中不同重要性的思想类型，应用混合量化-驱逐策略，并设计了一个扩展的PagedAttention内核以实现高效的内存槽重用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill、GPT-OSS和NVIDIA AceReason等模型上，数学和编码基准测试表明，ThinKV以不到原始KV缓存5%的容量实现了近乎无损的精度，同时将推理吞吐量提高了高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想感知的KV缓存压缩，显著提高了大型推理模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于估计车辆延误的领域自适应（DA）框架，以解决传统机器学习模型在不同交叉口泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的车辆延误估计对于评估信号交叉口的性能和为交通管理策略提供信息至关重要。传统的机器学习模型通常假设训练和测试数据遵循相同的分布，但实际应用中很少满足此假设，导致泛化能力差和模型精度降低。

Method: 该框架将数据分为源域和目标域，提取关键交通特征，并使用来自目标域的小型标记子集对模型进行微调。一种新的DA模型，即具有平衡加权的梯度提升（GBBW），根据与目标域的相似性重新加权源数据，从而提高适应性。

Result: 使用亚利桑那州皮马县57个异构交叉口的数据对该框架进行了测试。结果表明，GBBW框架提供了更准确和稳健的延误估计。

Conclusion: 该方法支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于绩效的规划。通过提高模型的可迁移性，该框架有助于在实际交通运输系统中更广泛地部署机器学习技术。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Motivation: 考虑一个 spiked 数据模型，其中 bulk 可以是各向异性的和病态的，不要求独立的数据和权重矩阵，并且分析了平均场和神经正切核缩放。

Method: 证明了关于输入权重的梯度近似为低秩，并且由两个秩一项控制：一个与 bulk 数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一项 spike 对齐。描述了训练数据、缩放机制和激活函数的属性如何控制这两个分量之间的平衡。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Motivation: 我们正式描述了这种表示的理想特性、它们的统计优势和潜在的不可识别性来源。

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video
data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their
statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action

*Akhlaqur Rahman Sabby,Yi Sui,Tongzi Wu,Jesse C. Cresswell,Ga Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，研究了SSRL算法的学习目标是否决定了其可能的优化策略和模型设计选择，并从 variational mutual information (MI) lower bound 推导出两种训练范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 试图统一SSRL方法，但诸如预测器网络、停止梯度操作和统计正则化器等架构元素通常被视为经验驱动的添加。

Method: 从 variational mutual information (MI) lower bound 出发，推导出两种训练范式，即 Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) 和 Joint MI (JMI)。

Result: SDMI 本质上需要交替优化，使得停止梯度操作在理论上是必不可少的。 相比之下，JMI 允许通过没有此类组件的对称架构进行联合优化。 在所提出的公式下，SDMI 中的预测器网络和 JMI 中的统计正则化器成为 MI 目标的可处理替代。

Conclusion: 本文为现有 SSRL 方法的不同架构组件的选择提供了理论解释，超越了启发式便利。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数据集中各向异性的指标，通过区分原始数据集及其随机增强等效数据集的双样本神经分类器测试来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知机器学习方法（如数据增强和等变架构）旨在提高泛化性和样本效率，但前提是转换后的数据点在测试分布下是高概率的。本文旨在 критически 评估这一假设。

Method: 提出了一种量化数据集中各向异性或对称性破缺程度的指标，该指标基于双样本神经分类器测试，用于区分原始数据集及其随机增强的等效数据集。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了该指标，并发现几个基准点云数据集中存在惊人的高度对齐现象。理论上表明，即使底层标签是真正不变的，分布对称性破缺实际上也会阻止不变方法达到最佳性能。实证研究发现，对称感知方法的影响取决于数据集：等变方法在某些各向异性数据集上仍然有效，但在其他数据集上则不然。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，理解等变性（无论何时起作用以及为什么）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

*Kiwhan Song,Jaeyeon Kim,Sitan Chen,Yilun Du,Sham Kakade,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型通过学习分数函数生成样本，但它们实际上学习的是哪个分数函数仍然是一个问题。本文认为，更好的扩散模型在某些输入空间区域更准确地逼近分数，而在其他区域则欠拟合，这种选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型是生成建模的主要范式，但它们学习的分数函数尚不明确。如果模型完全匹配经验分数，将无法生成新样本。因此，理解扩散模型如何学习分数至关重要。

Method: 通过引入“选择性欠拟合”的概念，即模型在不同区域以不同精度逼近分数，并设计实验验证这一观点。

Result: 结果表明，选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，并为模型的泛化和生成性能提供了新的、可验证的见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型的关键，它影响模型的泛化和生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM，一个轻量级的、模型无关的方法，用于在推理时自我修正掩码扩散模型(MDM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MDM自我修正方法需要改变MDM架构/训练，或者依赖于不精确的token质量代理，限制了它们的适用性。

Method: PRISM定义了一个自我修正损失，可以证明学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数在与MDM相同的正向传递中计算，并用于检测低质量的token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上改进了MDM推理：Sudoku；无条件文本 (170M)；以及使用LLaDA (8B) 的代码。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种轻量级的、模型无关的方法，可以有效地提高MDM的推理性能。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成通常需要在输出质量和推理成本之间取得平衡，尤其是在使用多次生成时。

Method: 开发了UCB风格的潘多拉魔盒算法，并将其调整到实际的LLM设置，通过Bradley-Terry启发的转换来解决跨prompt的奖励缩放问题。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略可以获得与非自适应Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果在最优停止理论和推理时缩放之间建立了一个有原则的桥梁，为LLM的部署提供了理论性能界限和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Motivation: 现有的自由能重构方法（如高斯过程回归（GPR））需要集体变量（CVs）的雅可比矩阵，这限制了复杂或机器学习的CVs的使用。

Method: 该方法使用神经网络代理框架，该框架直接从笛卡尔坐标中学习CVs，并使用自动微分来提供雅可比矩阵。

Result: 在MgCl2离子配对系统上，该方法在简单距离CV和复杂配位数CV上都实现了高精度。此外，雅可比矩阵误差也接近高斯分布，使其适合GPR管道。

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够结合复杂和机器学习的CVs，从而扩大了生物化学和材料模拟的范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的图像压缩与重建框架，可以在保证图像质量的同时，显著降低解码器的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: 提出SoftAdaClip，一种新的差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换代替硬裁剪，以保留相对梯度幅度并限制敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私降低模型性能和公平性，特别是在代表性不足的群体中。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪可能会不成比例地抑制少数亚群的学习信号。自适应裁剪仍然依赖于统一的硬裁剪，这可能会限制公平性。

Method: 用平滑的、基于tanh的转换替换硬裁剪，以保留相对梯度幅度，同时限制敏感性。

Result: 在各种数据集上评估了SoftAdaClip，结果表明，与DP-SGD相比，SoftAdaClip减少了高达87%的亚组差异，与Adaptive-DPSGD相比，减少了高达48%的亚组差异，并且这些亚组差异的减少具有统计学意义。

Conclusion: 将平滑转换与自适应机制相结合对于实现公平和私有的模型训练非常重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Conclusion: SCOPED 是在实际领域中实现快速可靠的 OOD 检测的实用基础。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Motivation: 研究MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)上的表现不如在OpenAI Gym上的问题，揭示了环境特定假设如何隐式编码到算法设计中。

Method: 分析了动力学和奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配，以及目标表示选择不当导致模型方差膨胀的问题。

Conclusion: 希望研究结果能够促使社区开发分类法，将MDP任务和环境级别结构与算法失败模式联系起来，寻求统一的解决方案，并阐明基准选择如何最终影响算法泛化的条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

TL;DR: 本文研究了噪声反馈对偏好优化（一种对齐大型语言模型（LLM）与人类偏好的方法）的影响，并提供了在这种条件下的泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化工作大多假设无噪声反馈，这不符合实际情况，因为人类判断存在误差和不一致。

Method: 本文考虑了对应于常见真实世界噪声源的噪声模型，例如错误标记和不确定性。与假设收敛的传统分析不同，本文侧重于有限步偏好优化，并根据偏好数据分布和样本数量，描述了泛化如何随不同类型的噪声衰减。

Result: 本文对噪声偏好学习的分析适用于广泛的偏好优化损失，如DPO、IPO、SLiC等。在当代LLM上的实证验证证实了本文发现的实际意义。

Conclusion: 本文为开发与人类偏好对齐的AI系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的meta-RLVR算法，名为LSPO，它基于平均响应长度动态选择训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM中的过度思考问题，并提高RLVR的效率和效果。

Method: 提出Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO)算法，该算法基于平均响应长度动态选择训练数据。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上评估了LSPO，表明它可以持续提高学习效果。

Conclusion: 研究了将长度信号纳入动态采样的替代方法，为未来的研究提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 离线到在线强化学习利用离线数据集进行预训练，并进行在线微调，但其效果不稳定。论文提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释这种不一致性，该原则指出，我们应该在在线微调期间保留预训练策略或离线数据集的知识，同时保持足够的可塑性。该框架确定了在线微调的三个阶段，每个阶段都需要不同的稳定性。通过大规模实证研究验证了这个框架，结果与 63 个案例中的 45 个案例的预测高度一致。这项工作为指导离线到在线强化学习中的设计选择提供了一个原则性框架，基于离线数据集和预训练策略的相对性能。

Result: 大规模实证研究验证了这个框架，结果与 63 个案例中的 45 个案例的预测高度一致

Conclusion: 为指导离线到在线强化学习中的设计选择提供了一个原则性框架

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，用于解决高维黑盒优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高斯过程在高维不规则变量问题上表现不佳，而神经网络可以作为替代。

Method: 该方法采用LLM作为代理模型，并利用LoRA进行微调，结合VBLL框架。同时，采用加权集成方法自动选择LoRA秩和其他超参数。

Result: 在各种高维基准和实际分子优化任务上的大量实验结果表明，所提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法具有令人信服的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在解决高维黑盒优化问题上具有良好的性能。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法PEL-NAS，旨在解决现有方法搜索效率低和探索偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于超网络的方法需要大量的GPU资源和时间，而基于LLM的方法存在探索偏差，难以在整个搜索空间中发现不同延迟范围的架构。

Method: PEL-NAS包含三个关键组件：1) 复杂性驱动的搜索空间划分引擎，用于增强多样性并减轻探索偏差；2) LLM驱动的架构提示共同进化算子，利用LLM更新设计启发式的知识库，并基于此进行引导式架构进化；3) 零成本预测器，避免从头开始训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，并且在相似的精度下，延迟比基线方法降低了高达54%。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS能够在降低搜索成本的同时，生成具有高精度和低延迟的神经网络。与传统的超网络基线相比，搜索成本从几天降低到几分钟。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

*Shriram Karpoora Sundara Pandian,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的离线强化学习方法，通过密度比加权的行为克隆来应对受污染的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习容易受到对抗性攻击、系统误差或低质量样本的影响，导致策略性能下降。

Method: 引入密度比加权行为克隆（Weighted BC），使用干净的参考集来估计轨迹级别的密度比，并将其用作BC目标中的权重，以优先考虑干净的专家行为。

Result: 理论保证表明，该方法可以收敛到干净的专家策略，且有限样本边界与污染率无关。实验表明，即使在高污染率下，Weighted BC也能保持接近最优的性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC 是一种有效的离线强化学习方法，对受污染的数据集具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对抗样本可以在图像分类器和语言模型之间转移，但最近的研究表明，图像jailbreak在视觉-语言模型之间不能成功转移。本文提出了一种解释这种差异的假设，并提供了理论和实验证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像jailbreak在视觉-语言模型之间不能成功转移

Method: 1. 数学上证明了在两个网络计算相同的输入-输出映射但通过不同的表示的情况下，数据空间攻击可以转移，而表征空间攻击不能转移。2. 构建针对图像分类器的表征空间攻击，证明其无法转移。3. 构建针对语言模型的表征空间攻击，证明其无法转移。4. 构建针对视觉-语言模型的数据空间攻击，证明其可以转移，并且当视觉-语言模型的潜在几何结构在后投影空间中充分对齐时，表征空间攻击可以转移。

Result: 1. 证明了数据空间攻击可以转移，而表征空间攻击不能转移。2. 构造的表征空间攻击无法转移。3. 数据空间攻击可以成功转移到新的视觉-语言模型。4. 当视觉-语言模型的潜在几何结构在后投影空间中充分对齐时，表征空间攻击可以转移。

Conclusion: 对抗转移不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特的表征空间。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了实际的性能提升和概念上的见解，为设计稳健的多代理LLM管道提供了帮助。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Conclusion: 动作空间设计在强化学习的临床应用中至关重要，它既能提高治疗效果，又能保证决策的合理性和可解释性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

TL;DR: 本文研究了知识图谱上的零样本链接预测问题，并提出了一种新的概率节点关系等变性方法，以提高模型的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱基础模型在处理结构相似但语义不同的关系时存在局限性，因为它们强制执行确定性等变性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Flock的知识图谱基础模型，该模型通过迭代采样随机游走，并结合概率节点关系等变性来实现。

Result: Flock在Petals数据集上表现完美，并在54个知识图谱的实体和关系预测任务上取得了最好的效果。

Conclusion: Flock模型能够有效解决零样本链接预测问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.
