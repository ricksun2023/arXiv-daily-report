TL;DR: use LLMs to add metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability in dialogue transcription pipelines


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability in dialogue transcription pipelines

Method: coupling frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations

Result: achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed

Conclusion: A frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

### [2] [Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796)
*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parity-aware BPE 是一种新的分词算法，它可以提高低资源语言的 tokenization 质量，而不会降低高资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的分词算法依赖于基于频率的目标，这使得在训练数据中占主导地位的语言受益，并导致低资源语言的分词不成比例地更长，形态上不合理，甚至充斥着 <UNK> 占位符。这种现象最终加剧了来自不同语言背景的用户之间的计算和经济不平等。

Method: 引入 Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)，这是一种广泛使用的 BPE 算法的变体。在每个合并步骤中，Parity-aware BPE 最大化当前压缩率最差的语言的压缩增益，从而以少量全局压缩为代价来实现跨语言的均等性。

Result: Parity-aware BPE 可以在不同语言之间产生更公平的 token 计数，对全局压缩率的影响可以忽略不计，并且对下游任务中语言模型的性能没有实质性影响。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE 可以在保证全局压缩率和下游任务中语言模型性能基本不变的情况下，实现更公平的跨语言 token 数量。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

### [3] [Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04814)
*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过联合训练ASR和音调重音检测模型，可以显着提高ASR性能和音调重音检测水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展预训练的语音模型以保留或重新学习重要的韵律线索（如音调重音）非常重要。

Method: 引入联合ASR和音调重音检测模型

Result: 音调重音检测组件使该任务的F1得分差距缩小了41％，在资源有限的微调下，联合训练中的ASR性能使LibriSpeech的WER降低了28.3％。

Conclusion: ASR性能可以通过引入联合ASR和音调重音检测模型来提高。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在性格上不稳定，这使得基于性格的对齐策略可能不适合安全关键型应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要一致的行为模式才能安全部署，但其类似性格的特征仍然知之甚少。

Method: 使用传统和新颖的LLM调整的性格工具，系统地改变问题顺序、释义、角色和推理模式，对25+开源模型（1B-671B参数）在500,000+个响应中进行测试。

Result: 即使是400B+的模型也表现出很大的响应可变性；仅仅是轻微的提示重新排序就会使性格测量值最多改变20%；旨在稳定行为的干预措施，如思维链推理、详细的角色指令、包含对话历史记录，反而会增加可变性；LLM调整的工具显示出与以人为中心的版本相同的不稳定性，证实了架构而非翻译的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型缺乏行为一致性的基础，对于需要可预测行为的安全关键型应用，基于性格的对齐策略可能根本上不适合。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCR-Router是一种用于多代理LLM的高效上下文路由框架，它通过动态选择相关记忆子集并减少令牌使用来提高答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多代理LLM系统中的协调方案依赖于静态或完全上下文路由策略，导致过多的令牌消耗、冗余的记忆暴露以及在交互轮次中有限的适应性。

Method: RCR-Router，一种模块化和角色感知的上下文路由框架，它基于角色和任务阶段为每个代理动态选择语义相关的记忆子集，同时遵守严格的令牌预算。采用轻量级评分策略指导记忆选择，并将代理输出迭代集成到共享记忆存储中，以促进渐进式上下文改进。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试（HotPotQA、MuSiQue和2WikiMultihop）上的实验表明，RCR-Router减少了令牌使用量（高达30%），同时提高或保持了答案质量。

Conclusion: RCR-Router通过结构化记忆路由和输出感知评估，在提升可扩展性的多代理LLM系统中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate demographic bias in LLMs based on subtle linguistic markers. The results show that LLMs penalize certain linguistic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender, social class, or regional background.

Method: Through carefully constructed interview simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of demographic bias in automated evaluation systems.

Result: hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model-specific biases.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundational framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [7] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉活动识别系统评估方法，该方法通过构建动词语义簇来解决传统评估方法中存在的歧义问题，并且更符合人类的判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动词语义和图像解释中固有的歧义，评估视觉活动识别系统具有挑战性。标准的精确匹配评估方法无法捕捉这些歧义，导致模型性能评估不完整。

Method: 提出了一种视觉-语言聚类框架，构建动词语义簇。

Result: 每个图像平均映射到2.8个语义簇，每个簇代表图像的不同视角。聚类评估与人类判断更吻合。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉-语言聚类的框架，用于构建动词语义簇，从而实现更鲁棒的评估。对imSitu数据集的分析表明，每个图像平均映射到2.8个语义簇，每个簇代表图像的不同视角。将聚类评估与标准评估方法进行比较，并通过人工比对分析表明，聚类评估与人类判断更吻合。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段大型语言模型框架，以增强从非结构化文本中提取 SDoH 因素的准确性和透明度，以支持尽早识别高危人群并为更有效的预防策略提供信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解导致自杀事件的健康社会决定因素 (SDoH) 对于早期干预和预防至关重要。 然而，以数据驱动的方式来实现这一目标面临着诸如长尾因素分布、分析自杀事件之前的关键压力源以及模型可解释性有限等挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一个多阶段大型语言模型框架，以增强从非结构化文本中提取 SDoH 因素。

Result: 我们表明，我们提出的框架在提取 SDoH 因素的总体任务以及检索相关上下文的更精细任务中都表现出性能提升。 此外，我们表明，微调一个较小的、特定于任务的模型可以实现相当或更好的性能，同时降低推理成本。 多阶段设计不仅增强了提取，还提供了中间解释，从而提高了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取与自杀相关的 SDoH 的准确性和透明度。 这些进步有可能支持尽早识别高危人群，并为更有效的预防策略提供信息。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [9] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) that partitions dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using structural entropy minimization and then extracts quadruples in two steps. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods learn word relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment elements, but dialogues often contain multiple semantically independent sub-dialogues, introducing noise.

Method: A structural entropy minimization algorithm is used to partition dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues. A two-step framework extracts sentiment elements at the utterance level and then matches quadruples at the sub-dialogue level.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with lower computational costs.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

TL;DR: 通过直接微调LLM，可以在AMR解析上获得与SOTA相当的性能，LLaMA 3.2表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索直接微调解码器专用大型语言模型（LLM）在AMR解析中的应用，这代表了一种有前景的新方向。

Method: 通过微调Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2和DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled四种不同的LLM架构，使用LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0测试集进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，直接微调解码器专用LLM可以达到与复杂的当前最佳AMR解析器相当的性能。LLaMA 3.2在语义性能上领先，而Phi 3.5在结构有效性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: LLaMA 3.2通过直接微调，在AMR解析方面表现出与当前最佳水平相当的竞争力，在LDC2020T02测试集上实现了0.804的SMATCH F1值。

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-LoRA通过对齐任务表示，为多任务LLM适配建立了一个更简单有效的范例，挑战了依赖结构多样性的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）通常需要处理来自多个领域的各种任务，这种情况自然可以通过多任务学习（MTL）来解决。在MTL环境中，一个普遍的趋势是使用具有多个适配器或头的LoRA变体，它们提倡结构多样性来捕获特定于任务的知识。

Method: 提出了Align-LoRA，它包含一个显式的损失，以对齐共享适配器空间内的任务表示。

Result: 一个简化的具有高头间相似性的多头架构大大优于复杂的多适配器和多头系统。标准的单适配器LoRA，如果秩充分增加，也能实现极具竞争力的性能。Align-LoRA显著超越了所有基线。

Conclusion: Align-LoRA通过在共享适配器空间内对齐任务表示，显著超越了所有基线，从而为将LLM适配到多个任务建立了一个更简单但更有效的范例。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

TL;DR: MultiCheck, a multimodal fact-checking framework, outperforms baselines on the Factify 2 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems that rely primarily on textual evidence.

Method: A unified framework called MultiCheck combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion module and a classification head, supported by a contrastive learning objective.

Result: Achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.84 on the Factify 2 dataset, substantially outperforming the baseline.

Conclusion: The MultiCheck framework demonstrates effective multimodal reasoning, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84 on the Factify 2 dataset, outperforming the baseline and showing potential for scalable and interpretable fact-checking.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BEE-RAG, a framework that improves RAG performance by addressing entropy growth and attention dilution issues in long retrieval contexts. It uses balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics and includes a zero-shot inference strategy and adaptive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG tends to operate with long context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval context as significant factors affecting RAG performance.

Method: propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal balancing factor for different settings.

Result: BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型更关注开头和结尾的信息。AttnRank 通过重新排序输入信息来提升模型性能，无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)的性能对输入中信息的上下文位置非常敏感。为了研究这种位置偏差背后的机制，我们的广泛实验揭示了一个一致的现象，我们称之为注意力盆地：当呈现一系列结构化项目(例如，检索到的文档或少样本示例)时，模型系统地将更高的注意力分配给序列开头和结尾的项目，而忽略中间的项目。至关重要的是，我们的分析进一步表明，将更高的注意力分配给关键信息是提高模型性能的关键。

Method: 提出了Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank)，这是一个两阶段框架，(i)使用小校准集估计模型的固有位置注意力偏好，以及(ii)重新排序检索到的文档或少样本示例，以将最显着的内容与这些高注意力位置对齐。

Result: AttnRank是一种模型无关、免训练和即插即用的方法，计算开销极小。在多跳问答和少样本上下文学习任务上的实验表明，AttnRank在各种架构和规模的10个大型语言模型中取得了显著的改进，无需修改模型参数或训练程序。

Conclusion: AttnRank在多跳问答和少样本上下文学习任务中取得了显著的改进，适用于各种架构和规模的10个大型语言模型，无需修改模型参数或训练程序。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

TL;DR: PrinciplismQA是一个用于评估大型语言模型在医疗伦理方面表现的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型语言模型整合到医疗保健中，需要对其伦理推理进行严格评估，而当前基准通常会忽略这一领域。

Method: 引入PrinciplismQA，这是一个综合基准，包含3,648个问题，旨在系统地评估LLM与核心医学伦理的一致性。我们的基准基于Princi主义，具有高质量的数据集。这包括从权威教科书中策划的多项选择题和来自权威医学伦理案例研究文献的开放式问题，所有这些都经过医学专家的验证。

Result: 实验表明，模型在伦理知识和实际应用之间存在显著差距，尤其是在将伦理原则动态应用于现实场景时。大多数LLM都在与“行善”相关的困境中挣扎，通常过分强调其他原则。由强大的通用能力驱动的前沿封闭源模型目前处于领先地位。值得注意的是，医学领域微调可以增强模型的整体伦理能力，但进一步的进展需要与医学伦理知识更好地结合。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于诊断这些特定的伦理弱点，为更平衡和负责任的医疗人工智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Result: 在四个数据集上的大量实验表明，MulCoT-RD在JMSRC上取得了强大的性能。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD模型在仅有3B参数的情况下，在JMSRC上表现出色，同时展现出强大的泛化能力和增强的可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

TL;DR: propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs to enable efficient model pruning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structured pruning methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.

Method: propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs

Result: enable efficient model pruning

Conclusion: The proposed method can successfully identify and locate functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality coding instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale, while code snippets are abundantly available, presenting a bottleneck in instruction-based post-training.

Method: CodeBoost introduces maximum-clique curation, bi-directional prediction, error-aware prediction, heterogeneous augmentation, and heterogeneous rewarding.

Result: CodeBoost consistently improves performance across several code LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeBoost consistently improves performance across several code LLMs and benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

### [20] [ASCoT: An Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought Method for Late-Stage Fragility in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05282)
*Dongxu Zhang,Ning Yang,Jihua Zhu,Jinnan Yang,Miao Xin,Baoliang Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper finds that errors in later stages of Chain-of-Thought reasoning are more detrimental than early errors, and introduces ASCoT to address this Late-Stage Fragility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held cascading failure hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption.

Method: Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE).

Result: Errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT.

Conclusion: ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers, addressing data scarcity by generating synthetic data with LLMs and demonstrating improved efficiency in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing them within a broader context. Dialogue agents can effectively assist decision-makers in such scenarios.

Method: The authors generate synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed method produces higher-quality synthetic data, and the trained dialogue agents outperform off-the-shelf LLM-based assistants and enhance the efficiency of meta-reviewing in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of dialogue agents in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM achieves competitive generation quality across model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGRS mitigates overthinking in LRLMs by suppressing reflection triggers based on model confidence, reducing token usage without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) suffer from overthinking, leading to redundant reasoning steps, increased token usage, and higher inference costs.

Method: Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS): dynamically suppresses reflection triggers based on model confidence.

Result: CGRS reduces token usage by 18.5% to 41.9% on average while preserving accuracy across AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D benchmarks. It outperforms baselines in balancing length reduction and performance.

Conclusion: Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS) effectively reduces token usage while preserving accuracy across various models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本论文调查了在Microsoft Hololens 2设备上向现有手语（SL）化身添加调整功能的影响。

Method: 通过对专家德国手语（DGS）用户在特定用例中与可调节和不可调节化身的互动进行详细分析

Result: 尽管用户偏爱可调整的设置，但未观察到用户体验或可理解性的显着改善，由于缺少SL元素（口型和面部表情）和实施问题（不清楚的手形，缺乏反馈和菜单位置），用户体验或可理解性仍然处于较低水平。 享乐品质高于实用品质，表明用户发现该系统在情感或美学上比功能上有用。 可调化身的压力水平较高，反映出较低的性能，更大的努力和更多的挫败感。 此外，人们还担心Hololens的调整手势是否直观且易于熟悉。 虽然对可调性的概念的接受度总体上是积极的，但它在很大程度上取决于可用性和动画质量。

Conclusion: 个性化本身是不够的，SL化身必须默认是可理解的。 主要建议包括加强口型和面部动画，改进交互界面，以及应用参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Motivation: Agentic RAG和“深度研究”系统旨在实现自主搜索过程，其中大型语言模型（LLM）迭代地改进输出。然而，将这些系统应用于特定领域的专业搜索（如生物医学研究）提出了挑战，因为自动化系统可能会减少用户参与，并与专家的信息需求不符。专业搜索任务通常需要高水平的用户专业知识和透明度。

Method: 一种关键的方法是自我反馈机制，LLM生成、评估和改进他们的输出，用于查询扩展和多种答案类型（是/否、事实型、列表、理想）。

Result: 我们研究了当前推理和非推理LLM（如Gemini-Flash 2.0、o3-mini、o4-mini和DeepSeek-R1）的性能。我们调查了这种迭代的自我修正是否能提高性能，以及推理模型是否更能够生成有用的反馈。

Conclusion: 初步结果表明，不同模型和任务的自我反馈策略表现各异。这项工作提供了对LLM自我修正的见解，并为未来比较LLM生成的反馈与人类专家在这些搜索系统中直接输入的有效性提供了信息。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）通常表现出文化偏见，这是由于训练数据主要由英语和中文等高资源语言主导。这给准确表示和评估不同的文化背景带来了挑战，尤其是在低资源语言环境中。

Method: 引入MyCulture，这是一个旨在全面评估马来西亚文化的基准，涵盖六个支柱：艺术、服装、习俗、娱乐、食物和宗教，以马来语呈现。采用了一种新颖的开放式多项选择题形式，没有预定义的选项，从而减少了猜测并减轻了格式偏差。

Result: 我们对结构偏差进行了分析，通过比较模型在结构化输出与自由形式输出方面的性能，并通过多语言提示变体评估了语言偏差。

Conclusion: 评估各种区域和国际LLM揭示了文化理解方面的显着差异，突显了在LLM的开发和评估中对具有文化基础和语言包容性的基准的迫切需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Method: LLMEval-3 建立在 22 万个研究生级别问题的专有库之上，从中为每次评估运行动态采样未见过的测试集。其自动化管道通过抗污染数据管理、一种新颖的反作弊架构以及与人类专家达成 90% 一致的校准 LLM 作为评判过程来确保完整性，并辅以用于公平比较的相对排名系统。

Result: 一项对近 50 个领先模型进行的为期 20 个月的纵向研究揭示了知识记忆的性能上限，并揭示了静态基准无法检测到的数据污染漏洞。该框架在排名稳定性和一致性方面表现出卓越的稳健性，为动态评估范例提供了强有力的实证验证。

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 提供了一种稳健且可信的方法来评估 LLM 的真实能力，超越了排行榜分数，并促进了更值得信赖的评估标准的开发。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

*Chenzhuo Zhao,Xinda Wang,Yue Huang,Junting Lu,Ziqian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASE benchmark shows LLMs are not good at token-level reasoning compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with fine-grained, token-level understanding and structural reasoning, which are essential for applications requiring precision and control.

Method: A comprehensive benchmark named TASE is introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and reason about token-level information across languages. A custom Qwen2.5-14B model is trained using the GRPO training method.

Result: Human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent weaknesses in token-level reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs are weak in token-level reasoning compared to human performance, which limits low-level language understanding and cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

TL;DR: 现有的创造力评估指标在不同领域表现不一致且有局限性，需要更强大的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在衡量不同创造领域的创造力，包括创意写作、非常规问题解决和研究构思

Method: 系统地检查、分析和比较有代表性的创造力评估指标

Result: 这些指标表现出有限的一致性，捕捉了创造力的不同维度；强调了关键的局限性，包括创造力指数侧重于词汇多样性，困惑度对模型置信度敏感，句法模板无法捕捉概念性创造力，以及LLM-as-a-Judge表现出不稳定性和偏差

Conclusion: 现有创造力评估指标（包括创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge）在不同创造性领域表现出有限的一致性，并且存在诸如创造力指数侧重于词汇多样性、困惑度对模型置信度敏感、句法模板无法捕捉概念性创造力以及LLM-as-a-Judge不稳定和偏见等局限性。因此，需要更强大、更通用的评估框架，以便更好地与人类对创造力的判断相一致。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAG, inspired by Cartesian principles, improves LLM reasoning by decomposing questions, using dependency-aware reasoning, and incorporating a logical termination mechanism to reduce hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations. RAG struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization.

Method: LAG decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies, resolves these sequentially using prior answers to guide context retrieval, incorporates a logical termination mechanism, and synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness and reduces hallucination.

Conclusion: LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM在演绎Global North和Global West的实体方面比Global South和Global East更成功，这表明LLM中存在地理和文化差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）已被广泛调整以减轻明显的偏见，但它们通常表现出植根于其预训练数据中的微妙的隐性偏见。与其直接用可能触发防护措施的人工制作的问题来探测LLM，不如研究模型在主动提问时的行为方式。

Method: 使用一个新数据集Geo20Q+，该数据集包含来自不同地区的著名人物和具有文化意义的物品，系统地评估实体演绎中的地理性能差异。在两种游戏配置（规范的20个问题和无限制的回合）和七种语言中测试流行的LLM。

Result: LLM在演绎Global North的实体方面比Global South更成功，在演绎Global West的实体方面比Global East更成功。Wikipedia的页面浏览量和预训练语料库频率与性能略有相关，但它们未能完全解释这些差异。语言对性能差距的影响很小。

Conclusion: LLMs在演绎Global North和Global West的实体方面比Global South和Global East更成功。语言对性能差距的影响很小。研究结果表明，创造性的自由形式评估框架对于揭示LLM中隐藏的微妙偏差的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的解码策略CoCoLex，通过置信度引导的复制，提高法律文本生成的保真度，并在多个法律基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）由于其处理长而复杂上下文的能力，可以为法律领域提供关键优势，但由于它们倾向于生成不忠实、无根据或虚幻的输出，因此它们的采用受到阻碍。虽然检索增强生成通过将生成建立在外部知识的基础上提供了一个有希望的解决方案，但它不能保证所提供的上下文将被有效地整合。为了解决这个问题，已经提出了上下文感知解码策略来放大相关上下文的影响，但它们通常不会明确地强制要求对上下文的忠实性。

Method: 引入了一种名为“用于法律文本生成的置信度引导的基于复制的解码（CoCoLex）”的解码策略，该策略动态地将模型生成的词汇分布与基于从上下文中复制而来的分布进行插值。CoCoLex鼓励基于模型置信度的直接复制，从而确保更高的源保真度。

Result: CoCoLex优于现有的上下文感知解码方法，尤其是在长格式生成任务中。

Conclusion: CoCoLex在五个法律基准测试中优于现有的上下文感知解码方法，尤其是在长格式生成任务中。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

TL;DR: Frequency-based uncertainty quantification method is proposed to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have inherent unreliability, such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk domains. To address this.

Method: propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy (PE).

Result: frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型在西方语言环境中政治观点可以跨语言迁移，政治对齐会统一改变所有语言的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众意见调查显示，不同社会文化背景下的政治观点存在跨文化差异。然而，目前尚无明确证据表明这些差异是否会转化为多语言大语言模型 (MLLM) 中的跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示多语言大语言模型报告它们对投票建议应用中政治声明的（不）同意程度来评估它们的观点。为了更好地理解模型中语言之间的相互作用，我们在仅使用直接偏好优化和英语对齐数据对齐模型之前和之后都对其进行了评估。

Result: 未对齐的模型在它们反映的政治观点中仅显示出非常少的显着跨语言差异。政治对齐几乎统一地改变了所有五种语言的观点。

Conclusion: 政治观点在西方语言环境中可以跨语言迁移，这表明在实现多语言大语言模型的社会语言、文化和政治对齐方面存在挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith是一种用于合成具有挑战性的数学问题的新框架，以增强LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理方面取得了显著进展，但其进步受到高质量、高难度训练数据稀缺的限制。现有的合成方法主要依赖于转换人工编写的模板，限制了多样性和可扩展性。

Method: MathSmith通过从PlanetMath随机抽样概念-解释对从头开始构建新的数学问题，确保数据的独立性并避免污染。为了增加难度，我们在原理中设计了九个预定义的策略作为软约束。我们进一步采用强化学习来共同优化结构有效性、推理复杂性和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试（分为简单和中等（GSM8K，MATH-500）和困难（AIME2024，AIME2025，OlympiadBench））上的实验表明，在短CoT和长CoT设置下，MathSmith始终优于现有的基线。此外，一个以弱点为中心的变体生成模块能够有针对性地改进特定概念。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了强大的可扩展性、泛化性和可迁移性，突出了高难度合成数据在提升LLM推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cooper, a reinforcement learning framework that co-optimizes the policy model and reward model to address the limitations of rule-based and model-based rewards. It alleviates reward hacking and improves end-to-end RL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking.  To address these issues, we propose Cooper, a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model.

Method: We propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample pairs for continued training the reward model. We also propose a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper.

Result: Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

Conclusion: Dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking, providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored.

Method: OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks through text-based environment representation, modeling continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains.

Result: Systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations.

Conclusion: Embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel reward function for online RL that considers factual precision, response detail, and relevance to improve the factuality of reasoning large language models. The results show a significant reduction in hallucinations and an increase in detail level without sacrificing helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods.

Method: a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning

Result: Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, the factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Conclusion: The factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

*Brandon Jaipersaud,David Krueger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probes can be used to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. They capture various aspects of persuasion and can outperform prompting in some settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs persuade humans is limited. Recent work has used linear probes to study various LLM skills. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations.

Method: Probes are trained on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.

Result: Probes capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. Probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. Probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy.

Conclusion: Probes are a plausible avenue for studying complex behaviors such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

TL;DR: H-NET++: a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words span many bytes

Method: a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training

Result: achieves state-of-the-art results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries

Conclusion: hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

### [42] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual 是一种用于广义 UHD IR 任务的基于 Retinex 理论的新框架，它优于最新的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法，例如极端降采样或从空间域到频域的转换，会遇到明显的缺点：降采样会导致 UHD 图像中不可逆的信息丢失，而我们的频率分析表明，纯频域方法对于空间受限的图像伪影无效，这主要是由于退化局部性的丧失。

Method: RetinexDual：一种基于 Retinex 理论的新颖框架，专为广义 UHD IR 任务而设计。RetinexDual 利用两个互补的子网络：Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) 和 Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA)。

Result: RetinexDual 在质量和数量上均优于最新的方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual 在四个 UHD IR 任务（即去雨、去模糊、去雾和弱光图像增强 (LLIE)）上的评估表明，它在质量和数量上均优于最近的方法。消融研究表明，在 RetinexDual 中为每个分支采用不同设计的重要性，以及其各种组件的有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

TL;DR: Introduces ENTRep, a new benchmark dataset for ENT endoscopy analysis with fine-grained anatomical classification and image/text retrieval in English and Vietnamese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery in ENT care is critical but underdeveloped due to variability in devices/operators, subtle findings, and fine-grained distinctions. Clinicians need reliable retrieval of similar cases, visually and through textual descriptions, which are rarely supported by existing benchmarks.

Method: The paper introduces a dataset with expert-annotated images labeled for anatomical region and normal/abnormal status, accompanied by dual-language narrative descriptions. It defines three benchmark tasks and standardizes the submission protocol.

Result: The paper reports results from the top-performing teams and provides an insight discussion.

Conclusion: The paper introduces ENTRep, a new benchmark dataset for ENT endoscopy analysis, and evaluates the performance of top-performing teams on three benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD is a lightweight framework for distilling knowledge from multiple self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning paradigms are pretrained in isolation and yield large models impractical for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network. It applies asymmetric masking and fuses teacher embeddings through joint consensus gating. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence.

Result: CoMAD achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and MS-COCO with a compact ViT-Tiny model.

Conclusion: CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4 percent Top-1 on ImageNet-1K, 47.3 percent mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL distillation.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

TL;DR: RADAR: Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time, overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection and improves both detection accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive; (2) the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging.

Method: Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model

Result: RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model.

Conclusion: RADAR surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately tracking eye movements during specific events is challenging due to the rapid movements of human eyes. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. The ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm to predict human attention, thereby improving device comfort and enhancing overall user experience.

Method: developed an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using deep learning methods, specifically a CNN_LSTM model

Result: The CNN_LSTM model achieved approximately 81% accuracy in locating the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an event camera.

Conclusion: The CNN_LSTM model was most effective, achieving approximately 81% accuracy. Future work focuses on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the model's interpretability and predictive performance.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

TL;DR: LuKAN, a KAN-based model with Lucas polynomials, predicts 3D human motion efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D human motion prediction often struggle to balance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: The LuKAN model uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations. It includes discrete wavelet transform, a spatial projection layer, and a Temporal Dependency Learner.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets show the model's competitive performance, supported by quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The model's architecture and Lucas polynomials contribute to computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The LuKAN model achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个新的基准，用于评估MLLM在识别和推理细微视觉线索方面的能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准主要分为两种主要类型：基本感知基准，侧重于局部细节但缺乏深入的推理（例如，“图像中有什么？”）；以及主流推理基准，侧重于突出的图像元素，但可能无法评估需要复杂分析的微妙线索。然而，深刻的视觉理解和复杂的推理更多地依赖于解释微妙的、不显眼的局部细节，而不是感知显著的、宏观层面的对象。

Method: 引入VER-Bench，这是一个新的框架，用于评估MLLM的能力：1）识别细粒度的视觉线索，通常平均只占图像面积的0.25%；2）将这些线索与世界知识相结合，进行复杂的推理。

Result: VER-Bench包含374个精心设计的问题，涵盖地理空间、时间、情境、意图、系统状态和符号推理，VER-Bench中的每个问题都附有结构化的证据：视觉线索和从中得出的与问题相关的推理。

Conclusion: VER-Bench揭示了当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的论证方面的局限性，强调需要提高模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Result: highlights the degree of semantic overlap and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations.

Conclusion: Time-stamp noise fundamentally alters model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech expression.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频精彩片段检测方法虽然先进，但难以很好地推广到所有测试视频。这些方法通常为每个测试视频采用通用的精彩片段检测模型，这是次优的，因为它没有考虑到各个测试视频的独特特征和变化。这种固定模型无法适应新的、未见过的测试视频中存在的多样化内容、风格或音频和视觉质量，从而导致精彩片段检测性能下降。

Method: 我们提出了 Highlight-TTA，这是一个用于视频精彩片段检测的测试时自适应框架，通过在测试期间动态调整模型以更好地与每个测试视频的特定特征对齐，从而解决了这一限制，从而提高了泛化和精彩片段检测性能。Highlight-TTA 与辅助任务、跨模态幻觉共同优化，以及主要的突出显示检测任务。我们利用元辅助训练方案，通过辅助任务实现有效的适应，同时增强主要任务。在测试期间，我们使用测试视频上的辅助任务来调整训练后的模型，以进一步提高其突出显示检测性能。

Result: 将 Highlight-TTA 引入到这些模型中可以提高它们的性能，从而产生卓越的结果。

Conclusion: 在三个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，将 Highlight-TTA 引入这些模型可以提高它们的性能，从而产生卓越的结果。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计器对相机校准的变化敏感，导致深度估计错误。

Method: 该方法通过校准tokens调整潜在嵌入来实现对齐。

Result: 该方法可以使用单个tokens集合持续改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在室内和室外均优于现有技术水平。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate

Method: ProMIM，一个即插即用框架，通过将掩码图像建模(MIM)集成到现有的VLM管道中来增强条件提示学习。利用一种简单而有效的掩蔽策略来生成鲁棒的、实例条件的提示，无缝地增强像CoOp和CoCoOp这样的方法，而无需改变它们的核心架构。

Result: ProMIM改进了特征鲁棒性，减轻了过度拟合，同时引入了可以忽略不计的额外计算成本。在零样本和少样本分类任务中的大量实验表明，当ProMIM插入到现有方法中时，始终提高泛化性能。

Conclusion: ProMIM通过结合掩码图像建模(MIM)增强了条件提示学习，在零样本和少样本分类任务中始终提高泛化性能，为实际视觉语言应用提供了一种实用的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间增强的关系感知知识转移(TRKT)方法，在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WS-DSGG方法依赖于现成的外部对象检测器来为后续的DSGG训练生成伪标签。然而，在静态的、以对象为中心的图像上训练的检测器在DSGG所需的动态的、关系感知的场景中表现不佳，导致不准确的定位和低置信度的建议。

Method: 时间增强的关系感知知识转移(TRKT)方法，它利用知识来增强关系感知动态场景中的检测。TRKT建立在两个关键组件之上:(1)关系感知知识挖掘:我们首先使用对象和关系类解码器生成特定于类别的注意图，以突出显示对象区域和交互区域。然后，我们提出了一种帧间注意增强策略，该策略利用相邻帧的光流来增强注意图，使其具有运动感知能力和对运动模糊的鲁棒性。这一步为WS-DSGG产生了关系和运动感知的知识挖掘。(2)我们引入了一个双流融合模块，将特定于类别的注意图集成到外部检测中，以细化对象定位并提高对象建议的置信度分数。

Result: TRKT在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Motivation: the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals.

Method: AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide

slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg is a human-in-the-loop framework for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation that uses sparse human annotations to achieve high-quality segmentation for both base and novel classes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality.

Method: The authors propose HOW-Seg, a human-in-the-loop framework for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg). It constructs class prototypes directly on the query data and uses sparse human annotations as guidance. A hierarchical prototype disambiguation mechanism refines ambiguous prototypes, and a dense conditional random field (CRF) optimizes label assignments.

Result: HOW-Seg matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg) method under the 5-shot setting with sparse annotations. With advanced backbones and denser annotations, HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2, significantly outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions through iterative human feedback, achieving high-quality segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with sparse annotations, HOW-Seg matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg) method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones and denser annotations, HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2, significantly outperforming alternatives.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的3D高斯溅射方法，该方法通过自适应加权高斯来提高稀疏视图场景下的渲染质量，并通过不确定性学习和dropout正则化来避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3DGS方法中，Gaussians在渲染时被同等加权，这使得它们容易过拟合，尤其是在稀疏视图的情况下。

Method: 通过学习到的不确定性来表征Guassian的自适应加权如何影响渲染质量。

Result: 在广泛采用的数据集上进行的大量实验结果表明，该方法在稀疏视图3D合成中优于现有方法，例如，与DropGaussian相比，该方法在MipNeRF 360数据集上实现了3.27％的PSNR改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图3D合成中优于现有方法，与现有稀疏视图方法相比，在大多数数据集中以更少的Guassian实现了更高质量的重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area, called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate.

Method: This paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i) allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Our results show that the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Conclusion: The additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Motivation: 基于扩散的图像压缩具有令人印象深刻的感知性能。但是，它有两个关键缺点：(1) 由于多步采样导致过度的解码延迟，以及 (2) 由于过度依赖生成先验而导致的保真度差。

Method: 利用预训练的基于 VAE 的模型生成具有丰富信息的潜在变量，并用单步解码代替迭代去噪过程。引入保真度指导模块，鼓励输出忠实于原始图像。设计了速率退火训练策略，以在极低的比特率下实现有效的训练。

Conclusion: SODEC在速率-失真-感知性能方面显著优于现有方法，并且解码速度比以前的基于扩散的压缩模型提高了 20 倍以上。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的模型依赖于精心准备但有限的数据，导致在分布外 (OOD) 场景中性能显着下降。最近的基础模型通过大规模训练在单眼深度估计中表现出卓越的鲁棒性，并且使用这些模型来增强深度补全模型的鲁棒性是一种有前途的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架在 OOD 场景中表现出色，优于现有的最先进的深度补全方法。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modality separation framework for unsupervised domain adaptation with vision-language models, improving performance by addressing the modality gap and enhancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct UDA with VLMs suffers from suboptimal performance due to the modality gap, where only modality-invariant knowledge is transferred.

Method: A unified modality separation framework is proposed to handle modality-specific and modality-invariant components separately. A modality discrepancy metric is designed to categorize samples, and modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 9% performance gain with 9 times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the design.

Conclusion: The proposed modality separation framework improves UDA performance by disentangling and handling modality-specific and modality-invariant components, achieving significant performance gains with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Motivation: 早期的视觉皮层可以快速学习全局图像上下文，如群体反应的稀疏化和暴露于熟悉与新图像上下文时平均活动的减少所证明。这种现象主要归因于局部循环相互作用，而不是前馈或反馈通路的变化。

Conclusion: 熟悉性训练将全局敏感性引入到分层网络的早期层中，并且混合的快速和慢速权重架构可以为研究大脑中的快速全局上下文学习提供可行的计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉-语言模型在Re-ID任务中表现出有效性，但在被遮挡的场景中面临重大挑战，因为它们侧重于整体图像语义，而忽略了细粒度的属性信息。当处理部分遮挡的行人或区分具有细微外观差异的个体时，这种限制变得特别明显。

Conclusion: AG-ReID在多个Re-ID数据集上实现了最先进的结果，在处理遮挡和细微属性差异方面表现出显着改进，同时在标准Re-ID场景中保持了有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CRAM, a video continual learning method that uses compressed video and a refreshing scheme to reduce memory footprint and improve performance on large-scale video datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical video CL is challenging because of the high memory requirements of video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints.

Method: The paper proposes to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling buffer. A scheme to deal with the forgetting of the video compressor by refreshing video codes is also proposed.

Result: The paper expands current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos in under 2 GB, and demonstrates empirically that the proposed video CL method outperforms prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed video CL method (CRAM) outperforms prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms

Method: MCDRL分两步实现：首先，利用CLIP的跨模态能力识别候选病灶区域，并通过文本提示构建混淆因素字典；其次，训练一个因果干预网络，利用该字典识别和消除这些特定领域的变异的影响，同时保留对分割任务至关重要的解剖结构信息。

Result: MCDRL始终优于其他方法，产生卓越的分割精度并表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCDRL在分割精度和泛化能力上优于其他方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

TL;DR: 构建了一个新的数据集 (AU-IQA) 并使用它来评估现有图像质量评估 (IQA) 方法在评估 AI 增强的 UGC 方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏专业的质量评估模型已成为一个重要的限制因素，限制了用户体验并阻碍了增强方法的进步。感知质量评估方法在 UGC 和 AIGC 上都表现出强大的性能，但它们在 AI 增强的 UGC (AI-UGC) 上的有效性在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 构建了一个包含 4,800 张 AI-UGC 图像的基准数据集 AU-IQA，这些图像由三种具有代表性的增强类型（包括超分辨率、弱光增强和去噪）生成。对该数据集上的一系列现有质量评估模型进行了评估，包括传统 IQA 方法和大型多模态模型。

Result: AI-UGC 的感知质量。

Conclusion: 对现有方法在评估 AI-UGC 的感知质量方面的表现进行了全面分析。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis and treatment of skin carcinoma are critical, but manual generation of SOAP notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal framework (skin-SOAP) is proposed to generate SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text.

Result: skin-SOAP achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro. Two new metrics, MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS), are introduced to evaluate clinical relevance.

Conclusion: The study introduces skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework for generating clinically structured SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text. It achieves performance comparable to strong baselines and introduces new metrics for clinical relevance.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像结构相似性度量方法SCSSIM，它不需要训练，能够有效地评估图像的结构保持性，尤其适用于生成模型的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI模型的快速发展需要超越人类感知范围的图像质量评估新方法。这些模型的关键问题是保持图像的底层场景结构（SCS），即对象与背景之间的几何关系、它们的相对位置、大小、方向等。

Method: 提出了一种名为SCSSIM的新型、分析性的、免训练的指标，该指标通过利用从图像的立方体分层分区导出的统计量来量化SCS的保留程度，从而稳健地捕获非基于对象的结构关系。

Result: 实验表明，SCSSIM对非组合失真具有高度不变性，准确地反映了未改变的SCS。相反，对于组合失真，它表现出强烈的单调递减，精确地表明了SCS何时被改变。与现有指标相比，SCSSIM在结构评估方面表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: SCSSIM是一种用于评估图像结构相似性的有效工具，尤其适用于生成模型的开发和评估，能够确保场景结构的完整性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Conclusion: The proposed HAMoBE framework achieves significant performance improvements on video-based ReID benchmarks like MEVID (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors

Method: classification and adversarial learning

Result: N/A

Conclusion: explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 GAN 的方法通常依赖于精心设计的损失函数来平衡转移质量和面部识别一致性，而基于扩散的方法通常依赖于额外的面部控制模块或算法来保持身份。然而，这些辅助组件往往会引入额外的误差，从而导致次优的转移结果。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了 FLUX-Makeup，这是一种高保真、身份一致且稳健的化妆转移框架，它消除了对任何辅助面部控制组件的需求。

Method: FLUX-Makeup 建立在 FLUX-Kontext 的基础上，使用源图像作为其原生条件输入。此外，我们还引入了 RefLoRAInjector，一个轻量级的化妆特征注入器，它将参考路径与主干分离，从而能够高效而全面地提取与化妆相关的信息。同时，我们设计了一个稳健且可扩展的数据生成管道，以便在训练期间提供更准确的监督。

Result: FLUX-Makeup 实现了最先进的性能，在各种场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup 实现了最先进的性能，在各种场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的应用程序经常面临数据隐私约束和高采集成本，这使得增量任务中充分训练数据的假设不切实际，并导致类增量学习中性能的显著下降。现有方法仍然难以平衡基类可区分性和新类泛化。在增量任务期间，对原始数据的有限访问通常会导致模糊的类间决策边界。

Method: SMP：一种新颖的FSCIL方法，它在参数高效的微调范例中战略性地整合了不同阶段的边际惩罚。具体来说，MIAM机制用于基础任务学习，MPCC策略用于改进决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的大量实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中实现了最先进的性能，同时在基类和新类之间保持了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: SMP在FSCIL中实现了最先进的性能，同时在基类和新类之间保持了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉基础框架，该框架利用从单个文本输入生成的多个潜在表达式，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于单个文本输入，这仅捕获视觉域中可用的大量信息的一小部分。丰富视觉细节和稀疏文本线索之间的这种不匹配可能导致相似对象的错误识别。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的视觉基础框架，该框架通过结合原始描述中没有的互补视觉细节，利用从单个文本输入生成的多个潜在表达式。具体来说，引入了主题分配器和视觉概念注入器模块，以将共享主题和不同属性概念嵌入到潜在表示中，从而捕获独特且特定于目标的视觉线索。还提出了一种正边距对比学习策略，以将所有潜在表达式与原始文本对齐，同时保留细微的变化。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中优于最先进的 RIS 和 REC 方法，并且在广义指代表达式分割 (GRES) 基准测试中实现了出色的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个基准测试中优于最先进的 RIS 和 REC 方法，并且在广义指代表达式分割 (GRES) 基准测试中实现了出色的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架FedGIN，用于多模态医学图像分割，该框架在不共享原始患者数据的情况下，通过全局强度非线性(GIN)增强模块协调模态特定的强度分布，实现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在人工智能辅助诊断、手术计划和治疗监测中起着关键作用。准确和稳健的分割模型对于在不同的成像模式中实现可靠的、数据驱动的临床决策至关重要。鉴于不同模式的图像特征存在内在的可变性，开发一种能够有效推广到多种模式的统一模型将是非常有益的。这种模型可以简化临床工作流程，并减少对特定模式训练的需求。然而，实际部署面临着主要的挑战，包括数据稀缺、模态之间的域转移(例如，CT与MRI)以及阻止数据共享的隐私限制。

Method: FedGIN，一种联邦学习(FL)框架，可以在不共享原始患者数据的情况下实现多模态器官分割。我们的方法集成了一个轻量级的全局强度非线性(GIN)增强模块，该模块在本地训练期间协调模态特定的强度分布。

Result: 在有限的数据情景中，与没有GIN的FL相比，FedGIN在MRI测试用例中实现了12%到18%的3D Dice评分改进，并且始终优于本地基线。在完整数据集情景中，FedGIN表现出接近中心化的性能，MRI-only基线提高了30%的Dice评分，CT-only基线提高了10%，突出了其在隐私约束下强大的跨模态泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedGIN在完整数据集情景下表现出接近中心化的性能，MRI-only基线提高了30%的Dice评分，CT-only基线提高了10%，突出了其在隐私约束下强大的跨模态泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的慢性疼痛行为评估方法主要依赖于人工标注行为特征，并且人类对于哪些行为最能代表慢性疼痛缺乏清晰的认识。因此，现有方法难以准确捕捉慢性疼痛中隐匿和持续的行为变化。

Method: 该方法使用通用动作空间投影器自动提取小鼠动作特征，并通过保留原始视频中丰富的行为信息来避免人类标记的潜在偏差。

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

*Qi Xie,Jiahong Fu,Zongben Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rotation equivariant ASISR method to address the issue of warped and deformed geometric patterns in low-resolution images, enhancing the recovery of high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A crucial challenge of arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) is that many common geometric patterns are seriously warped and deformed in the low-resolution images, leading to unexpected artifacts. Embedding rotation equivariance into the ASISR network is necessary to faithfully maintain the original orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns.

Method: The basic architectures of INR and encoder modules are redesigned, incorporating intrinsic rotation equivariance capabilities.

Result: The ASISR network can be implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to output. Theoretical analysis evaluates its intrinsic equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an equivariance structure.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation equivariant ASISR method demonstrates superior performance on both simulated and real datasets and can be readily integrated into current ASISR methods to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: X-MoGen是第一个统一的跨物种文本驱动运动生成框架，涵盖人类和动物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常分别对人类和动物的运动进行建模，而联合跨物种方法具有关键优势，例如统一的表示和改进的泛化。然而，跨物种的形态差异仍然是一个关键挑战，通常会影响运动的合理性。

Method: X-MoGen 采用两阶段架构。首先，条件图变分自动编码器学习规范的 T 姿势先验，而自动编码器将运动编码到由形态损失正则化的共享潜在空间中。在第二阶段，我们执行掩码运动建模以生成以文本描述为条件的运动嵌入。在训练期间，采用形态一致性模块来提高跨物种的骨骼合理性。

Result: X-MoGen优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: X-MoGen在UniMo4D数据集上优于现有技术水平的方法，适用于可见和不可见的物种。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

TL;DR: 提出了PhysPatch，一种物理上可实现且可转移的对抗补丁框架，用于攻击基于MLLM的自动驾驶系统，并在现实场景中表现出强大的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）强大的视觉-语言推理能力，它们正成为自动驾驶（AD）系统中不可或缺的一部分。然而，MLLM容易受到对抗性攻击，特别是对抗性补丁攻击，这可能在现实场景中构成严重威胁。现有的基于补丁的攻击方法主要为目标检测模型设计，当转移到基于MLLM的系统时，由于后者复杂的架构和推理能力，性能较差。

Method: 提出了PhysPatch，这是一个为基于MLLM的AD系统量身定制的物理上可实现且可转移的对抗补丁框架。PhysPatch联合优化补丁的位置、形状和内容，以提高攻击有效性和现实世界的适用性。它引入了一种基于语义的掩码初始化策略，用于逼真的放置，一种基于SVD的局部对齐损失与补丁引导的裁剪-调整，以提高可转移性，以及一种基于势场的掩码细化方法。

Result: 在开放源代码、商业和具有推理能力的MLLM上进行的大量实验表明，

Conclusion: PhysPatch在将基于MLLM的AD系统引导至目标对齐的感知和规划输出方面，显著优于现有方法。此外，PhysPatch始终将对抗性补丁放置在AD场景中物理上可行的区域，确保了强大的现实世界适用性和可部署性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Conclusion: 在通用多目标跟踪基准上的大量实验证明了该框架的竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher, a generalizable endoscopic image matcher, uses a Vision Transformer trained on a large multi-domain dataset to achieve state-of-the-art results in zero-shot matching experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is challenging due to difficult visual conditions and a scarcity of annotated data.

Method: EndoMatcher uses a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks and is trained on the Endo-Mix6 dataset using a progressive multi-objective training strategy.

Result: EndoMatcher increases inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder datasets, respectively, and improves MDPA by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher demonstrates significant improvements in endoscopic image matching, achieving higher inlier matches and MDPA compared to state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot experiments.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

TL;DR: VFlowOpt 通过创新性的剪枝框架和策略，显著减少了大型多模态模型中的视觉 token 数量，从而降低了计算成本并提高了推理速度，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型 (LMM) 通过利用大量视觉 token 来获取细粒度的视觉信息，从而在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但这种 token 冗余会导致大量的计算成本。以往旨在减少推理期间视觉 token 的研究通常利用从纯视觉 token 或视觉语言 token 之间的注意力分数导出的重要性图，以跨一个或多个剪枝阶段修剪 token。尽管取得了这些进展，但剪枝框架和策略仍然过于简单，探索不足，经常导致严重的性能下降。

Method: 我们提出了 VFlowOpt，这是一个 token 剪枝框架，它引入了重要性图推导过程和一个带有回收机制的渐进式剪枝模块。其剪枝策略的超参数通过视觉信息流引导方法进一步优化。

Result: VFlowOpt 可以在保持性能相当的同时修剪 90% 的视觉 token，从而减少 89% 的 KV-Cache 内存，并加快 3.8 倍的推理速度。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt 可以在保持性能相当的同时修剪 90% 的视觉 token，从而减少 89% 的 KV-Cache 内存，并加快 3.8 倍的推理速度。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Conclusion: 该方法在四个跨域数据集的 1-shot 和 5-shot 设置下，分别实现了平均分割精度 2.18% 和 4.11% 的提升，显著优于最先进的 CD-FSS 方法。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

*Xiao Wang,Liye Jin,Xufeng Lou,Shiao Wang,Lan Chen,Bo Jiang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a new vision-language tracking framework using reasoning-based natural language generation and a new large-scale dataset, TNLLT, to improve tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods have limited performance due to directly fusing fixed language with vision features or simply modifying using attention. Recent text generation approaches lack insights into the model's reasoning and don't fully leverage large models.

Method: The paper proposes ReasoningTrack, a reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework based on the pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. It uses both SFT and reinforcement learning GRPO for optimization and embeds updated language descriptions into a unified tracking backbone network with vision features. A tracking head predicts the target object's location.

Result: The paper introduces a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking benchmark dataset, TNLLT, containing 200 video sequences. 20 baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset.

Conclusion: The paper validates the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning-based natural language generation strategy through experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved challenge in numerous industrial settings. Traditional approaches assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup.

Method: fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1

Result: accurately segment highly non-convex, irregular bubble structures

Conclusion: SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial

Conclusion: 尽管存在技术差异，但大多数大型语言模型在输赢方面仍然保持乐观，表明它们比人类更能适应高压对抗环境。循环胜负的复杂关系暴露了大型语言模型在游戏过程中技能发挥的不稳定性，需要进一步解释和探索。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Motivation: 当前大多数解决方案依赖于云端LLM，需要持续的互联网访问，并由于集中式服务器处理而引发用户的隐私和可扩展性问题。

Method: 比较了三种实现AWebGIS的方法：(1)使用云端LLM的完全自动化在线方法；(2)使用经典机器学习分类器的半自动化离线方法；(3)基于在客户端Web浏览器中执行的微调小型语言模型（SLM）的完全自主离线（客户端）方法。

Result: 基于SLM的第三种方法在所有方法中实现了最高的精度，精确匹配精度为0.93，Levenshtein相似度为0.99，ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L评分为0.98。

Conclusion: 在客户端执行的SLM实现了最高的精度，证明了浏览器可执行模型对于AWebGIS解决方案的可行性。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical

Motivation: 人工智能智能体在医疗保健研究中的功效受到其对静态、预定义策略的依赖的阻碍。这造成了一个关键的限制：智能体可以成为更好的工具使用者，但不能学会成为更好的战略规划者，而战略规划者是医疗保健等复杂领域的一项关键技能。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic

HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

Motivation: current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands and proteins.

Method: a novel game-theoretic framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which alternately trains these players through a two-level loop.

Result: LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10% improvement in predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10% improvement in predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy of molecular docking in drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

TL;DR: LLMs can be used for spatial data integration, especially when provided with relevant features and a review-and-refine method to correct errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases, requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples.

Method: We adapt a review-and-refine method to correct erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses, and provide LLMs with relevant features to reduce dependence on spatial reasoning.

Result: LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities but struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. However, when provided relevant features, LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. The review-and-refine method proves remarkably effective.

Conclusion: LLMs are a promising and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based heuristics for adaptive spatial data integration.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Conclusion: CogniWeb在WebArena上实现了有竞争力的性能（43.96%的成功率），同时保持了显著更高的效率（减少75%的token使用）。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Method: a lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow.

Result: achieves strong performance on 5 operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67% of tasks with more than 96.67% of simulation resources reduction.

Conclusion: EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying the analog circuit design process.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Motivation: 过程挖掘中事件日志的质量至关重要，但现实世界的事件日志中，数据的获取可能并不简单，经常会因为人工活动和相关的人工记录，或者在收集每个事件的所有属性时出现问题，最终导致记录的事件缺少一些信息。

Method: 开发了一个异构图神经网络模型

Result: 该方法在重建所有不同的事件属性方面表现出非常好的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一个异构图神经网络模型，能够补全包含不完整事件的轨迹中的缺失属性，并在不同类型的缺失值上，针对两个合成日志和四个真实事件日志，评估了该模型对抗最先进的利用自编码器的方法，表明该方法在重建所有不同的事件属性方面表现出非常好的性能。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

TL;DR: QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System, enhances reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA by dynamically selecting optimal retrieval strategies using both text and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge.

Method: QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning

Result: QA-Dragon significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Conclusion: The QA-Dragon framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Motivation: Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.  Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs.

Result: achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On ProofWriter, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2 percent through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3 percent accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On ARC, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0 percent through integration of symbolic oracles

Conclusion: This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Motivation: 使用最小模型进行推理一直是许多知识表示技术的核心，但我们对描述逻辑（DLs）中的这个问题仍然只有有限的理解。`纯'最小模型（其中所有谓词的扩展必须最小）的情况在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 在流行的DLs中解决纯最小模型问题，并对TBox施加非循环条件。

Result: 概念可满足性在最小模型中是不可判定的，即使对于$\\mathcal{EL}$也是如此。当TBox满足非循环条件时，可以重新获得可判定性，并且最坏情况下的复杂度低于双指数时间。对于DL-Lite系列，DL-Lite$_{\\text{horn}}$已经具有ExpSpace-hardness。

Conclusion: 概念可满足性在最小模型中是不可判定的，即使对于$\\mathcal{EL}$也是如此。当TBox满足非循环条件时，可以重新获得可判定性，并且最坏情况下的复杂度低于双指数时间。对于DL-Lite系列，DL-Lite$_{\\text{horn}}$已经具有ExpSpace-hardness。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with complex, multi-question reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial.

Method: A method that aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models, featuring a model-based verifier for fine-grained, sub-question-level feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal benchmarks and a newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench.

Conclusion: Training with structured, verifiable rewards is highly effective for advancing multimodal models in complex reasoning domains.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Conclusion: This paper reviews key geographic research problems, suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for

TL;DR: 现有AI评估基准未能充分评估系统性风险，与欧盟AI法案的要求存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用人工智能（GPAI）模型的快速发展需要强大的评估框架，尤其是在欧盟AI法案及其相关行为准则（CoP）等新兴法规出台的情况下。当前的AI评估实践严重依赖于已建立的基准，但这些工具并非旨在衡量新监管环境关注的系统性风险。

Method: 提出了Bench-2-CoP，一个新颖的系统性框架，该框架使用经过验证的LLM-as-judge分析，将来自广泛使用的基准的194,955个问题与欧盟AI法案的模型能力和倾向分类进行映射。

Result: 评估生态系统过度关注狭窄的行为倾向，例如“产生幻觉的倾向”（53.7%）和“歧视性偏见”（28.9%），而关键的功能能力被危险地忽略了。对于失控情景至关重要的能力，包括逃避人工监督、自我复制和自主AI开发，在整个基准语料库中没有得到任何覆盖。这转化为对“失控”（0.4%的覆盖率）和“网络攻击”（0.8%的覆盖率）等系统性风险的近乎完全的评估差距。

Conclusion: 现有AI评估体系对系统性风险的覆盖存在巨大差距，尤其是在应对欧盟AI法案等新兴法规时。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

TL;DR: use a small LLM to generate ERC datasets to address data scarcity and bias issues. The generated datasets improve the performance of ERC classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent subjectivity of soft labels.  LLMs are typically expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks remains limited.

Method: employ a small, resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with diverse properties

Conclusion: ERC classifier models trained on the generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

TL;DR: InfiAlign 是一种可扩展且具有样本效率的后训练框架，它集成了监督微调 (SFT) 和直接偏好优化 (DPO)，以增强 LLM 的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过后训练增强这些能力仍然是资源密集型的，尤其是在数据和计算成本方面。虽然最近的努力试图通过选择性数据整理来提高样本效率，但现有方法通常依赖于阻碍可扩展性的启发式或特定于任务的策略。

Method: InfiAlign，一个可扩展且具有样本效率的后训练框架，它集成了监督微调 (SFT) 和直接偏好优化 (DPO) 以对齐 LLM，从而增强推理能力。核心是一个强大的数据选择管道，该管道使用多维质量指标自动从开源推理数据集中整理高质量对齐数据。

Result: 当应用于 Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base 模型时，我们的 SFT 模型实现了与 DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B 相当的性能，同时仅使用大约 12% 的训练数据，并展示了在各种推理任务中的强大泛化能力。通过应用 DPO 获得了额外的改进，尤其是在数学推理任务中获得了显着收益。该模型在 AIME 24/25 基准测试中实现了 3.89% 的平均改进。

Conclusion: 结合有原则的数据选择和全阶段后训练可以有效地以可扩展和数据有效的方式对齐大型推理模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GRAIL 通过与大型图交互进行检索增强推理，从而提升知识图谱问答的准确率和 F1 值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 RAG 方法主要处理非结构化数据，处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）的能力有限。当前的图检索方法难以捕捉整体图结构，同时面临精度控制挑战。

Method: GRAIL 整合了 LLM 引导的随机探索与路径过滤，以建立数据合成管道，并采用两阶段训练过程来学习策略，从而动态决定每个推理步骤中的最佳操作。

Result: GRAIL 实现了显著的性能提升，在知识图谱问答任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: GRAIL在三个知识图谱问答数据集上实现了平均 21.01% 的准确率提升和 22.43% 的 F1 值提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: A new framework for evaluating agent task completion is proposed, which breaks down tasks and validates each step, showing better agreement with human evaluations than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods overlook the step-by-step reasoning in agentic decision-making and are often domain-specific.

Method: The framework decomposes tasks into sub-tasks and validates each step using available information. Each module contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy with human evaluations on GAIA and BigCodeBench, respectively, compared to a GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task completion, demonstrating improved agreement with human evaluations compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了 MV-Debate，一个用于检测社交媒体上有害内容的多智能体辩论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体已发展成为一个复杂的多模态环境，文本、图像和其他信号相互作用以塑造细微的含义，通常隐藏着有害意图。识别诸如讽刺、仇恨言论或虚假信息等意图仍然具有挑战性，因为存在跨模态矛盾、快速的文化转变和微妙的语用提示。

Method: 本文提出了一个多视角智能体辩论框架，具有动态反思门控，用于统一的多模态有害内容检测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，MV-Debate 明显优于强大的单模型和现有的多智能体辩论基线。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，多智能体辩论在推进安全关键在线环境中可靠的社会意图检测方面具有前景。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖大量人工奖励设计，面临可扩展性挑战，无法自主制定、调整和追求目标。因此，需要弥合“具身代理差距”。

Method: 将大型语言模型作为生成世界模型与AIF的决策框架相结合。

Result: AIF可以通过最小化自由能来取代外部奖励信号，使agent能够通过统一的贝叶斯目标自然地平衡探索和利用。

Conclusion: AIF结合大型语言模型，为创建能够从经验中有效学习并与人类价值观保持一致的AI系统提供了一条引人注目的路径。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to capture learning dynamics, track progress over time, or provide explainability in capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods.

Method: LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. Learners with psychologically grounded profiles (Deep, Surface, and Lazy) and a persona-free General Learner are constructed.

Result: Longitudinal analysis reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles. Learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically. The default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner".

Conclusion: The default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true, generalizable understanding. LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings about LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

Motivation: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.

Method: describes the vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline.

Result: Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Conclusion: SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.

control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a

structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.

Motivation: Resolving ambiguity in natural language queries.

Method: DASG: a dialogue-based query enhancement framework embedding interactive clarification within database systems.

Result: DASG demonstrates improved query precision while maintaining efficiency on three datasets.

Conclusion: DASG improves query precision and efficiency, enabling cooperative analytics where systems actively participate in query formulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Data-Aware Socratic Guidance (DASG), a
dialogue-based query enhancement framework that embeds \linebreak interactive
clarification as a first-class operator within database systems to resolve
ambiguity in natural language queries. DASG treats dialogue as an optimization
decision, asking clarifying questions only when the expected execution cost
reduction exceeds the interaction overhead. The system quantifies ambiguity
through linguistic fuzziness, schema grounding confidence, and projected costs
across relational and vector backends. Our algorithm selects the optimal
clarifications by combining semantic relevance, catalog-based information gain,
and potential cost reduction. We evaluate our proposed framework on three
datasets. The results show that DASG demonstrates improved query precision
while maintaining efficiency, establishing a cooperative analytics paradigm
where systems actively participate in query formulation rather than passively
translating user requests.

Motivation: 现有的检索方法侧重于事实相似性而非法律问题，并且缺乏解释来阐明案例相关性。

Method: 该方法结合了检索增强生成 (RAG) 和针对印度案例法优化的结构化摘要，并利用增强问题引导检索 (AQgR) 框架。

Result: 在 FIRE 2019 数据集子集上的实验评估显示，平均精度均值 (MAP) 得分为 0.36，平均召回率均值 (MAR) 为 0.67，显著超过了当前 0.1573 的 MAP 基准。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入法律问题提高了案例检索的准确性和相关性，更贴合法律专业人士的需求。

Abstract: Identifying relevant legal precedents remains challenging, as most retrieval
methods emphasize factual similarity over legal issues, and current systems
often lack explanations clarifying case relevance. This paper proposes the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap by facilitating the
retrieval of relevant cases, generating explanations to elucidate relevance,
and identifying core legal issues all autonomously, without requiring legal
expertise. Our approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured summaries optimized for Indian case law. Leveraging the Augmented
Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) framework, the system generates targeted legal
questions based on factual scenarios to identify relevant case law more
effectively. The structured summaries were assessed manually by legal experts,
given the absence of a suitable structured summary dataset. Case law retrieval
was evaluated using the FIRE dataset, and explanations were reviewed by legal
experts, as explanation generation alongside case retrieval is an emerging
innovation. Experimental evaluation on a subset of the FIRE 2019 dataset
yielded promising outcomes, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of
0.36 and a Mean Average Recall (MAR) of 0.67 across test queries, significantly
surpassing the current MAP benchmark of 0.1573. This work introduces a suite of
novel contributions to advance case law retrieval. By transitioning from
fact-based to legal-issue-based retrieval, the proposed approach delivers more
contextually relevant results that align closely with legal professionals'
needs. Integrating legal questions within the retrieval process through the
AQgR framework ensures more precise and meaningful retrieval by refining the

TL;DR: Introduces context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention to scale up sequence dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling sequence length is activation-heavy, necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. Production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation challenges.

Method: introducing context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention

Result: Enables a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Conclusion: This work introduces context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention, enabling a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length and a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with DDP.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

TL;DR: This paper introduces LIS, a new metric for evaluating multimodal recommendation systems, and shows its effectiveness in real-world A/B tests on Xiaohongshu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for recommendation is challenging due to the inaccuracy of static benchmarks, the high cost of online system evaluations, and the lack of actionable insights from conventional metrics.

Method: The paper proposes the Leakage Impact Score (LIS) to measure the upper bound of preference data instead of directly assessing MLLMs.

Result: Online A/B tests on Content Feed and Display Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of LIS, with significant improvements in user spent time and advertiser value.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the Leakage Impact Score (LIS) metric and demonstrates its effectiveness through online A/B tests on Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, showing improvements in user engagement and advertiser value.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

*Yongfu Zha,Xinxin Dong,Haokai Ma,Yonghui Yang,Xiaodong Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 HorizonRec，通过双向 DMs 协调三元偏好，用于跨域序列推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了缓解数据稀疏和兴趣漂移问题，传统方法通常通过跨域转换来整合来自其他领域的辅助行为。然而，现有的跨域序列推荐 (CDSR) 方法通常遵循一种对齐然后融合的范式，该范式执行跨多个域的表示级对齐，并将它们机械地组合以进行推荐，忽略了域特定偏好的细粒度融合。

Method: 提出了一种双向偏好扩散方法，以抑制潜在的噪声，并强调多域用户表示融合过程中与目标相关的兴趣。

Result: 在来自两个不同平台的四个 CDSR 数据集上进行的大量实验证明了 HorizonRec 在细粒度的三域偏好融合方面的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HorizonRec在细粒度的三域偏好融合方面表现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

TL;DR: 提出EMER框架，增强个性化，并设计损失函数以解决集成排序的监督挑战。在快手平台上实现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过用端到端建模范式取代手动设计的启发式公式来增强个性化。解决为集成排序定义有效监督的根本挑战，其中没有单一的ground-truth信号可以完全捕获用户满意度。

Method: 提出了一种新的端到端多目标集成排序框架(EMER)。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上进行了大量的经验测试，结果充分证明了我们提出的框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在快手的短视频推荐平台的主要场景中部署，使得App总停留时间增加了1.39%，7日用户生命周期(LT7)增加了0.196%，这些都是实质性的改进。

Abstract: We propose a novel End-to-end Multi-objective Ensemble Ranking framework
(EMER) for the multi-objective ensemble ranking module, which is the most
critical component of the short video recommendation system. EMER enhances
personalization by replacing manually-designed heuristic formulas with an
end-to-end modeling paradigm. EMER introduces a meticulously designed loss
function to address the fundamental challenge of defining effective supervision
for ensemble ranking, where no single ground-truth signal can fully capture
user satisfaction. Moreover, EMER introduces novel sample organization method
and transformer-based network architecture to capture the comparative
relationships among candidates, which are critical for effective ranking.
Additionally, we have proposed an offline-online consistent evaluation system
to enhance the efficiency of offline model optimization, which is an
established yet persistent challenge within the multi-objective ranking domain
in industry. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a real industrial
dataset, and the results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework. In addition, our framework has been deployed in the primary
scenarios of Kuaishou, a short video recommendation platform with hundreds of
millions of daily active users, achieving a 1.39% increase in overall App Stay
Time and a 0.196% increase in 7-day user Lifetime(LT7), which are substantial
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术出版物的快速和持续增长，识别高质量的研究已成为一个日益紧迫的挑战。虽然最近利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行自动论文评估的方法显示出了巨大的希望，但它们通常受到过时的领域知识和有限的推理能力的限制。

Method: 一种新颖的基于LLM的自动论文评估框架，该框架通过两个关键组件解决了这些限制：1）一个领域感知的论文检索模块，该模块检索相关的并发工作，以支持对新颖性和贡献的上下文化评估；2）一种潜在的推理机制，该机制能够深入理解复杂的动机和方法，以及与并发相关工作的全面比较，以支持更准确和可靠的评估。

Result: PaperEval在学术影响和论文质量评估方面始终优于现有方法。在真实的论文推荐系统中部署PaperEval，用于过滤高质量的论文，已经在社交媒体上获得了广泛的参与——积累了超过8,000名订阅者，并为许多过滤后的高质量论文吸引了超过10,000次观看——证明了PaperEval的实际有效性。

Conclusion: PaperEval在学术影响和论文质量评估方面始终优于现有方法。PaperEval已部署在真实的论文推荐系统中，用于过滤高质量的论文，并在社交媒体上获得了广泛的参与。

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

TL;DR: 提出Tool Graph Retriever (TGR)，利用工具之间的依赖关系来学习更好的工具表示以进行检索，在常用数据集上表现SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能代理的显著发展，它们配备的工具数量正在迅速增加。然而，将所有工具信息整合到有限的模型上下文中变得不切实际，突显了对有效工具检索方法的需求。主流方法主要依赖于工具描述和用户查询之间的语义相似性来检索相关工具，但是，它们通常独立考虑每个工具，忽略了工具之间的依赖关系，这可能导致遗漏成功执行任务的先决工具。

Method: 提出Tool Graph Retriever (TGR)，利用工具之间的依赖关系来学习更好的工具表示以进行检索。构建TDI300K数据集训练判别器以识别工具依赖，将候选工具表示为工具依赖图，并使用图卷积将依赖关系整合到它们的表示中。

Result: TGR可以为现有主流方法带来性能提升，实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TGR在常用数据集上表现SOTA，验证了工具依赖的重要性和TGR的有效性。

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify
the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) within the RecJPQ framework to improve personalized novelty in music recommendations without sacrificing accuracy, addressing the limitation of item-level PPS reinforcing already-known content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS) enhances relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content, limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items.

Method: A novel integration of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework.

Result: sPPS consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法存在常见局限：解释与模型预测 слабо 对齐，在识别用户意图时模糊或不准确，以及过度重复或笼统。

Method: 结合了基于SHAP的特征属性与结构化的、prompt驱动的语言生成。

Result: FIRE生成忠实、多样且与用户对齐的解释，这些解释基于模型的实际决策过程。结果表明，

Conclusion: FIRE不仅实现了有竞争力的推荐准确率，而且在对齐、结构和忠实度等关键维度上显著提高了推荐解释的质量。这项工作强调了超越“评论即解释”模式，并朝着兼顾问责和可解释性的解释方法发展的必要性。

Abstract: Natural language explanations in recommender systems are often framed as a
review generation task, leveraging user reviews as ground-truth supervision.
While convenient, this approach conflates a user's opinion with the system's
reasoning, leading to explanations that may be fluent but fail to reflect the
true logic behind recommendations. In this work, we revisit the core objective
of explainable recommendation: to transparently communicate why an item is
recommended by linking user needs to relevant item features. Through a
comprehensive analysis of existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets,
we identify common limitations-explanations that are weakly aligned with model
predictions, vague or inaccurate in identifying user intents, and overly
repetitive or generic. To overcome these challenges, we propose FIRE, a
lightweight and interpretable framework that combines SHAP-based feature
attribution with structured, prompt-driven language generation. FIRE produces
faithful, diverse, and user-aligned explanations, grounded in the actual
decision-making process of the model. Our results demonstrate that FIRE not
only achieves competitive recommendation accuracy but also significantly
improves explanation quality along critical dimensions such as alignment,
structure, and faithfulness. This work highlights the need to move beyond the
review-as-explanation paradigm and toward explanation methods that are both
accountable and interpretable.

*Benedikt Kantz,Stefan Lengauer,Peter Waldert,Tobias Schreck*

TL;DR: A visual querying interface uses graph differences and a natural language interface to communicate changes during iterative query building, fostering data exploration and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual query builders enable non-expert users to construct SPARQL queries, but query building is iterative and the user's question can change throughout the process, especially for explorative search.

Method: A visual querying interface communicates changes between iterative steps using graph differences and a natural language interface.

Result: The change in results is communicated in the result view by contrasting the differences in both result distribution and individual instances of the prototype graph. The system's applicability is demonstrated through case studies on different ontologies and usage scenarios.

Conclusion: The system fosters data exploration and analysis of domain-specific graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain vast amounts of linked resources that encode
knowledge in various domains, which can be queried and searched for using
specialized languages like SPARQL, a query language developed to query KGs.
Existing visual query builders enable non-expert users to construct SPARQL
queries and utilize the knowledge contained in these graphs. Query building is,
however, an iterative and, often, visual process where the question of the user
can change and differ throughout the process, especially for explorative
search. Our visual querying interface communicates these change between
iterative steps in the query building process using graph differences to
contrast the changes and the evolution in the graph query. We also enable users
to formulate their evolving information needs using a natural language
interface directly integrated into the difference query view. We, furthermore,
communicate the change in results in the result view by contrasting the
differences in both result distribution and individual instances of the
prototype graph and demonstrate the system's applicability through case studies
on different ontologies and usage scenarios, illustrating how our system
fosters, both, data exploration and analysis of domain-specific graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation, aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2) the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the accurate modeling of user preferences.

Method: We propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR). This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data, thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance recommendation performance.

Result: Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 当在线测试不切实际或有风险时，离线评估在推荐系统基准测试中起着核心作用。然而，它容易受到两种关键偏差的影响：暴露偏差（用户只与他们看到的项目互动）和抽样偏差（当评估是在记录项目的子集上进行而不是在整个目录上进行时引入）。

Conclusion: 本文研究了不同的日志记录和抽样选择如何影响离线评估的可靠性，并为选择产生可靠和稳健的离线比较的策略提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document
reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable,
user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a
unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval
pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based
feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple
evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons
with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end
RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback
through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with
auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality
ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling
comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations.
All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used
to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy
selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/,

Conclusion: KuaiLive can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware recommendation.

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional
recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the
lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature
of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the
first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live
streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over
a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several
advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple
types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation
methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive
can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K
recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables
research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware
recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的集群感知分层联邦聚合框架，用于在边缘设备上实现高效和可扩展的个性化 AIGC 服务，同时减轻隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型 (DM) 已成为高质量内容生成的强大工具，但它们在推理方面的密集计算需求对资源受限的边缘设备提出了挑战。云解决方案有助于计算，但通常无法解决多用户边缘 AIGC 场景中的隐私风险、个性化效率和通信成本。

Method: 提出了一种新的集群感知分层联邦聚合框架。该框架基于通过低秩自适应 (LoRA) 进行的参数高效本地微调，首先根据客户端上传的任务要求的相似性对客户端进行聚类，然后在服务器端进行集群内聚合，以增强个性化。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了加速收敛，同时保持了在边缘约束下可扩展的多用户个性化 AIGC 服务的实际可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSL is crucial in biomedical, environmental, materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically constrained.

Method: The authors constructed M3FD (over 10K+ few-shot samples) and introduced M3F, a LMMM framework tailored for data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of scientific data types through a modular pipeline. The model is fine-tuned on M3FD.

Result: M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL deployment. The dataset and a user-friendly tool enable efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing.

Conclusion: The study introduces M3F, a novel LMMM framework, and M3FD, a multi-modal few-shot dataset, to improve FSL model performance in data-scarce scientific domains. The dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in these domains.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

*Xuan Lin,Long Chen,Yile Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided RL framework, improves molecular property prediction with LLMs by eliciting relevant attributes and enhancing interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in molecular property prediction rely on human-crafted prompts and can be verbose and lack relevance.

Method: Attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework with format, count, and rationality rewards to steer the model's reasoning.

Result: Training 7B-size models with AttriLens-Mol boosts performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning and advanced models. Extracted attributes yield superior performance in a decision tree model.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. Experiments show AttriLens-Mol significantly boosts performance, achieving comparable or better results than other models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PA-RNet是一种鲁棒的多模态预测框架，它通过扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意机制来分离文本噪声，提高模型在噪声条件下的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，多模态时间序列数据经常受到干扰，尤其是在文本模态中。现有的多模态时间序列预测方法通常忽略文本数据中固有的扰动，其中无关、嘈杂或模糊的内容会显著降低模型性能，尤其是在噪声表现出不同强度或源于结构不一致时。

Method: PA-RNet具有扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，可以有效地将噪声与文本嵌入分离，同时保持语义上有意义的表示。

Result: 建立了PA-RNet相对于文本输入的Lipschitz连续性，并证明了所提出的扰动模块可以减少预期的预测误差，从而为噪声条件下的稳定性提供了有力的保证。此外，我们还引入了一个文本扰动管道，可以无缝地集成到现有的多模态时间序列预测任务中，从而可以在存在不同级别的文本噪声的情况下对模型的鲁棒性进行系统评估。

Conclusion: PA-RNet在各种领域和时间设置中始终优于最先进的基线模型。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

*Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ is a training-free method for mixed-precision quantization that uses mutual information to measure layer sensitivity, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding the optimal bit-width for each layer in mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is a complex problem. Current methods are computationally expensive or fail to capture the global effects of quantization error. The paper argues that layer sensitivity should be measured by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire network.

Method: The paper introduces InfoQ, a training-free framework for mixed-precision quantization (MPQ). It assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each layer at different bit-widths and measuring the resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. Bit-width allocation is formulated as an integer linear programming problem.

Result: InfoQ provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off, using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: InfoQ achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods like LIMPQ, with 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates.

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

*Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在动态胰岛素剂量调节中的应用，发现其在特定情况下表现良好，但也存在局限性，提示需要谨慎应用并结合其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于强化学习（RL）的动态治疗方案（DTR）在自动化复杂临床决策方面具有前景，但它们的实际部署仍然受到注入临床知识和确保患者安全所需的大量工程的阻碍。大型语言模型（LLM）的最新进展表明了一种互补的方法，其中隐含的先验知识和临床启发式通过语言提示自然嵌入，而不需要特定于环境的训练。

Method: 使用in silico 1型糖尿病模拟器评估了开源LLM作为动态胰岛素剂量调节剂的性能，并将其零样本推理性能与经过专门训练的小型神经网络RL智能体（SRA）进行了比较。

Result: 精心设计的零样本prompt使较小的LLM（例如，Qwen2.5-7B）能够获得与经过大量训练的SRA相当或更优越的临床性能，尤其是在稳定的患者队列中。然而，LLM表现出明显的局限性，例如在使用思维链（CoT）推理时胰岛素剂量过于激进，突出了包括算术幻觉、时间误解和不一致的临床逻辑在内的关键失败模式。对潜在临床状态（例如，膳食）进行显式推理几乎没有带来性能提升，这突显了当前模型仅通过文本推理捕获复杂、隐藏生理动态的局限性。

Conclusion: 谨慎而乐观地将LLM集成到临床工作流程中，强调有必要进行有针对性的prompt工程、仔细的验证，并可能采用混合方法，将语言推理与结构化生理建模相结合，以实现安全、稳健和临床有效的决策支持系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

### [154] [Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04780)
*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an equity-aware power restoration strategy (EPOPR) to address disparities in power outage duration, using a predict-then-optimize framework with uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction and spatial-temporal attentional reinforcement learning. EPOPR reduces outage duration and inequity compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Current restoration solutions are inequitable because disadvantaged communities submit fewer restoration requests, leaving them vulnerable to extended power outages. Achieving equity is challenging due to the difficulty of predicting repair durations and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions.

Method: We design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making.

Result: EPOPR reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed EPOPR framework effectively reduces average power outage duration and decreases inequity between different communities compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们提出了联邦持续推荐（FCRec），并提出了一个解决方案框架F3CRec，它优于现有的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦推荐（FedRec）方法难以处理非平稳数据流，无法长期保持一致的推荐质量。另一方面，持续学习推荐（CLRec）方法虽然可以解决不断变化的用户偏好，但通常假设集中式数据访问，使其与联邦学习的约束不兼容。为了弥合这一差距，我们引入了联邦持续推荐（FCRec），这是一个集成了FedRec和CLRec的新任务，要求模型在保护隐私的同时从流数据中学习。

Method: 我们提出了F3CRec，一个旨在平衡FCRec严格约束下的知识保留和适应的框架。F3CRec引入了两个关键组件：客户端的自适应重放记忆，它根据用户特定的变化选择性地保留过去的偏好；以及服务器端的项目级时间平均，它在保留先前信息的同时整合新的知识。

Result: F3CRec在联邦环境中，在维持推荐质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F3CRec在联邦环境中，在维持推荐质量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

Motivation: 设计一种以人为本的网约车系统，在不影响整体系统效率的情况下，兼顾乘客的公平性和驾驶员的偏好。

Result: HCRide 有效地提高了系统效率、公平性和驾驶员偏好。

Conclusion: HCRide 有效地将系统效率提高了 2.02%，公平性提高了 5.39%，驾驶员偏好提高了 10.21%。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [157] [Unified Flow Matching for Long Horizon Event Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04843)
*Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于标记时间点过程的统一流匹配框架，该框架能够对事件间时间和事件类型进行非自回归联合建模，并在长时程预测中优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对长时程标记事件序列进行建模是许多实际应用中的一个基本挑战，包括医疗保健、金融和用户行为建模。现有的神经时间点过程模型通常是自回归的，一次预测下一步事件，这限制了它们的效率，并导致远程预测中的误差累积。

Method: 我们提出了一个统一的流匹配框架，用于标记时间点过程，该框架通过连续和离散流匹配来实现事件间时间和事件类型的非自回归联合建模。

Result: 通过学习这两个组件的连续时间流，我们的方法生成连贯的长时程事件轨迹，而无需顺序解码。

Conclusion: 该模型在六个真实世界的基准测试中进行了评估，并在准确性和生成效率方面证明了相对于自回归和基于扩散的基线模型的显着改进。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol lacks built-in security and is susceptible to cyber-attacks.

Method: A multi-stage intrusion detection framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph learning, combining a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack classification.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage intrusion detection framework achieves competitive accuracy and efficiency on CAN intrusion datasets, with significant F1-score improvements over existing methods, especially on imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

TL;DR: This paper provides the first quantitative error bounds for OPTQ and Qronos, offering theoretical justification and guidance for practical design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OPTQ lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees.

Method: The paper analyzes how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses.

Result: The paper provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices, including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic variant, stronger infinity-norm error bounds are established, which enable control over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for downstream layers and nonlinearities.  New theoretical bounds for Qronos are also provided.

Conclusion: This paper presents the first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ algorithm. The analysis provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices, including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic variant, stronger infinity-norm error bounds are established. The analysis is extended to Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agnostics is a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that improves LLM code generation in low-resource languages by using verifiable rewards and a single verifier for all languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with code generation in low-resource languages due to data scarcity and the need for language-specific post-training infrastructure.

Method: Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline, uses an LLM to rewrite unit tests into an I/O format, applies a configuration for compiling and running a target language, and uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Agnostics improves Qwen-3 4B to rival 16B-70B models, scales to larger models, and sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on MultiPL-E and LiveCodeBench for <=16B parameter models.

Conclusion: Agnostics improves code generation performance in low-resource languages, achieving state-of-the-art results on MultiPL-E and LiveCodeBench.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO) to address some limitations of existing methods by incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), but the existing method has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information to learn an effective network.

Method: introducing the Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO), a new neural operator architecture by incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing and mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert transform

Result: spectral convolution is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed representation

Conclusion: HNO can model operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary systems.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

*Sinho Chewi,Philippe Rigollet,Yuling Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores implementing dynamics directly over probability measures using Gaussian mixture models and Wasserstein gradient flows, introducing a new Gaussian mixture (GM) layer. The GM layer achieves comparable performance to fully connected networks but exhibits different behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures.

Method: employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into neural network architectures.

Result: demonstrate numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to classical fully connected layers

Conclusion: A Gaussian mixture (GM) layer achieves test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network. GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be considered in the mean-field regime.

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate

we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动投标策略的日益普及，计算敏感的检索阶段和排序阶段之间的不一致性变得更加明显，因为前者无法访问大量广告语料库的精确的实时投标。这种差异导致平台收入和广告商结果欠佳。

Method: Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR)，一个基于模型的检索框架，通过将广告出价纳入检索评分函数来解决多阶段不一致性问题。核心创新是竞价感知建模，通过单调约束学习和多任务蒸馏来整合竞价信号，以确​​保经济上连贯的表示，而异步近线推理能够实时更新嵌入，从而实现市场响应。

Result: 平台收入增加了4.32%，正面运营广告的展示次数增加了22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR在阿里巴巴的展示广告平台上进行了广泛的离线实验和全面部署，验证了其有效性：平台收入增加了4.32%，正面运营广告的展示次数增加了22.2%。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Motivation: 地表臭氧 (O3) 是一种重要的污染物，其趋势的驱动因素难以建模，传统的基于物理的模型在与人类健康影响相关的尺度上的实际应用不足。基于深度学习的模拟器在捕获复杂的气候模式方面显示出希望，但总体上缺乏支持政策变化和公共卫生措施的关键决策所需的解释性。

Conclusion: 使用不确定性感知 U-Net 架构来预测 Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data assimilation (MOMO-Chem) 模型的地表臭氧残差（偏差）。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems. Deep learning models struggle to generalize across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation.

Method: We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. We explore and compare both similarity-based and mutual information-based RAF methods.

Result: RAF framework yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy on real-world data from the Everglades.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the RAF framework yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy and highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology.

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices often rely on inconsistent and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability. Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection.

Method: Using real and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics, consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters.

Result: Matthews and Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured expert-level AI performance.

Conclusion: We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure detection.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the replicability of transfer learning, finding a trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Source domain pretraining can mitigate failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of transfer learning adaptations remains poorly understood, particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically prioritize training examples.

Method: Introducing a mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Formalization of selection sensitivity (ΔQ), a measure that captures how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data.

Result: Replicability failure probability increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while decreasing exponentially with sample size. Highly adaptive strategies achieve superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates, while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%.

Conclusion: Source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism, reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

Motivation: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse on social media, linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing it requires robust automated detection methods.

Method: Exploration of transformer-based models for hate speech detection using the MetaHate dataset.

Result: Evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieves the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). Challenges remain with sarcasm, coded language, and label noise.

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

Conclusion: DAL算法的性能在不同领域和任务设置中差异显著；在非标准场景（如不平衡和开放集设置）中，DAL算法仍有改进空间，需要进一步研究；一些算法表现良好，但选择时间较长。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Result: achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English

Conclusion: REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: We propose a novel framework called Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component, thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance.

Result: SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and classification datasets demonstrate that

Conclusion: SEA consistently outperforms baseline methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct

base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss

thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning

Motivation: 在去中心化算法中，同时控制共识误差、压缩误差和动量梯度偏差具有挑战性。现有方法未能兼顾动量加速和压缩通信的优点。

Method: 设计了两种压缩的去中心化算法，分别针对梯度有界和数据异构两种场景，采用动量技术加速收敛，消息压缩技术节省通信成本。

Result: 两种方法都实现了最优收敛速度，并在一定误差容限范围内实现了线性加速和采用拓扑独立的算法参数。

Conclusion: 提出了两种压缩的去中心化算法，并在深度神经网络和Transformer上表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near

its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG

TL;DR: MMCI model uses causal intervention to address spurious correlations in multimodal sentiment analysis, improving generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations within and across modalities, leading to reliance on statistical shortcuts and undermining generalization.

Method: A Multi-relational Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model leveraging backdoor adjustment from causal theory.

Result: Improved performance on standard MSA datasets and out-of-distribution test sets.

Conclusion: The MMCI model effectively suppresses biases and improves performance on standard MSA datasets and out-of-distribution test sets.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练LLM的方法仍然严重依赖于大量人工管理的任务和标签，通常通过微调或强化学习，这对将人工智能系统推进到超越人类智能的能力构成了根本瓶颈。

Method: R-Zero，一个完全自主的框架，可以从头生成自己的训练数据。从一个单一的基础LLM开始，R-Zero初始化两个具有不同角色的独立模型，一个挑战者和一个解决者。这些模型被分别优化，并通过互动共同进化：挑战者因提出接近解决者能力边缘的任务而获得奖励，而解决者因解决挑战者提出的越来越具有挑战性的任务而获得奖励。

Result: R-Zero在不同的主干LLM上大幅提高了推理能力，例如，在数学推理基准测试中，Qwen3-4B-Base提高了+6.49，在通用领域推理基准测试中提高了+7.54。

Conclusion: R-Zero显著提高了不同backbone LLM的推理能力，例如，在数学推理基准测试中，Qwen3-4B-Base提高了+6.49，在通用领域推理基准测试中提高了+7.54。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在通过强化学习（RL）进行微调时，表现出强大的推理能力。然而，这些方法需要大量的数据和计算，使得它们对于较小的模型来说是不切实际的。当前课程学习或数据选择的方法在很大程度上是启发式驱动的，或者需要大量的计算资源，限制了它们的可扩展性和通用性。

Method: SPaRFT，一个自定进度的学习框架，通过优化使用哪些数据以及何时使用，从而实现基于模型训练能力的有效学习。首先，我们应用基于聚类的数据缩减来按语义和难度划分训练数据，提取一个紧凑而多样化的子集，从而减少冗余。然后，一个多臂老虎机将数据集群视为臂，经过优化，可以根据模型当前的性能来分配训练样本。

Result: 在多个推理基准上的实验表明，SPaRFT在达到与最先进的基线相当或更好的准确率的同时，使用的样本减少了高达100倍。消融研究和分析进一步突出了数据聚类和自适应选择的重要性。

Conclusion: SPaRFT通过精心策划的、性能驱动的训练课程，能够以最少的资源释放LLM强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Conclusion: 眼动追踪技术有潜力用于增强现实中的情境感知建模，并有助于设计确保用户安全和情境感知的增强现实系统。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Conclusion: KNOW预测始终优于朴素微调和简单权重预测，从而带来卓越的下游性能。这项工作为重新解释遗忘动态以突破深度学习中的知识转移限制提供了一个新的视角。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Result: TANGO 实现了强大的性能。

Conclusion: TANGO在节点和图分类以及回归基准测试中表现出色，证明了联合学习能量函数和切向流对于图神经网络的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

learning through the lens of statistical learning theory. We analyze how
multimodal perception (RGB-D, proprioception, language) affects sample
complexity and optimization landscapes in imitation policies. Building on
recent advances in multimodal learning theory, we show that properly integrated
multimodal policies can achieve tighter generalization bounds and more
favorable optimization landscapes than their unimodal counterparts. We provide
a comprehensive review of theoretical frameworks that explain why multimodal
architectures like PerAct and CLIPort achieve superior performance, connecting
these empirical results to fundamental concepts in Rademacher complexity, PAC
learning, and information theory.

### [184] [Integrated Influence: Data Attribution with Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05089)
*Linxiao Yang,Xinyu Gu,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Integrated Influence, a new data attribution method addressing limitations of existing methods by incorporating a baseline and considering the collective influence of training samples. It shows improved performance in data attribution and mislabeled example identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide counterfactual explanations.

Method: a novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each sample throughout this process.

Result: Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislabelled example identification task.

Conclusion: Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislabelled example identification task.

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

*Mojtaba Fayaz-Bakhsh,Danial Ataee,MohammadAmin Fazli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于冷启动主动偏好学习的新颖框架，该框架利用 PCA 进行自监督预训练，并通过主动学习循环进行细化，从而在数据受限的环境中提高了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动偏好学习是有效建模偏好的一种强大范例，但它存在冷启动问题：当没有可用的初始标记数据时，性能会显着下降。这种挑战在计算社会系统和经济分析中尤为严峻，在这些系统中，标记数据通常稀缺、昂贵且容易受到专家噪声的影响。

Method: 通过自监督预训练阶段启动学习过程，利用主成分分析 (PCA) 从数据的固有结构中获得初始伪标签，从而创建一个没有任何初始oracle交互的冷启动模型。随后，通过主动学习循环细化模型，该循环策略性地查询模拟的噪声oracle以获取标签。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的冷启动方法优于从零开始的标准主动学习策略，以更少的标记对实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过在数据受限的环境中增强样本效率和偏好学习的适用性，为缓解冷启动问题提供了一种实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

*Tomoya Tate,Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple relational perspectives. The method, SconfConfDiff Classification, integrates similarity-confidence and confidence-difference weak labels and introduces two unbiased risk estimators. The proposed method outperforms existing baselines. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is limited.

Method: SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against inaccurate class prior probability and label noise.

Result: We prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to estimation error bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines across a variety of settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习框架，用于增强函数调用，并在 Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard 上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练方法未能开发出强大的推理策略。监督微调产生的模型依赖于肤浅的模式匹配，而标准强化学习方法难以应对结构化函数调用的复杂动作空间。

Method: 一种新颖的强化学习框架，旨在通过基于策略熵的探索来增强群组相对策略优化，该框架专为函数调用任务量身定制。

Result: 该框架在函数调用任务中实现了最先进的性能，总体准确率达到 86.02%，优于标准 GRPO 高达 6%。

Conclusion: 该框架在函数调用任务中实现了最先进的性能，总体准确率达到 86.02%，优于标准 GRPO 高达 6%。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了分层联邦域泛化（HFedDG）和一种新的分层聚合方法HFedATM，用于解决分层联邦学习中的域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的联邦学习（FL）由于单个中央服务器上的计算和通信需求过高，因此面临可扩展性挑战。分层联邦学习（HFL）通过在中间节点（站点）之间分配模型聚合任务来解决这些问题，从而增强了系统可扩展性和针对单点故障的鲁棒性。但是，HFL仍然存在一个关键但经常被忽略的限制：域偏移，其中数据分布在不同的客户端和站点之间差异很大，从而降低了模型在看不见的目标域上的性能。联合域泛化（FedDG）方法已经出现以提高对域偏移的鲁棒性，但是它们与HFL框架的集成在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 提出了一种分层聚合方法HFedATM，该方法首先通过Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment对齐来自不同站的模型的卷积滤波器，然后使用Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation合并对齐的模型。

Result: HFedATM显著提升了现有FedDG基线在多个数据集上的性能，并保持了计算和通信效率。此外，理论分析表明，与标准分层平均相比，HFedATM实现了更严格的泛化误差界限，从而实现了更快的收敛和稳定的训练行为。

Conclusion: HFedATM显著提升了现有FedDG基线在多个数据集上的性能，并保持了计算和通信效率。理论分析表明，与标准分层平均相比，HFedATM实现了更严格的泛化误差界限，从而实现了更快的收敛和稳定的训练行为。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: close a significant gap in the error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing

Method: deep fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation functions in Sobolev spaces

Result: derived rates surpass those of classical numerical approximation techniques

Conclusion: deep networks can approximate weak solutions of PDEs with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a

TL;DR: PSEO是一种用于事后堆叠集成优化的框架，它通过二元二次规划进行基本模型选择，并在多样性和性能之间进行权衡, 引入了两种机制来充分发挥多层堆叠的潜力, 构建了一个超参数空间，并在其中搜索最佳的事后集成策略。在80个公共数据集上的实验表明，PSEO实现了最佳平均测试排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成学习的成功启发了最近的AutoML系统构建用于最终预测的post-hoc集成，而不是依赖于最佳单一模型。然而，虽然大多数CASH方法对最佳单一模型进行广泛搜索，但它们通常在集成阶段采用固定策略，而未能适应特定任务的特征。为了解决这个问题，

Method: 我们提出了PSEO，一个用于事后堆叠集成优化的框架。首先，我们通过二元二次规划进行基本模型选择，并在多样性和性能之间进行权衡。此外，我们引入了两种机制来充分发挥多层堆叠的潜力。最后，PSEO构建了一个超参数空间，并在其中搜索最佳的事后集成策略。

Result: PSEO实现了最佳平均测试排名（2.96）。

Conclusion: PSEO在80个公共数据集上的实证结果表明，在包括最近AutoML系统中的post-hoc设计和最先进的集成学习方法在内的16种方法中，		实现了最佳平均测试排名（2.96）。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的个性化联邦学习框架pFedDSH，该框架基于中心超网络，通过无数据重放策略和批处理特定的掩码，解决了动态客户端加入场景中的知识保留和转移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的个性化联邦学习(pFL)方法都假设静态客户端参与，这不能反映新客户端可能不断加入联邦系统(即动态客户端加入)的真实场景。本文探讨了一种实际场景，即在学习任务保持不变的情况下，以增量方式引入一批新的客户端。这种动态环境带来了各种挑战，包括在不重新训练的情况下保持现有客户端的性能，以及实现客户端批次之间的高效知识转移。

Method: 基于中心超网络的个性化联邦无数据子超网络(pFedDSH)，通过嵌入向量为每个客户端生成个性化模型。为了保持现有客户端的知识稳定性，pFedDSH结合了批处理特定的掩码，激活神经元的子集以保持知识。此外，我们引入了一种受DeepInversion启发的无数据重放策略，以促进后向迁移，在不损害隐私的情况下提高现有客户端的性能。

Result: pFedDSH在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上优于最先进的pFL和联邦持续学习基线。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上优于最先进的pFL和联邦持续学习基线，实现了现有客户端的鲁棒性能稳定性、新客户端的适应性以及神经资源的有效利用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Motivation: EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under energy-efficiency constraints

Method: a novel spiking symmetric mixing framework

Result: S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoding accuracy, parameter reduction by 14.7$\times$, a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution for AAD tasks.

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

Motivation: 将LLM与用户偏好对齐对于实际应用至关重要，但这通常需要昂贵的微调或昂贵的推理，从而迫使在对齐质量和计算成本之间进行权衡。现有的推理时方法通常忽略这种平衡，而只关注优化策略的性能。

Method: HIA（启发式引导的推理时对齐），一种无需调整、黑盒兼容的方法，它使用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤来减少推理调用，同时保持对齐质量。

Result: 在真实世界的提示数据集HelpSteer和ComPRed上，在相同的推理预算下，HIA在多目标、目标条件任务中优于best-of-N抽样、集束搜索和贪婪搜索基线。

Conclusion: HIA在低推理预算下有效，为可扩展的个性化LLM部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Result: The HAR model showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively. For everyday activities, the proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high performance across 9 smartphone wear locations, outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical applicability.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS

showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

Motivation: 传统的完整展开 (FR) 方法通常无法捕获因果依赖关系，并且在训练时间范围之外的泛化能力较差。自回归 (AR) 方法在逐步演化系统时，会受到误差累积的影响，从而限制了长期准确性。这些缺点限制了这两种策略的长期准确性和可靠性。

Method: 引入了物理信息时间积分深度算子网络 (PITI-DeepONet)，这是一种双输出架构，通过完全物理信息或混合物理和数据驱动的目标进行训练，以确保稳定、准确的长期演化，远超出训练范围。

Result: 应用于基准问题时，与传统方法相比，PITI-DeepONet 在扩展的推理时间范围内显示出更高的准确性。一维热方程的平均相对$\mathcal{L}_2$误差降低了 84%（对比 FR）和 79%（对比 AR）；一维 Burgers 方程降低了 87%（对比 FR）和 98%（对比 AR）；二维 Allen-Cahn 方程降低了 42%（对比 FR）和 89%（对比 AR）。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet 通过超越经典的 FR 和 AR 方案，为更可靠地长期整合复杂的时间相关偏微分方程铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.
