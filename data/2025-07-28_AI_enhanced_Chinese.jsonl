To\ndate, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with\nincomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4\nenvironment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as\npossible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving\nforward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact\nforces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under\npartial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,\ndespite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,\nthe policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in\nbody part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that\nprocesses a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated\ninto a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par\nwith fully observed baselines.

Many\napproaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying\nskills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.\nThese conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that\nassume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks\nannotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated\nas signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in\nannotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model\nthat incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy\nannotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic\ndisagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at\nrecovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than\ntraditional aggregation methods.

In this paper, we present an\nincremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to\naddress entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse\nconnections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a\nweighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing\nTKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global\ndefinition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood\nproximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in\ntraining accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We\nevaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link\nprediction, and in addressing long-tail entities.

With\nrecent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate\ntheir capability to automate this process.

To address these issues, we introduce\nREPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social\nscience paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are\ntasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original\npaper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features\nend-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers\nwith complexity comparable to real-world assessments.

In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel\nregularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in\ngraph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as\nLightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics.

However, the traditional centralized\nlearning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and\ntrained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized\napproaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing\nmodel training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these\nmethods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data\nand suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the\naggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of\nclinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously\nlearning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and\ndecentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system\nexpansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data.

To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30\ndatasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved\nan overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and\nswarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions\ndue to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated\nstrong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after\nexpansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its\nresilience to catastrophic forgetting.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured.

The latent FM model further improves\nthe inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a\nminimal trade-off in accuracy.

The first part reviews recent\nfindings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,\nincluding Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also\nhighlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true\nunderstanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys\nemerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on\nsystem architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such\nas Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of\ntheir design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.\nParticular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,\ncalibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The\nfinal section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box\nsystems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious\ngames-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or\npredictive modeling.

Neural radiance\nfield (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting\nof implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving\nscenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through\nrasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,\npreventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both\nNeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit\nnetworks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing\ninteroperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present\nSparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports\nrasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D\nvoxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast\ntraining (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS\nLiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,\nand can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that\nSaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods\nwhile improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable\nsimulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5SaLF\uff0c\u5b83\u6bd4NeRF\u548c3DGS\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff08NeRF\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u6295\u5c04\u91cd\u5efa\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u30023D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff083DGS\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6805\u5316\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u9488\u5b54\u76f8\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u6b62\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\uff08SaLF\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u652f\u6301\u5149\u6805\u5316\u548c\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002SaLF\u5c06\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u76843D\u4f53\u7d20\u56fe\u5143\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f53\u7d20\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u3002", "result": "SaLF\u5177\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08<30\u5206\u949f\uff09\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u76f8\u673a50+ FPS\u548cLiDAR 600+ FPS\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u975e\u9488\u5b54\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u65cb\u8f6cLiDAR\u3002", "conclusion": "SaLF\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC\nof 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity\nof 0.798.

Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was\nintegrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing\nclinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty.

We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the\nCharacter Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with\n77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for\nl\\\"ul\\\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER\nof 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve\na well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.\nUsing a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust\nperformance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the\nKuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing\nsuzipu, l\\\"ul\\\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the\ndigitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural\ndiversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music\ntraditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u300a\u767d\u77f3\u9053\u4eba\u6b4c\u66f2\u300b\u4e2d\u82cf\u5b57\u8c31\u548c\u5f8b\u5415\u8c31\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u97f3\u4e50\u8bc6\u522b(OMR)\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u6587\u4e50\u8c31\uff08\u5982\u82cf\u5b57\u8c31\u548c\u5f8b\u5415\u8c31\uff09\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u97f3\u4e50\u8bc6\u522b(OMR)\u7531\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7559\u4e00\u7248\u672c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u82cf\u5b57\u8c31\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387(CER)\u4ece10.4%\u964d\u4f4e\u52307.1%\uff0c\u5f8b\u5415\u8c31\u7684CER\u8fbe\u52300.9%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u768415.9%\u5e73\u5747CER\u548c7.6%\u6700\u4f73CER\u3002\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee(ECE)\u4f4e\u4e8e0.0162\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u300a\u767d\u77f3\u9053\u4eba\u6b4c\u66f2\u300b\u4e2d\u82cf\u5b57\u8c31\u548c\u5f8b\u5415\u8c31\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u97f3\u4e50\u8bc6\u522b(OMR)\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u3002"}}

While graph neural networks\n(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on\nmolecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information\ncrucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric\nmulti-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework\nthat enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly\nincorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our\nmodel constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the\nspatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We\nevaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and\nregression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust\nassessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN\nconsistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior\nperformance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC\nof 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of\n0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified\nthe impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's\npredictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,\nbut chemically significant, functional motifs.

Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the\nexisting binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.\nTherefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture\nthat denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask\nrepresentations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.\nWe evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and\nCARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal\nnavigable corridors in the image.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a self-supervised approach, ContourDiff, for predicting drivable free-space corridors from monocular images by leveraging future ego-trajectories and a diffusion-based architecture that denoises over contour points.", "motivation": "Existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain.

Videos and images\ngenerated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more\ndifficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new\nmodels to detect artificially-generated media.

This paper introduces an approach of using\nsolely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of\nboth deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an\napproach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on\nidentifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image\nprocessing.

In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel\nadversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and\nundefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)\nrepresentations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting\npoint clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point\nclouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,\nMAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain\neffective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting\nand prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the\noptimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and\nundefendability.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm.

The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm\nof imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to\ncapture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation\nfor clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned\nembedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some\nattributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we\nestablish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable\nRefinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated\nto reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the\nsampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation\nnodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters.

In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM.

We argue\nthat the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer\nlearning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,\nscalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt\noptimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn\nhigh-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or\nmore LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool\ncalls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose\nproblems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons\nfrom the Pareto frontier of its own attempts.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding.

As a result, established platforms in other\ndomains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to\nengage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of\nthese experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI\ninnovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms\nactively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new\nchallenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video\nexperience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences\nintroduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when\noptimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos.

In medicine, these models can admit\nconflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly\nunderstood and insufficiently addressed.\n  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications\nof predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model\narchitectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate\npredictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard\nvalidation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a\nsubstantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model\ndevelopment.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.
