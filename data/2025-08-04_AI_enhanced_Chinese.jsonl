Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic\ncomplexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across\ninterpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --\nespecially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating\nsemiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems\nepistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity.

When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural\nlanguage help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by\na dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts\nself-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into\nconcise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.\nBesides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent\nknowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its\nability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,\ndata-driven process as \\textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent\nincrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing\nmodel parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging\nknowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,\nMetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or\nexceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving\nagentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,\ngames, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory\nimprovable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete\nsignal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended\nhyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box\nevaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for\nGPU-scalable experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86POBAX\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5fc5\u8981\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u9700\u8981\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6df7\u53e0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7279\u5f81\u5c4f\u853d\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u906e\u6321\u6216\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e94\u8be5\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff1a1. \u8986\u76d6\u5176\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u30022. \u5177\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u6216\u66f4\u5c11\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u5927\u81f4\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u73af\u5883\u662f\u53ef\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\uff1a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u81ea\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93POBAX\uff1aJAX\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "POBAX\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5efa\u56fe\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "POBAX\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5305\u542b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u5efa\u56fe\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u5f00\u7bb1\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728JAX\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eGPU\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002"}}

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

They are often biased,\nunreliable, and unfit to define \"ground truth.\" Yet, given the surging need to\nproduce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,\ntraditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain\ncentral to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better\nposition to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved\nstudent learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We\nalso emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by\nestablishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it\nworks across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints).

Predictive models,\ntrained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31\nindependent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics\n(R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and\nMann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified\nindividual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators\nsignificantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme\nmarket fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly\nsignificant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics,\nespecially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as\ndominant predictors.

We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric\nin a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental\nsub-goals it will likely imply.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0", "summary": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use.

Method: We\npropose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured\nclinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct\nClinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines\nfor three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute\npancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head\nIdentification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's\netiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we\nintroduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds\netiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected\nEtiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided\nLoss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework\nimproves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning\nFocus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant\nDiagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that\nour models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex\nscenarios.

The\ncurrent literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning\nmodels to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high\nmisclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational\nexpense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these\ndrawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked\nensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses\nadvanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model\nrobustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal\nwith class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an\nensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose\ncomplementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model.

Despite its standardized format and small file size, the\nhigh complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a\n60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep\nlearning models, especially when only small training datasets are available.\nThis study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods\nfrom representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nand Autoencoders to reduce data complexity.

Although reinforcement\nlearning (RL) offers a solution to optimize longer-term goals, such as\nin-session engagement, applying it at web scale is challenging due to the\nextremely large action space and engineering complexity. In this paper, we\nintroduce RecoMind, a simulator-based RL framework designed for the effective\noptimization of session-based goals at web-scale. RecoMind leverages existing\nrecommendation models to establish a simulation environment and to bootstrap\nthe RL policy to optimize immediate user interactions from the outset. This\nmethod integrates well with existing industry pipelines, simplifying the\ntraining and deployment of RL policies. Additionally, RecoMind introduces a\ncustom exploration strategy to efficiently explore web-scale action spaces with\nhundreds of millions of items. We evaluated RecoMind through extensive offline\nsimulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform.

However,\ndetecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in\nreal-world settings where facial data from different individuals is\ndecentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nfor drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with\nheterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial\nSelf-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetwork to better extract key facial features and improve detection\nperformance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity\nComparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different\noperators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the\nglobal model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool\nthat automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and\ncropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,\nflipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that\nour framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning\nsettings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling\nreal-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in\nintelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and\nreliable drowsiness detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7761\u610f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u5206\u6563\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 89.9% \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u75b2\u52b3\u662f\u9053\u8def\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u7761\u610f\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b (SSA) \u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6 (LSTM) \u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83 (GSC)\uff0c\u8be5\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u805a\u5408\u4e4b\u524d\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5904\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 89.9% \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 89.9% \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56f0\u5026\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it\nanticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe\nstates, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted\nrisk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard\nextensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and\nautonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early\non up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes\n(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to\n80.4% task completion.

Unlike frame-based\ncameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,\ncapturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based\nmethods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully\nexploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.\nTherefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement\npipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure\nrefinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with\namplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude\nand phase components in Fourier space.

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag\nassumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex\nsystems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline.

Under the setting of online convex optimization, several\nalgorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.\nHowever, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only\nhandle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,\nwhich hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,\nwhich automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially\nconcave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary\nor changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual\nadaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and\naggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a\nsecond-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further\nincorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing\nenvironments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies\n(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to\nachieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able\nto minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions\nsimultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.\nMoreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,\nand develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of\ncomposite functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u88ab\u52a8\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7761\u7720\u4e13\u5bb6\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u79cd\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5141\u8bb8\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u56de\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u79cd\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5141\u8bb8\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u56de\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002\u8fd8\u5c06\u5143\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u590d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u590d\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\u503c\u3002"}}

The latest methods are either generalization-based\nor overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not\ngeneralize well on views that were unseen during training, while the\nreconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the\nlimited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel\nneural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume\nrendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.\nFirstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the\nneural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by\ninsufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and\nsmoothness in the reconstruction results.

But, similarly to other forms,\ntabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious\nperformance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the\nmost effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the\nunder-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed\nGAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the\nreal data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,\nthe class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical\nvariables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less\neffective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a\nconditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,\nctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input\nsamples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a\nnovel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes\nboth cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to\ngenerate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data\ndistribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,\nyet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature\nmodes without affecting data dimensionality.

Faced with real-world\ngraphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences,\ntermed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection\npipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual\ninformation into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks\nwithin the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding\nprocess is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph\ndomain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus\non GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.\nHow to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast\npotential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging\nissue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed\ngraph anomaly detection, named CMUCL. We simultaneously model data from both\ntext and graph structures, and jointly train text and graph encoders by\nleveraging cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency to uncover\npotential anomaly-related information. Accordingly, we design an anomaly score\nestimator based on inconsistency mining to derive node-specific anomaly scores.\nConsidering the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for anomaly detection on\nTAGs, we release 8 datasets to facilitate future research.

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories.

To address this, we propose a\ntwo-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite\nmining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nfor each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to\ndiscard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing\nbackground noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral\nsmoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection,\nand second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In\nthe second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where\nKMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed\nby non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing.

However, training these models to\ngeneralize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions\nin proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.\nHere, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large\ndatasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural\nnetwork architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT\nPESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions.

Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection\ncapabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English\ndatasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese\ncontext.

DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAEDAL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (DLLM) \u7684\u65b0\u9896\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (DLLM) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6b63\u5728\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d6\u4ee3\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cDLLM \u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u9759\u6001\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u964d\u566a\u7b56\u7565 DAEDAL\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728 DLLM \u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAEDAL \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ee4\u724c\u6bd4\u7387\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DAEDAL \u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u957f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u4e86 DLLM \u7684\u65b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features.

Existing\nmethods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to\ngenerate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited\nunderstanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach\nthat uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional\ninpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints\nfrom human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:\nthe primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the\nsecondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional\ninpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions\nwithin a diffusion model.

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,\nDP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised\nadaptation in target domains.

However, most existing GDA methods rely\non the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world\nscenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely\nimpairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain\nshifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeGPR \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ea7\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cc\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 GDA \u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6e90\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce8\u91ca\u566a\u58f0\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5f88\u5c11\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "NeGPR \u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cNeGPR \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "NeGPR \u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0cNeGPR \u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 12.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "NeGPR\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 12.7%\u3002"}}

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,\ndetecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across\ntimepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS\nscore. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics\nclinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and\nBIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)\nblock that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;\nand (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent\nspace alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding\ndomain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house\nlongitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%\nin terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute\ncomplementary performance gains.

Existing external safeguards fall into\ntwo types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I\nmodel-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image\nfilters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly\nand introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems\nlike Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a\nU-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)\nearly denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)\ncross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image\nregions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW\ndetection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising\nsteps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong\noperates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting\nfor full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,\nseeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two\npublic benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms\ntext-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while\noffering much greater efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wukong\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2dNSFW\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u66b4\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u793e\u533a\u51c6\u5219\u3002\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u68c0\u6d4bNSFW\u5185\u5bb9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Wukong\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684NSFW\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528U-Net\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "Wukong\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Wukong\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5927\u5927\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

However, due to the complexity of\nthe process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading\nremains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we\npresent a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is\nexplicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment\nbetween reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training\nobjective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like\nlook, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our\nLUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural\ndetails in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We\nfurther build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for\nlow-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.\nExperimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach for video color grading.

In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework\nthat combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the\nGPU memory footprint.

(2) We\npropose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best\nmemory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training\ntensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the\npolicy during training to enhance throughput.
