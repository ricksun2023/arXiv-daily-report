Although some approaches\nhave started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,\nthe issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant\nproblems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address\nthese challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive\nMulti-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),\naiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive\nConversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide\nrange of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive\nlearning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate\ninformative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic\nuser-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that\nHyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively\nalleviating unfairness.

A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization", "comment": null, "summary": "Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value\nin customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization\ntasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically\nLong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and\nDeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent\nabstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive\nand systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning\nLLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented\ndialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary\nlengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and\nadvanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and\nhuman-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,\nour findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently\nimprove dialogue summarization quality.

Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer", "comment": null, "summary": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language\nmodels to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in\nstandard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in\nnatural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To\ncapture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have\nexplored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent\nspace, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether\nsuch reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer\nthat reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We\nexamine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of\nprobing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal\nlimited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of\nfinal and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant\nprobing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of\nhidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.\nFinally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only\nmarginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize\nreasoning steps.

Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these\ndifferent analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such\ndiscrepancies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u97f3\u4e50\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5185\u5bb9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b4c\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u97f3\u4e50\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6b4c\u66f2\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7528\u6237\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6536\u542c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6765\u63a8\u8350\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u97f3\u4e50\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u79cd\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6536\u542c\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u66f2\u76ee\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u5185\u5bb9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6b4c\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u5185\u5bb9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u6b4c\u66f2\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6b4c\u66f2\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6b4c\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u7c7b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While GDC users can interactively\ncreate complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially\nnew ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of\npossible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe\ntheir desired cohort in free-text natural language.\n  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for\ncurating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the\nGDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of\ntheir desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further\nanalysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the\ngenerated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)\nfor GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC\nCohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC\ncohorts.\n  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort\nCopilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/uc-cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for\nCER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static\nand dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,\nand text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,\nour approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image\nPretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene\nunderstanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)\nmodule that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a\nCompound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability\nAggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods\nto produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus\ntraining, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%\non Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via\nzero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches\ntrained on target data.

While recent research has increasingly\nincorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential\nto enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,\ndesigning effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a\nbarrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nSciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific\npapers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA\nselection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA\ngeneration. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms.

We\ndemonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the\nmost relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with\nrecent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,\nshowing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our\nmethod shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's\ncontext window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach\nusing a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference\nwith a 700K context window by 2.8 points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e27\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587 VLM \u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u7ea6 1000 \u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u5e27\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u65f6\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728 LVBench \u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7 1 \u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u8f83\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 32K \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528 700K \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u540c VLM 2.8 \u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data\nefficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely\non 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still\nrequire weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer\nfrom a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a\nstep change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet\nprecise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although\nmany adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of\ndifferent conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.\nWe study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object\ndetection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and\nlayout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning\nyields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning\nbecomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,\nsynthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four\npercent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using\nreal data alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ec5\u4ece\u5c11\u6570\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u662f\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6570\u6708\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u653e\u7f6e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684 80 \u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u8f83\u7a84\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u5e03\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747 34%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 177%\u3002"}}

Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86GCN\u7684\u6838\u5916SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc (GCN) \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 (PPI) \u5230\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5728 GCN \u4e2d\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u5e7f\u4e49\u77e9\u9635-\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5 (SpGEMM)\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d GPU \u5185\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\uff0cSpGEMM \u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u6838\u5916\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7 GPU \u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u6df7\u5408 CPU-GPU \u5185\u5b58\u5e03\u5c40\u6216\u4ee5\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6838\u5916 SpGEMM \u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8 I/O \u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c GPU \u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f GCN \u7684\u6838\u5916 SpGEMM \u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\uff0cAIRES \u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u5757\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u94fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u5757\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\uff0cAIRES \u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u96c6\u6210 GPU \u5185\u5b58\u3001GPU Direct Storage (GDS) \u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11 I/O \u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 1.8 \u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 1.8 \u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables\nflexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks\nwithout modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that\nthe proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric\ninductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during\nadaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse\ngeometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph\ncontrol, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,\nmolecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation.

To address these\nissues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement\noccupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame\n3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a\nfeature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow\nMatching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and\nPlane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the\nimpact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall\nefficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,\nwe design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and\naddress the issue of sensor data loss.

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6307\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06SAM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f(RS)\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u63d0\u793a(\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u70b9\u6216\u6846)\u662f\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6563\u5206\u5e03\u7684RS\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0cSAM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7RS\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5206\u5272\u65b0\u7684\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u3002", "method": "ViRefSAM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6307\u5bfcSAM\u3002ViRefSAM\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u7c7b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff1b(2) \u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230SAM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u7c7b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f7fSAM\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(\u5305\u62eciSAID-5$^i$\u3001LoveDA-2$^i$\u548cCOCO-20$^i$)\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cViRefSAM\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples.

We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition.

To address these challenges, we\npropose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework\nthat integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and\nevaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function\nuncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free\nidentification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward\ncomponents. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization\n(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance\nhyperparameter configuration efficiency.

URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between\nthe reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths\nof the Bayesian Optimization.

Specifically, we\ncarefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement\nlearning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction\nfollowing.

To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations.

This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision.

Although these models\nhave unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not\noffer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is\ninherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders\nenables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering\nexplicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an\nencoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,\nwhich learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the\nlatent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the\nlatent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing\nregion-specific cellular patterns in brain images.

To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual.

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks.

However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions.

Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the\nhuman proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two\noptimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization\nframework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints\nbased on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to\nassist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our\nmethod is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos\ncaptured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo\nground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose\nestimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

We attribute\nthis issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.\nTo address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework\nthat decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,\nCanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity\nmodification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped\nfeature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the\npreservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve\nprecise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we\ndesign a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source\nidentity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial\nregions.

Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in\npost-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which\nare inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents\nof damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a\nnovel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation\nproblem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected\nareas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity\ndataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged\nstructures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a\nSegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake\nsocial media images.

Recent efforts extend these\nmodels to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for\nfine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have\nemerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.\nHowever, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and\nvisual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly\nfrom natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a\ncore limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to\naccount for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation\nduring denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature\ninjection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising\nprocess. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the\nmodel to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure\npreservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful\nstructural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and\na restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual\nquality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both\nstructure-rich and appearance-rich.
