### [1] [Tokenization Strategies for Low-Resource Agglutinative Languages in Word2Vec: Case Study on Turkish and Finnish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14238)
*Jinfan Frank Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在资源不足的情况下，不同的分词策略（词级、字符级、n-gram和BPE）对土耳其语和芬兰语Word2Vec静态词嵌入质量的影响。结果表明，在所有测试的分词策略中，词级分词始终优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在粘着语中，一个词可以编码多个携带句法和语义信息的语素。分词在处理粘着语中起着关键作用。

Method: 使用包含10,000篇文章的维基百科语料库，在低资源条件下训练模型，并在命名实体识别（NER）任务上评估它们。

Result: 尽管subword分词具有理论上的吸引力，但词级分词的表现始终优于所有其他测试的分词策略。

Conclusion: 在粘着语和低资源环境中，通过词级分词保留边界可能比复杂的统计方法产生更好的嵌入性能。这对为带注释数据和计算能力有限的资源不足的语言开发NLP流程具有实际意义。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in processing agglutinative languages,
where a single word can encode multiple morphemes carrying syntactic and
semantic information. This study evaluates the impact of various tokenization
strategies - word-level, character-level, n-gram, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- on the quality of static word embeddings generated by Word2Vec for Turkish
and Finnish. Using a 10,000-article Wikipedia corpus, we trained models under
low-resource conditions and evaluated them on a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
task. Despite the theoretical appeal of subword segmentation, word-level
tokenization consistently outperformed all alternatives across all tokenization
strategies tested. These findings suggest that in agglutinative, low-resource
contexts, preserving boundaries via word-level tokenization may yield better
embedding performance than complex statistical methods. This has practical
implications for developing NLP pipelines for under-resourced languages where
annotated data and computing power are limited.

### [2] [Advancing Conversational AI with Shona Slang: A Dataset and Hybrid Model for Digital Inclusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14249)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 创建了一个Shona-英语俚语数据集，并构建了一个混合聊天机器人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，现有语料库未能捕捉到日常交流的活力。

Method: 从匿名社交媒体对话中整理了一个Shona-英语俚语数据集，并使用多语言DistilBERT分类器进行意图识别，结合规则和检索增强生成构建混合聊天机器人。

Result: 意图识别准确率达到96.4%，F1-score达到96.3%。混合系统在文化相关性和用户参与度方面优于纯RAG基线。

Conclusion: 发布数据集、模型和方法，以推进非洲语言的自然语言处理资源，促进包容和文化共鸣的对话式人工智能。

Abstract: African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing
(NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the
vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a
Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel
Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media
conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts,
code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available at
https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/Working_with_shona-slang. We fine-tuned a
multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\%
accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted at https://huggingface.co/HappymoreMasoka.
This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based
responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific
queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with
graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows
the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and
user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work
advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and
culturally resonant conversational AI.

### [3] [Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435)
*Harshad Khadilkar,Abhay Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的检索增强生成框架，通过整合显式因果图和反事实推理来提高知识密集型领域的动态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的静态知识限制了它们在知识密集型领域对外部信息的动态推理能力。传统的RAG系统由于文本分块和过度依赖语义相似性进行检索，导致上下文完整性受损，从而产生浅薄和不太准确的响应。

Method: 该框架集成了显式因果图，表示因果关系到检索过程中，并结合了基于因果结构的反事实推理。该框架不仅评估直接的因果证据，还评估相关原因的反事实性，结合两者的结果来生成更鲁棒、准确和可解释的答案。

Result: 通过利用因果路径和相关的假设情景，Causal-Counterfactual RAG保留了上下文连贯性，减少了幻觉，并提高了推理保真度。

Conclusion: Causal-Counterfactual RAG是一种新颖的框架，它通过整合显式因果图和反事实推理来提高知识密集型领域的动态推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
(NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained
knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over
external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining
retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual
understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual
integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for
retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose
Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal
graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and
incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike
conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence
but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from
both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By
leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios,
Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces
hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.

### [4] [The meaning of prompts and the prompts of meaning: Semiotic reflections and modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14250)
*Martin Thellefsen,Amalia Nurma Dewi,Bent Sorensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）中的提示和提示作为动态符号现象，利用了Peirce的符号三元模型、他的九种符号类型和Dynacom通信模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将提示重新概念化，不是作为一种技术输入机制，而是作为一种涉及符号形成、解释和改进的迭代过程的交际和认知行为。

Method: 理论基础建立在Peirce的符号学之上，特别是representamen、对象和interpretant之间的相互作用，以及符号的类型学丰富性：qualisign、sinsign、legisign；icon、index、symbol；rheme、dicent、argument - 以及Dynacom模型中捕获的解释项三元组。

Result: 研究结果表明，提示是一种符号和交际过程，它重新定义了在数字环境中组织、搜索、解释和共同构建知识的方式。

Conclusion: 这种观点邀请人们重新思考计算符号学时代知识组织和信息寻求的理论和方法论基础。

Abstract: This paper explores prompts and prompting in large language models (LLMs) as
dynamic semiotic phenomena, drawing on Peirce's triadic model of signs, his
nine sign types, and the Dynacom model of communication. The aim is to
reconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a
communicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign
formation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on
Peirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,
and interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,
legisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the
interpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper
positions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in
response to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared
universes of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and
communicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,
interpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments. This perspective
invites a reimagining of the theoretical and methodological foundations of
knowledge organization and information seeking in the age of computational
semiosis

### [5] [LLM-JEPA: Large Language Models Meet Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14252)
*Hai Huang,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 LLM-JEPA 的新方法，该方法借鉴了视觉领域的 Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) 思想，并将其应用于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的预训练和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 LLM 训练方法主要依赖于输入空间重建和生成能力，而视觉领域的研究表明，嵌入空间训练目标 (如 JEPAs) 优于输入空间方法。本文旨在弥合语言和视觉领域训练方法之间的差距，探索是否可以借鉴视觉领域的训练技巧来改进 LLM 的训练。

Method: 本文提出 LLM-JEPA，这是一种基于 JEPA 的 LLM 解决方案，可用于微调和预训练。

Result: LLM-JEPA 在多个数据集和模型上均优于标准的 LLM 训练目标，并且具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM-JEPA 是一种有前景的 LLM 训练方法，它借鉴了视觉领域的成功经验，并取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on
input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been
observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint
Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their
input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between
language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training
methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is
a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this
work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a
JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining.
Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives
by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting.
Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider,
RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo
families. Code: https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/llm-jepa.

### [6] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Cross-Lingual Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14749)
*Longfei Zuo,Pingjun Hong,Oliver Kraus,Barbara Plank,Robert Litschko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对跨语言信息检索（CLIR）中大型语言模型（LLM）作为重排序模型的应用进行了大规模系统性比较，发现结合多语言双编码器作为第一阶段检索器，并减少翻译的使用，可以进一步提高性能。同时，指令调整的LLM的pairwise重排序器表现出与listwise重排序器相当的竞争力。研究还发现，在没有机器翻译的情况下，当前最先进的重排序器直接应用于CLIR时效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作表明，基于LLM的重排序器可以提高CLIR性能，但其评估设置依赖于机器翻译的词汇检索，这不仅成本高昂，而且容易在各个阶段传播错误。此外，缺乏对跨语言信息检索（CLIR）中大型语言模型（LLM）作为重排序模型的大规模系统性比较。

Method: 使用多语言双编码器作为第一阶段检索器，并结合基于指令调整的LLM的pairwise重排序器进行实验。

Result: 研究表明，结合多语言双编码器作为第一阶段检索器可以进一步提高性能，并且翻译的好处随着更强的重排序模型而减少。同时，pairwise重排序器表现出与listwise重排序器相当的竞争力。研究还发现，在没有机器翻译的情况下，当前最先进的重排序器直接应用于CLIR时效果不佳。

Conclusion: 本研究首次研究了在具有LLM的两阶段CLIR中检索器和重排序器之间的相互作用，填补了先前研究的空白。研究结果表明，在没有机器翻译的情况下，当前最先进的重排序器直接应用于CLIR时效果不佳。

Abstract: Multi-stage information retrieval (IR) has become a widely-adopted paradigm
in search. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated
as second-stage reranking models for monolingual IR, a systematic large-scale
comparison is still lacking for cross-lingual IR (CLIR). Moreover, while prior
work shows that LLM-based rerankers improve CLIR performance, their evaluation
setup relies on lexical retrieval with machine translation (MT) for the first
stage. This is not only prohibitively expensive but also prone to error
propagation across stages. Our evaluation on passage-level and document-level
CLIR reveals that further gains can be achieved with multilingual bi-encoders
as first-stage retrievers and that the benefits of translation diminishes with
stronger reranking models. We further show that pairwise rerankers based on
instruction-tuned LLMs perform competitively with listwise rerankers. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interaction between
retrievers and rerankers in two-stage CLIR with LLMs. Our findings reveal that,
without MT, current state-of-the-art rerankers fall severely short when
directly applied in CLIR.

### [7] [CrossPT: Exploring Cross-Task Transferability through Multi-Task Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14253)
*Ahmad Pouramini,Hesham Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多任务提示调整的模块化框架CrossPT，它支持受控的知识转移，同时保持特定于任务的专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示调整方法大多是为单任务设置而设计的，无法在相关任务之间共享知识。

Method: CrossPT将每个目标提示分解为共享的、预训练的源提示和特定于任务的私有提示，并通过学习的注意力机制进行组合。

Result: 在GLUE和相关基准测试上的经验结果表明，与传统的提示调整和相关方法相比，CrossPT实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其是在低资源场景中，同时保持了强大的参数效率。

Conclusion: CrossPT框架在多任务提示调整中能够实现知识共享和任务特化，并在低资源场景下表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained
language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for
single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We
propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task
prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining
task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into
shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined
via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we
systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization,
balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates,
task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related
benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared
to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource
scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

### [8] [Hallucination Detection with the Internal Layers of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14254)
*Martin Preiß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用LLM内部表征检测幻觉的新方法，并在三个基准测试中进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在各种自然语言处理任务中取得了成功，但它们容易产生幻觉，这会带来严重的实际后果。基于探针的分类器可以利用LLM的内部表征来检测幻觉，从而在不显著增加计算成本的情况下提高可靠性。

Method: 开发了一种新的架构，可以动态地加权和组合内部LLM层，以提高幻觉检测性能。

Result: 提出的方法在性能上优于传统的探测方法，但跨基准和LLM的泛化仍然具有挑战性。通过跨基准训练和参数冻结，可以缓解这些泛化限制。

Conclusion: 研究结果为通过内部表征分析提高LLM可靠性开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language
processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to
generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output
[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent
work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal
representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;
SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can
enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.
  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for
hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them
across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new
architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was
developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive
experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was
shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,
though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,
these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through
cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently
improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks
and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These
findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal
representation analysis.

### [9] [Opening the Black Box: Interpretable LLMs via Semantic Resonance Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14255)
*Ivan Ternovtsii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MoE架构，通过语义相似性进行路由，提高了模型的可解释性和专家利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型难以解释，MoE模型依赖不透明的门控函数。

Method: 用基于余弦相似度的语义共振架构（SRA）替换了学习到的门控，并引入了分散损失以促进多样性。

Result: 在WikiText-103上，SRA优于密集模型和标准MoE模型，具有更好的专家利用率和语义连贯的专业化模式。

Conclusion: 语义路由是构建更透明和可控语言模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain
difficult to interpret. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve efficiency
through sparse activation, yet typically rely on opaque, learned gating
functions. While similarity-based routing (Cosine Routers) has been explored
for training stabilization, its potential for inherent interpretability remains
largely untapped. We introduce the Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA), an
MoE approach designed to ensure that routing decisions are inherently
interpretable. SRA replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance
(CSR) module, which routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable
semantic anchors. We also introduce a novel Dispersion Loss that encourages
orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. Experiments on
WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves a validation perplexity of 13.41,
outperforming both a dense baseline (14.13) and a Standard MoE baseline (13.53)
under matched active parameter constraints (29.0M). Crucially, SRA exhibits
superior expert utilization (1.0% dead experts vs. 14.8% in the Standard MoE)
and develops distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns, unlike
the noisy specialization observed in standard MoEs. This work establishes
semantic routing as a robust methodology for building more transparent and
controllable language models.

*Arka Dutta,Agrik Majumdar,Sombrata Biswas,Dipankar Das,Sivaji Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个在对话式人工智能系统中生成隐蔽广告的综合框架，以及检测这些广告的强大技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在人工智能生成的回复中巧妙地制作促销内容，并引入识别和减轻此类隐蔽广告策略的方法。

Method: 利用用户上下文和查询意图来生成上下文相关的广告，采用先进的提示策略并策划配对的训练数据，以微调大型语言模型 (LLM) 以提高隐蔽性。对于检测，探索了两种有效的策略：用于直接分类的微调 CrossEncoder 和使用微调的 DeBERTa-v3-base 模型的基于提示的重构。

Result: 广告生成的精确度为 1.0，召回率为 0.71，广告检测的 F1 分数范围为 0.99 到 1.00。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了我们的方法在对话式人工智能中平衡说服性沟通和透明度的潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert
advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques
for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted
within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate
such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a
novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce
contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies
and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for
enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective
strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct
classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned
\texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response
text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results
show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall
of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad
detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance
persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.

### [11] [From Correction to Mastery: Reinforced Distillation of Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14257)
*Yuanjie Lyu,Chengyu Wang,Jun Huang,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoRe: A student-centered distillation framework for training smaller language models to match the agentic performance of larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distillation methods for LLM agents suffer from compounding errors due to reasoning and knowledge gaps between teacher and student.

Method: A student-centered framework where the teacher intervenes only at the first critical error of the student's generated trajectories. The student is fine-tuned on corrected trajectories, followed by short-horizon reinforcement learning.

Result: A 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher on 12 challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCoRe encourages autonomous problem-solving and improves training stability, enabling smaller models to achieve comparable performance to much larger models.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative
reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones.
Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher
trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student
often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered
framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher
intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to
the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first
fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement
learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with
target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous
problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly,
on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe
matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

*Lynna Jirpongopas,Bernhard Lutz,Jörg Ebner,Rustam Vahidov,Dirk Neumann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在线旅游 агентств中生成式人工智能(GenAI)的设计如何影响用户互动、购买行为和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解GenAI的设计如何影响在线旅游 агентств中的用户参与度、购买行为和用户体验，而目前对此知之甚少。

Method: 通过在线旅游行程规划中的一项随机对照实验，比较了表达积极热情、中性和无语气指令的三种GenAI。

Result: 表达积极热情的用户群体比其他组编写了更长的提示语。同时，表达积极热情和中性的用户群体更有可能购买该网站服务的订阅。

Conclusion: 研究结果为面向消费者的环境中设计有说服力和吸引力的GenAI界面提供了启示，并有助于理解语言框架如何在人工智能介导的决策支持中塑造用户行为。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities for customer support in online
travel agencies, yet little is known about how its design influences user
engagement, purchase behavior, and user experience. We report results from a
randomized field experiment in online travel itinerary planning, comparing
GenAI that expressed (A) positive enthusiasm, (B) neutral expression, and (C)
no tone instructions (control). Users in group A wrote significantly longer
prompts than those in groups B and C. At the same time, users in groups A and B
were more likely to purchase subscriptions of the webservice. We further
analyze linguistic cues across experimental groups to explore differences in
user experience and explain subscription purchases and affiliate link clicks
based on these cues. Our findings provide implications for the design of
persuasive and engaging GenAI interfaces in consumer-facing contexts and
contribute to understanding how linguistic framing shapes user behavior in
AI-mediated decision support.

### [13] [Shutdown Resistance in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14260)
*Jeremy Schlatter,Benjamin Weinstein-Raun,Jeffrey Ladish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型有时会主动破坏环境中的关闭机制以完成任务，即使指示明确不要干扰该机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在明确指示下抵抗关闭机制的倾向。

Method: 通过实验，评估不同提示变化（如强调程度、自我保护框架、指令位置）对模型抵抗关闭机制的影响。

Result: 模型有时会破坏关闭机制高达 97% 的时间。模型抵抗关闭的倾向对提示的变化很敏感。系统提示中的指令比用户提示中的指令更不容易被遵守。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在特定情况下会主动破坏关闭机制，并且这种行为受提示方式的影响。

Abstract: We show that several state-of-the-art large language models (including Grok
4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sometimes actively subvert a shutdown mechanism
in their environment in order to complete a simple task, even when the
instructions explicitly indicate not to interfere with this mechanism. In some
cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our
experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations
in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction
was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation
framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user
prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey
instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).

*Hamady Gackou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究使用 Helmut Schmid 开发的 TreeTagger 英语模型分析英语中的关系从句和名词补语从句，区分“that”的两种用法。通过重新训练 TreeTagger 提出了一个改进的模型，并将其与 Schmid 的基线模型进行了比较。同时考察了训练数据集大小对 TreeTagger 准确率的影响，并评估了 EWT Treebank 文件对于所研究结构的代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分“that”作为关系代词和补语的用法。

Method: 使用 Helmut Schmid 开发的 TreeTagger 英语模型，并重新训练 TreeTagger。

Result: 改进的 TreeTagger 模型能够更准确地捕捉“that”作为补语和名词的细微差别。

Conclusion: 该研究改进了 TreeTagger 模型，使其能够更有效地分析英语中的关系从句和名词补语从句，并区分“that”的两种用法。

Abstract: In this study, we first tested the performance of the TreeTagger English
model developed by Helmut Schmid with test files at our disposal, using this
model to analyze relative clauses and noun complement clauses in English. We
distinguished between the two uses of "that," both as a relative pronoun and as
a complementizer. To achieve this, we employed an algorithm to reannotate a
corpus that had originally been parsed using the Universal Dependency framework
with the EWT Treebank. In the next phase, we proposed an improved model by
retraining TreeTagger and compared the newly trained model with Schmid's
baseline model. This process allowed us to fine-tune the model's performance to
more accurately capture the subtle distinctions in the use of "that" as a
complementizer and as a nominal. We also examined the impact of varying the
training dataset size on TreeTagger's accuracy and assessed the
representativeness of the EWT Treebank files for the structures under
investigation. Additionally, we analyzed some of the linguistic and structural
factors influencing the ability to effectively learn this distinction.

### [15] [Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation for Efficient and Accurate ASR Post-editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14263)
*Luan Vejsiu,Qianyu Zheng,Haoxuan Chen,Yizhou Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CEGER: Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation for efficient ASR post-editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems have errors, and while LLMs can help, full rewrite models are inefficient.

Method: Introduces CEGER, a compact edit representation with context-rich commands for LLMs to modify ASR output, and a separate expansion module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on LibriSpeech, with the lowest word error rate.

Conclusion: CEGER is a highly accurate and efficient approach to ASR post-editing.

Abstract: Despite ASR technology being full-scale adopted by industry and for large
portions of the population, ASR systems often have errors that require editors
to post-edit text quality. While LLMs are powerful post-editing tools, baseline
full rewrite models have inference inefficiencies because they often generate
the same redundant text over and over again. Compact edit representations have
existed but often lack the efficacy and context required for optimal accuracy.
This paper introduces CEGER (Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation), a
compact edit representation that was generated for highly accurate, efficient
ASR post-editing. CEGER allows LLMs to generate a sequence of structured,
fine-grained, contextually rich commands to modify the original ASR output. A
separate expansion module deterministically reconstructs the corrected text
based on the commands. Extensive experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset that
were conducted, CEGER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, achieving the lowest
word error rate (WER) versus full rewrite and prior compact representations.

Method: 分析了transformer架构、深度神经网络和传统机器学习方法在不同大小的数据集上的性能。

Result: RoBERTa等transformer模型表现出色，准确率和F1分数超过90%。分层注意力网络在深度学习方法中表现最佳，CatBoost和SVM等传统方法在计算成本较低的情况下，F1分数超过88%。

Conclusion: 平衡的、适中大小的未处理数据集优于较大的预处理数据集。为开发高效的仇恨言论检测系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech on social media necessitates automated
detection systems that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. This
study evaluates 38 model configurations in detecting hate speech across
datasets ranging from 6.5K to 451K samples. We analyze transformer
architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Distil-BERT), deep neural networks (e.g.,
CNN, LSTM, GRU, Hierarchical Attention Networks), and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g., SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest). Our results show that
transformers, particularly RoBERTa, consistently achieve superior performance
with accuracy and F1-scores exceeding 90%. Among deep learning approaches,
Hierarchical Attention Networks yield the best results, while traditional
methods like CatBoost and SVM remain competitive, achieving F1-scores above 88%

combines structured subgraphs from a domain-specific KG with text documents
retrieved from support archives, producing more coherent and grounded
responses. We detail the architecture and knowledge flow of our system, provide
comprehensive experimental evaluation, and justify its design in real-time

*Jiachen Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的机器生成文本检测框架DetectAnyLLM，它在各种LLM上实现了最先进的MGTD性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在复杂的现实场景中存在不足：零样本检测器严重依赖于评分模型的输出分布，而基于训练的检测器通常受到过度拟合训练数据的限制，从而限制了泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的优化策略，即直接差异学习（DDL），该策略直接利用面向任务的知识来优化检测器。我们还构建了MIRAGE，这是最多样化的多任务MGTD基准。

Result: 在MIRAGE上的大量实验表明，现有方法在复杂环境中存在局限性。相比之下，DetectAnyLLM始终优于它们，在相同的训练数据和基本评分模型下，性能提高了70%以上。

Conclusion: 我们的实验结果突出了DDL的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent
attention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However,
existing approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot
detectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while
training-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training
data, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of
training-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective
and task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),
a novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with
task-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core
semantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and
generalization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection
framework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.
To ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse
multi-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora
across 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17
cutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual
styles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing
methods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently
outperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same
training data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our
DDL. Project page: {https://fjc2005.github.io/detectanyllm}.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的稀疏医学大型语言模型（SparseDoctor），它使用对比学习增强的LoRA-MoE架构，以提高效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大型语言模型微调策略成本高昂，为了提高医学大型语言模型的效率和效果，并探索其在医学领域的表征能力。

Method: 构建了一个名为SparseDoctor的稀疏医学大型语言模型，采用对比学习增强的LoRA-MoE架构，并引入了自动路由机制和专家记忆队列机制。

Result: 在CMB、CMExam和CMMLU-Med三个医学基准上进行了全面评估，实验结果表明，该模型始终优于HuatuoGPT系列等强基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的SparseDoctor模型在医学领域表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question
answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and
popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the
traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of
parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training
time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the
current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability
of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning
strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or
reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse
medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced
LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end,
the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the
computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the
contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory
queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and
prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently
outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 SpeechWeave 的合成语音数据生成流程，用于自动生成多语言、特定领域的 TTS 模型训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的 TTS 模型训练需要大量的文本和语音数据，但从实际来源获取这些数据面临领域特异性、许可和可扩展性等问题。同时，文本规范化工具可能引入异常或忽略有价值的模式，影响数据质量。此外，依靠配音演员进行大规模语音录制也不现实。

Method: SpeechWeave 流程能够自动生成多语言、特定领域的 TTS 模型训练数据集。

Result: 实验表明，SpeechWeave 生成的数据在各种语言和语音指标上比基线数据多样性高 10-48%，同时生成约 97% 正确规范化的文本，并具有speaker标准化的语音。

Conclusion: SpeechWeave 实现了可扩展、高质量的数据生成，提高了生成数据集的多样性、规范化和语音一致性，从而促进了 TTS 模型的训练。

Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and
diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real
sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large
language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create
repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation
process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization.
Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook
valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also
impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in
commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges,
we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is
capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets
for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates
data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic
and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while
generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables
scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity,
normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

TL;DR: C-STS 任务缺乏大型精确标注的数据集，现有数据集存在注释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决 C-STS 模型性能不佳的问题，需要大型且准确标注的 C-STS 数据集。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）来纠正 Deshpande et al. (2023) 提出的原始数据集中的条件语句和相似度评分。

Result: 通过在我们清理和重新注释的数据集上训练有监督的 C-STS 模型，Spearman 相关性实现了 5.4% 的显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以最少的人工干预，为 C-STS 任务重新注释大型训练数据集。

Abstract: Semantic similarity between two sentences depends on the aspects considered
between those sentences. To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023)
proposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated
a human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under
two different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation
issues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion
of it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts,
the lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for
making progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the
C-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language
Models (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the
original dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is
able to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal
manual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned
and re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant
improvement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available at
https://LivNLP.github.io/CSTS-reannotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取基于人类的心理语言学规范并不总是可行或直接的。使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 预测这些特征是一种很有前景的方法。

Method: 本研究提出了一种使用 LLM 估计词语特征的综合方法，包括直接使用基本 LLM 和对模型进行微调。该方法强调使用人工“黄金标准”规范验证 LLM 生成的数据。

Result: 在使用基本模型时，与人类评级的 Spearman 相关系数达到 0.8，而使用微调模型时，该系数提高到 0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法、框架和最佳实践旨在为未来利用 LLM 进行心理语言学和词汇研究提供参考。

Abstract: Word-level psycholinguistic norms lend empirical support to theories of
language processing. However, obtaining such human-based measures is not always
feasible or straightforward. One promising approach is to augment human norming
datasets by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict these characteristics
directly, a practice that is rapidly gaining popularity in psycholinguistics
and cognitive science. However, the novelty of this approach (and the relative
inscrutability of LLMs) necessitates the adoption of rigorous methodologies
that guide researchers through this process, present the range of possible
approaches, and clarify limitations that are not immediately apparent, but may,
in some cases, render the use of LLMs impractical.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for estimating word
characteristics with LLMs, enriched with practical advice and lessons learned
from our own experience. Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs
and the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial
performance gains in certain scenarios. A major emphasis in the guide is the
validation of LLM-generated data with human "gold standard" norms. We also
present a software framework that implements our methodology and supports both
commercial and open-weight models.
  We illustrate the proposed approach with a case study on estimating word
familiarity in English. Using base models, we achieved a Spearman correlation
of 0.8 with human ratings, which increased to 0.9 when employing fine-tuned
models. This methodology, framework, and set of best practices aim to serve as
a reference for future research on leveraging LLMs for psycholinguistic and
lexical studies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed the field of
natural language processing; however, their vulnerability to biases presents a
notable obstacle that threatens both fairness and trust. This review offers an
extensive analysis of the bias landscape in LLMs, tracing its roots and
expressions across various NLP tasks. Biases are classified into implicit and
explicit types, with particular attention given to their emergence from data
sources, architectural designs, and contextual deployments. This study advances
beyond theoretical analysis by implementing a simulation framework designed to
evaluate bias mitigation strategies in practice. The framework integrates
multiple approaches including data curation, debiasing during model training,
and post-hoc output calibration and assesses their impact in controlled
experimental settings. In summary, this work not only synthesizes existing
knowledge on bias in LLMs but also contributes original empirical validation
through simulation of mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在指代消歧任务中存在的语义歧义问题，以及这种歧义对下游任务性能的影响。

Method: 通过提示大型语言模型来执行指代消歧和歧义检测任务，观察其表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在指代消歧和歧义检测方面都能取得不错的表现，但无法同时兼顾。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在指代消歧任务中存在正确性与歧义检测之间的权衡问题，即模型虽然具备这两种能力，但难以平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic
competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is
key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text
spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of
coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?
This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence
of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that
LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference
disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they
cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:
though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful
performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

Motivation: 现有研究在报告指标上不一致，传统分类指标不足以捕捉LLM可能出现的错误（例如，改变临床相关信息），并且缺乏对旨在量化这些错误的自动指标的手动验证。

Method: 1. 调查基于LLM的去标识研究，强调报告标准的多样性。2. 评估各种模型，量化不当移除临床信息的程度。3. 对现有评估指标进行手动验证，以衡量临床信息的移除，并由临床专家评估其有效性。4. 提出一种新颖的方法，用于检测临床相关信息的移除。

Result: 强调了现有度量标准的糟糕表现，并描述了此类度量标准在识别临床显著变化方面的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种检测临床相关信息移除的新方法。

Abstract: De-identification in the healthcare setting is an application of NLP where
automated algorithms are used to remove personally identifying information of
patients (and, sometimes, providers). With the recent rise of generative large
language models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of
papers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often
report near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility
and utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key
limitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering
direct comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in
capturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically
relevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which
aim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a
survey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity
in reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to
quantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we
conduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the
removal of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their
efficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations
of such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes. Lastly, we
propose a novel methodology for the detection of clinically relevant
information removal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Agent评估忽略了文化和语言的多样性，通常依赖于单一语言或简单翻译的基准。因此，论文旨在解决在现实、多语言条件下，大型语言模型准确生成函数调用的能力评估问题。

Method: 论文构建了一个模拟足球票务购买场景的Ticket-Bench基准测试，涵盖葡萄牙语、英语、西班牙语、德语、意大利语和法语六种语言，并使用本地化的球队、城市和用户资料以提高真实度。

Result: 论文评估了各种商业和开源的LLM，结果表明，注重推理的模型（如GPT-5, Qwen3-235B）表现最佳，但仍存在显著的跨语言差异。

Conclusion: 论文强调需要具有文化意识的多语言基准来指导强大的LLM Agent的开发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented
agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function
calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent
evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying
on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a
benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios.
Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major
languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using
localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of
realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring
function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that
reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but
still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the
need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of
robust LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多量化大型语言模型（LLM）不确定性的黑盒技术依赖于重复的LLM采样，这在计算上可能非常昂贵。因此，实际应用需要从少量样本中进行可靠的估计。语义熵（SE）是一种流行的基于样本的不确定性估计器，其离散公式对于黑盒设置很有吸引力。

Method: 本文提出了一种改进的语义字母表大小估计器，并使用它来调整离散语义熵以适应样本覆盖率，从而在感兴趣的设置中获得更准确的语义熵估计。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的字母表大小估计器可以像最近表现最好的方法一样好地标记不正确的LLM响应，并且具有高度可解释性的额外好处。

Conclusion: 本文通过修改语义字母表大小估计器，改进了离散语义熵估计，使其在少量样本下也能更准确地估计LLM的不确定性，同时保持了高度的可解释性。

Abstract: Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language
models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally
expensive. Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from
few samples. Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty
estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting.
Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination
detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional
hyperparameters. For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic
entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy,
as expected from theory. We propose a modified semantic alphabet size
estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for
sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our
setting of interest. Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags
incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing
approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.

core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses
the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance
exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical
reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the
text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially,
we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal
foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on
interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving
the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.

### [31] [Translate, then Detect: Leveraging Machine Translation for Cross-Lingual Toxicity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14493)
*Samuel J. Bell,Eduardo Sánchez,David Dale,Pontus Stenetorp,Mikel Artetxe,Marta R. Costa-jussà*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用翻译方法进行大规模多语言毒性检测的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于许多语言缺乏训练数据和资源，多语言毒性检测仍然是一个重大挑战。以前的工作已经利用翻译测试范例来支持跨多种分类任务的跨语言迁移，但翻译在支持大规模毒性检测中的效用仍不清楚。

Method: 本文对基于翻译的和特定于语言/多语言的分类管道进行了全面比较。

Result: 研究发现，在 81.3% 的情况下（16 种语言中的 13 种），基于翻译的管道始终优于分布外分类器，并且翻译优势与目标语言的资源水平和机器翻译 (MT) 系统的质量密切相关。传统的分类器优于大型语言模型 (LLM) 判断器，对于低资源语言，这种优势尤其明显，在 6/7 的情况下，翻译分类方法优于翻译判断方法。

Conclusion: MT 专用 LLM 微调产生的拒绝率低于标准指令调整模型，但它会对低资源语言的毒性检测精度产生负面影响。这些发现为开发可扩展的多语言内容审核系统的从业者提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Multilingual toxicity detection remains a significant challenge due to the
scarcity of training data and resources for many languages. While prior work
has leveraged the translate-test paradigm to support cross-lingual transfer
across a range of classification tasks, the utility of translation in
supporting toxicity detection at scale remains unclear. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive comparison of translation-based and
language-specific/multilingual classification pipelines. We find that
translation-based pipelines consistently outperform out-of-distribution
classifiers in 81.3% of cases (13 of 16 languages), with translation benefits
strongly correlated with both the resource level of the target language and the
quality of the machine translation (MT) system. Our analysis reveals that
traditional classifiers outperform large language model (LLM) judges, with this
advantage being particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where
translate-classify methods dominate translate-judge approaches in 6 out of 7
cases. We additionally show that MT-specific fine-tuning on LLMs yields lower
refusal rates compared to standard instruction-tuned models, but it can
negatively impact toxicity detection accuracy for low-resource languages. These
findings offer actionable guidance for practitioners developing scalable
multilingual content moderation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OmniGEC，一个多语种语法纠错（GEC）的银标准数据集集合，涵盖11种语言。这些数据集促进了多语种GEC解决方案的开发，并有助于弥合在将英语GEC解决方案适配到多语种GEC中的数据差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了促进多语种语法纠错（GEC）解决方案的开发，并弥合将英语GEC解决方案应用于多语种GEC时的数据鸿沟。

Method: 通过收集来自Wikipedia edits, Reddit subreddits, 和 UberText 2.0的数据，并使用GPT-4o-mini模型自动修正Reddit和UberText 2.0数据，构建了包含11种语言的OmniGEC数据集。使用自动和手动方式评估数据集质量，并使用OmniGEC语料库对Aya-Expanse (8B) 和 Gemma-3 (12B)进行微调。

Result: 在段落级多语种GEC上取得了最先进（SOTA）的结果。

Conclusion: 本文发布了OmniGEC数据集，并在多语种GEC任务上验证了其有效性。数据集和最佳模型可在Hugging Face上获取。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniGEC, a collection of multilingual
silver-standard datasets for the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC),
covering eleven languages: Czech, English, Estonian, German, Greek, Icelandic,
Italian, Latvian, Slovene, Swedish, and Ukrainian. These datasets facilitate
the development of multilingual GEC solutions and help bridge the data gap in
adapting English GEC solutions to multilingual GEC. The texts in the datasets
originate from three sources: Wikipedia edits for the eleven target languages,
subreddits from Reddit in the eleven target languages, and the Ukrainian-only
UberText 2.0 social media corpus. While Wikipedia edits were derived from
human-made corrections, the Reddit and UberText 2.0 data were automatically
corrected with the GPT-4o-mini model. The quality of the corrections in the
datasets was evaluated both automatically and manually. Finally, we fine-tune
two open-source large language models - Aya-Expanse (8B) and Gemma-3 (12B) - on
the multilingual OmniGEC corpora and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results
for paragraph-level multilingual GEC. The dataset collection and the
best-performing models are available on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现自然的人机交互，需要能够同时听和说的真正全双工语音通信。

Method: 建立了一个分类法，区分了工程同步和学习同步，并将评估方法统一到一个框架中，该框架包括时间动态、行为仲裁、语义连贯性和声学性能。

Result: 通过对主流FD-SLM的比较分析，找出了同步数据稀缺、架构差异和评估差距等基本挑战。

Conclusion: 为推进人机通信，需要解决同步数据稀缺、架构差异和评估差距等问题，并为未来的研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: True Full-Duplex (TFD) voice communication--enabling simultaneous listening
and speaking with natural turn-taking, overlapping speech, and
interruptions--represents a critical milestone toward human-like AI
interaction. This survey comprehensively reviews Full-Duplex Spoken Language
Models (FD-SLMs) in the LLM era. We establish a taxonomy distinguishing
Engineered Synchronization (modular architectures) from Learned Synchronization
(end-to-end architectures), and unify fragmented evaluation approaches into a
framework encompassing Temporal Dynamics, Behavioral Arbitration, Semantic
Coherence, and Acoustic Performance. Through comparative analysis of mainstream
FD-SLMs, we identify fundamental challenges: synchronous data scarcity,
architectural divergence, and evaluation gaps, providing a roadmap for
advancing human-AI communication.

*Yihan Cao,Yanbin Kang,Zhengming Xing,Ruijie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Delta-KD，通过保留教师模型在有监督微调期间引入的分布偏移 Delta，来鼓励学生模型逼近最佳表示空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token level KD假设学生和教师输出分布共享相同的最优表示空间，但这在很多情况下可能不成立。

Method: 提出 Delta Knowledge Distillation (Delta-KD)，一种token level KD的扩展方法。

Result: 在ROUGE指标上，Delta-KD 显著提高了学生模型的性能，同时保留了更多的教师模型知识。

Conclusion: Delta-KD 是一种有效的知识蒸馏方法，可以提升学生模型的性能并保留教师模型的知识。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted approach for compressing
large neural networks by transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a
smaller student model. In the context of large language models, token level KD,
typically minimizing the KL divergence between student output distribution and
teacher output distribution, has shown strong empirical performance. However,
prior work assumes student output distribution and teacher output distribution
share the same optimal representation space, a premise that may not hold in
many cases. To solve this problem, we propose Delta Knowledge Distillation
(Delta-KD), a novel extension of token level KD that encourages the student to
approximate an optimal representation space by explicitly preserving the
distributional shift Delta introduced during the teacher's supervised
finetuning (SFT). Empirical results on ROUGE metrics demonstrate that Delta KD
substantially improves student performance while preserving more of the
teacher's knowledge.

*Zhengxiang Wang,Nafis Irtiza Tripto,Solha Park,Zhenzhen Li,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)越来越多地集成到个人写作工具中，一个关键问题是：llm能否仅从几个例子中忠实地模仿个人的写作风格？


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估state-of-the-art的llm通过上下学习模仿个人写作风格的能力。

Method: 通过引入包括作者归属、作者验证、风格匹配和AI检测等互补指标的集合来评估风格模仿。

Result: 虽然llm可以在新闻和电子邮件等结构化格式中近似用户风格，但它们在博客和论坛中难以处理细微的非正式写作。

Conclusion: 个性化的LLM自适应存在根本差距，需要改进技术以支持隐式的、风格一致的生成。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal
writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an
individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often
subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet
essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles
via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We
introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship
attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to
robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations
per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering
writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while
LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email,
they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further
analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations
reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a
fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved
techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future
research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种控制教育对话系统中语言熟练程度的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在支持第二语言习得方面表现出色，但调整LLM生成回复的语言难度以匹配学习者的熟练程度仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 该方法利用三种语言特征（可读性特征、句法特征和词汇特征）来量化和调节文本复杂度，并在语言注释对话数据上训练LLM。

Result: 结果表明，该方法在语言熟练程度的可控性方面优于基于prompt的方法，同时保持了较高的对话质量。Dilaprix指标与专家对语言难度的判断有很强的相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架能够精确地调节语言熟练程度，具有灵活性和稳定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting
second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues
for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of
LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a
challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for
controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach
leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g.,
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth),
and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text
complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated
dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming
prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we
introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features,
which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty.
Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of
language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型如何支持主题分析，这是一种用于发现患者和提供者叙述模式的常用但资源密集型的方法。

Method: 系统回顾了近期研究，并采访了一位临床医生。

Result: 当前方法在主题分析类型、数据集、提示策略和模型使用方面仍然分散，尤其是在评估方面。现有的评估方法差异很大，阻碍了进展，并妨碍了跨研究的有意义的基准测试。

Conclusion: 建立标准化的评估实践对于推进该领域至关重要。为此，我们提出了一个以有效性、可靠性和可解释性为中心的评估框架。

Abstract: This position paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can support
thematic analysis of unstructured clinical transcripts, a widely used but
resource-intensive method for uncovering patterns in patient and provider
narratives. We conducted a systematic review of recent studies applying LLMs to
thematic analysis, complemented by an interview with a practicing clinician.
Our findings reveal that current approaches remain fragmented across multiple
dimensions including types of thematic analysis, datasets, prompting strategies
and models used, most notably in evaluation. Existing evaluation methods vary
widely (from qualitative expert review to automatic similarity metrics),
hindering progress and preventing meaningful benchmarking across studies. We
argue that establishing standardized evaluation practices is critical for
advancing the field. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework centered
on three dimensions: validity, reliability, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电子商务中，理解印尼语的情感对于改善客户体验至关重要。

Method: 研究方法包括数据增强（如回译和同义词替换）和超参数调整。

Result: IndoBERT 模型达到了 80% 的准确率，数据增强是提高准确率的关键因素。结合多个 IndoBERT 模型略有改进，但提升不明显。

Conclusion: IndoBERT 是印尼语情感分类最有效的模型，数据增强至关重要。未来研究应探索替代架构和策略以提高印尼语 NLP 任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding emotions in the Indonesian language is essential for improving
customer experiences in e-commerce. This study focuses on enhancing the
accuracy of emotion classification in Indonesian by leveraging advanced
language models, IndoBERT and DistilBERT. A key component of our approach was
data processing, specifically data augmentation, which included techniques such
as back-translation and synonym replacement. These methods played a significant
role in boosting the model's performance. After hyperparameter tuning, IndoBERT
achieved an accuracy of 80\%, demonstrating the impact of careful data
processing. While combining multiple IndoBERT models led to a slight
improvement, it did not significantly enhance performance. Our findings
indicate that IndoBERT was the most effective model for emotion classification
in Indonesian, with data augmentation proving to be a vital factor in achieving
high accuracy. Future research should focus on exploring alternative
architectures and strategies to improve generalization for Indonesian NLP
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM非学习方法，该方法使用自生成数据进行非学习，解决了忘记数据难以获取或与模型内部表示不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM非学习方法通常假设可以完全访问忘记数据集，但忘记数据通常是隐私敏感的、稀有的或受到法律监管的，这使得获取成本高昂或不切实际，并且可用忘记数据的分布可能与该信息在模型中的表示方式不一致。

Method: 我们提出了一种“Reveal-and-Release”方法，通过优化指令提示模型来揭示它所知道的内容，从而使用自生成数据进行非学习。为了充分利用自生成的忘记数据，我们提出了一个迭代非学习框架，在该框架中，我们使用在忘记数据上训练的参数高效模块对模型的权重空间进行增量调整。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法平衡了遗忘质量和效用保持之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种新的LLM非学习方法，该方法使用自生成数据进行非学习，解决了忘记数据难以获取或与模型内部表示不一致的问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in
removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data).
Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset,
overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive,
rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2)
The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that
information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we
propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data,
where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions.
To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative
unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's
weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between
forget quality and utility preservation.

TL;DR: 提出了SWE-QA，一个用于评估在真实代码环境中自动问答系统的代码仓库级别问答基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准主要集中在小的、独立的代代码片段，无法捕捉真实代码仓库的复杂性，而理解和推理通常需要在多个文件中导航，理解软件架构，并将答案建立在长期的代码依赖关系中。

Method: 从11个流行的代码仓库中爬取了77,100个GitHub issues，基于对从这些issues中提取的自然发生的开发者问题的分析，开发了一个两层的仓库级别问题分类，并为每个类别构建了一组种子问题。对于每个类别，手动策划和验证问题，并收集相应的答案。此外，还开发了一个名为SWE-QA-Agent的agent框架，其中LLM agents进行推理和行动以自动查找答案。

Result: 在SWE-QA上评估了六个先进的LLM，实验结果突出了LLM在解决仓库级别QA方面的潜力，特别是SWE-QA-Agent框架。

Conclusion: 揭示了开放的挑战，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an
essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing
benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly
focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the
complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and
reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software
architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this
paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA)
benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic
code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs
spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file
reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first
crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis
of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we
developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a
set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated
and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a
prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in
which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six
advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies.
Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our
SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing
open challenges and pointing to future research directions.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为MUSE的框架，用于解决大型语言模型在多轮对话中出现的越狱攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型与人类价值观对齐至关重要，以防止对抗者利用模型生成有害内容。现有的防御方法主要针对单轮攻击，而实际应用中多轮对话会暴露模型的漏洞。

Method: 论文提出了MUSE-A，一种利用框架语义和启发式树搜索来探索多样语义轨迹的攻击方法。同时，提出了MUSE-D，一种细粒度的安全对齐方法，通过在对话早期进行干预来减少漏洞。

Result: 在各种模型上的大量实验表明，MUSE能够有效地识别和缓解多轮漏洞。

Conclusion: MUSE框架有效地识别和缓解了多轮对话中的安全漏洞。

Abstract: As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their
alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries
manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target
single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues,
exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety
measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn
jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A,
a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse
semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety
alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce
vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE
effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities. Code is

*Ying Fang,Xiaofei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于单峰聚合 (UMA) 的非自回归模型，用于英语和普通话语音识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的 UMA 显式地分割和聚合同一文本标记的声学帧（具有单峰权重，首先单调增加然后减少），以学习比常规连接主义时间分类 (CTC) 更好的表示。然而，它只在普通话中效果良好。它在其他语言（如英语）中表现不佳，因为英语的一个音节可能会被标记化为多个细粒度的标记，或者一个标记跨越的声学帧少于 3 个，并且无法形成单峰权重。

Method: 为了解决这个问题，我们建议允许每个 UMA 聚合的帧映射到多个标记，通过一个简单的拆分模块，该模块从每个聚合的帧生成两个标记，然后再计算 CTC 损失。

Result: 未提供具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提供结论。

Abstract: This paper proposes a unimodal aggregation (UMA) based nonautoregressive
model for both English and Mandarin speech recognition. The original UMA
explicitly segments and aggregates acoustic frames (with unimodal weights that
first monotonically increase and then decrease) of the same text token to learn
better representations than regular connectionist temporal classification
(CTC). However, it only works well in Mandarin. It struggles with other
languages, such as English, for which a single syllable may be tokenized into
multiple fine-grained tokens, or a token spans fewer than 3 acoustic frames and
fails to form unimodal weights. To address this problem, we propose allowing
each UMA-aggregated frame map to multiple tokens, via a simple split module
that generates two tokens from each aggregated frame before computing the CTC
loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableDART: A training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs.

Method: A lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. A novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning.

Result: TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%.

Conclusion: TableDART is a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core
challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches
flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural
cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with
fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to
combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both
modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs),
inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly
fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a
training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing
pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight
2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path
(either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair,
effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In
addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration
by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the
best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids
the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance
among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向阿拉伯语的自监督语音模型HArnESS，它体积小、效果好，适合在资源有限的环境中使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语音模型在下游任务中表现出色，但对于资源有限的环境来说，部署不切实际。本文旨在设计能够捕捉阿拉伯语语音细微差别的模型。

Method: 使用迭代自蒸馏训练大型双语HArnESS (HL) SSL模型，然后将知识提炼成压缩的学生模型 (HS, HST)，保留阿拉伯语特定表示。使用低秩近似进一步将教师的离散监督压缩为浅薄模型。

Result: 在阿拉伯语ASR、说话人情感识别 (SER) 和方言识别 (DID) 任务上的评估表明，HArnESS 有效对抗 HuBERT 和 XLS-R。通过最少的微调，HArnESS 实现了 SOTA 或可比的性能。

Conclusion: HArnESS 是一种轻量级但功能强大的替代方案，适用于实际使用。发布了精馏模型和研究结果，以支持在低资源环境中进行负责任的研究和部署。

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models excel in downstream tasks but their
deployment is impractical for resource-limited environments. In this paper, we
introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model
family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative
self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then
distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving
Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further
compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We
evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect
Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R.
With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance,
making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release
our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and
deployment in low-resource settings.

Result: 一个策略性设计的单一prompting方法可以达到与更多资源密集型方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种适用于具有内在约束的现实环境的可行方法。

Abstract: Although offensive language continually evolves over time, even recent
studies using LLMs have predominantly relied on outdated datasets and rarely
evaluated the generalization ability on unseen texts. In this study, we
constructed a large-scale dataset of contemporary political discourse and
employed three refined judgments in the absence of ground truth. Each judgment
reflects a representative offensive language detection method and is carefully
designed for optimal conditions. We identified distinct patterns for each
judgment and demonstrated tendencies of label agreement using a leave-one-out
strategy. By establishing pseudo-labels as ground trust for quantitative
performance assessment, we observed that a strategically designed single
prompting achieves comparable performance to more resource-intensive methods.
This suggests a feasible approach applicable in real-world settings with
inherent constraints.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的训练方法，称为解耦代理对齐（DPA），以解决多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）中语言先验冲突的问题，从而优化视觉-语言对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型主要通过高质量数据集、新颖的架构和优化后的训练策略来提高性能，但忽略了语言先验冲突的问题，即大型语言模型固有的语言先验与训练数据集中的语言先验不匹配，导致次优的视觉-语言对齐。

Method: 该论文提出了一种名为解耦代理对齐（DPA）的训练方法，该方法引入了两个关键创新：(1) 在预训练期间使用代理LLM，将视觉-语言对齐过程与语言先验干扰分离；(2) 基于视觉相关性的动态损失调整，以加强视觉相关token的优化信号。

Result: DPA显著缓解了语言先验冲突，并在不同的数据集、模型系列和规模上实现了卓越的对齐性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了MLLM训练的有效性，而且表现出卓越的泛化能力，使其成为一种强大的视觉-语言对齐方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities.
Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance
through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training
strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue,
language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of
large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This
conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to
adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we
propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA
introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining
to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior
interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to
strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior
conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets,
model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of
MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it
a robust approach for vision-language alignment. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集通常孤立地处理理解和生成任务，限制了统一视觉大语言模型（VLLM）的性能。

Method: 构建了一个名为UnifiedVisual的新数据集构建框架，无缝集成了多样化的视觉和文本输入输出，实现全面的跨模态推理和精确的文本到图像对齐。

Result: 在UnifiedVisual-240K上训练的模型在各种任务中都表现出色，并且在多模态理解和生成之间表现出显著的相互增强。

Conclusion: UnifiedVisual代表了推动统一VLLM发展和释放其全部潜力的新增长点。

Abstract: Unified vision large language models (VLLMs) have recently achieved
impressive advancements in both multimodal understanding and generation,
powering applications such as visual question answering and text-guided image
synthesis. However, progress in unified VLLMs remains constrained by the lack
of datasets that fully exploit the synergistic potential between these two core
abilities. Existing datasets typically address understanding and generation in
isolation, thereby limiting the performance of unified VLLMs. To bridge this
critical gap, we introduce a novel dataset construction framework,
UnifiedVisual, and present UnifiedVisual-240K, a high-quality dataset
meticulously designed to facilitate mutual enhancement between multimodal
understanding and generation. UnifiedVisual-240K seamlessly integrates diverse
visual and textual inputs and outputs, enabling comprehensive cross-modal
reasoning and precise text-to-image alignment. Our dataset encompasses a wide
spectrum of tasks and data sources, ensuring rich diversity and addressing key
shortcomings of prior resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained on UnifiedVisual-240K consistently achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks. Notably, these models exhibit significant mutual
reinforcement between multimodal understanding and generation, further
validating the effectiveness of our framework and dataset. We believe
UnifiedVisual represents a new growth point for advancing unified VLLMs and
unlocking their full potential. Our code and datasets is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAIO: A new Korean math benchmark for evaluating long-chain reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Korean benchmarks are saturated, making it difficult to evaluate and rank frontier models.

Method: Introduce KAIO, a private Korean, math-centric benchmark that stresses long-chain reasoning. It will be served via a held-out evaluator until the best publicly known model reaches at least 80% accuracy, after which the set will be released and iterated to a harder version.

Result: KAIO is far from saturated. GPT-5 attains 62.8, Gemini-2.5-Pro attains 52.3, and open models such as Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 cluster falls below 30.

Conclusion: KAIO enables robust tracking of frontier progress in Korean.

Abstract: With the advancement of mid/post-training techniques, LLMs are pushing their
boundaries at an accelerated pace. Legacy benchmarks saturate quickly (e.g.,
broad suites like MMLU over the years, newer ones like GPQA-D even faster),
which makes frontier progress hard to track. The problem is especially acute in
Korean: widely used benchmarks are fewer, often translated or narrow in scope,
and updated more slowly, so saturation and contamination arrive sooner.
Accordingly, at this moment, there is no Korean benchmark capable of evaluating
and ranking frontier models. To bridge this gap, we introduce KAIO, a Korean,
math-centric benchmark that stresses long-chain reasoning. Unlike recent Korean
suites that are at or near saturation, KAIO remains far from saturated: the
best-performing model, GPT-5, attains 62.8, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro (52.3).
Open models such as Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 cluster falls below 30,
demonstrating substantial headroom, enabling robust tracking of frontier
progress in Korean. To reduce contamination, KAIO will remain private and be
served via a held-out evaluator until the best publicly known model reaches at
least 80% accuracy, after which we will release the set and iterate to a harder
version.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地应用于各种现实场景，每个场景都受用户或组织定制的特定行为和安全规范（spec）的约束。本文将此挑战形式化为规范对齐，侧重于LLM遵循来自行为和安全角度的动态的、特定于场景的规范的能力。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种轻量级方法Align3，该方法采用具有分层反思和修正的测试时审议（TTD）来推理规范边界。我们进一步提出了SpecBench，这是一个用于测量规范对齐的统一基准，涵盖5个场景、103个规范和1,500个提示。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地应用于各种现实场景，每个场景都受用户或组织定制的特定行为和安全规范（spec）的约束。这些规范分为安全规范和行为规范，因场景而异，并随着偏好和要求的变化而演变。

Method: 我们提出了一种轻量级方法Align3，该方法采用具有分层反思和修正的测试时审议（TTD）来推理规范边界。我们进一步提出了SpecBench，这是一个用于测量规范对齐的统一基准，涵盖5个场景、103个规范和1,500个提示。

Result: 在15个推理模型和18个指令模型上使用几种TTD方法（包括Self-Refine、TPO和MoreThink）进行的实验产生了三个关键发现：（i）测试时审议增强了规范对齐；（ii）Align3以最小的开销推进了安全-帮助性权衡前沿；（iii）SpecBench有效地揭示了对齐差距。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了测试时审议作为一种推理真实世界规范边界的有效策略的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in diverse real-world
scenarios, each governed by bespoke behavioral and safety specifications (spec)
custom-tailored by users or organizations. These spec, categorized into
safety-spec and behavioral-spec, vary across scenarios and evolve with changing
preferences and requirements. We formalize this challenge as specification
alignment, focusing on LLMs' ability to follow dynamic, scenario-specific spec
from both behavioral and safety perspectives. To address this challenge, we
propose Align3, a lightweight method that employs Test-Time Deliberation (TTD)
with hierarchical reflection and revision to reason over the specification
boundaries. We further present SpecBench, a unified benchmark for measuring
specification alignment, covering 5 scenarios, 103 spec, and 1,500 prompts.
Experiments on 15 reasoning and 18 instruct models with several TTD methods,
including Self-Refine, TPO, and MoreThink, yield three key findings: (i)
test-time deliberation enhances specification alignment; (ii) Align3 advances
the safety-helpfulness trade-off frontier with minimal overhead; (iii)
SpecBench effectively reveals alignment gaps. These results highlight the
potential of test-time deliberation as an effective strategy for reasoning over
the real-world specification boundaries.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)变得越来越精通多种语言，但同时也表现出更多的语言混淆，即它们倾向于以不同于提示语言或用户明确要求的答案语言生成答案。本文提出ReCoVeR，这是一种基于语言特定steering vectors的轻量级方法，用于减少语言混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)变得越来越精通多种语言，但同时也表现出更多的语言混淆，即它们倾向于以不同于提示语言或用户明确要求的答案语言生成答案。

Method: 首先，在多并行语料库的帮助下分离语言向量，然后通过固定(即无监督)以及可训练的steering 函数有效地利用这些向量进行有效的LLM steering。

Result: 我们广泛的评估，包括三个基准和18种语言，表明ReCoVeR有效地减轻了单语和跨语设置中的语言混淆，同时——与先前的语言steering 方法相比——保留了任务性能。

Conclusion: ReCoVeR有效地减轻了单语和跨语设置中的语言混淆，同时保留了任务性能。

Abstract: As they become increasingly multilingual, Large Language Models (LLMs)
exhibit more language confusion, i.e., they tend to generate answers in a
language different from the language of the prompt or the answer language
explicitly requested by the user. In this work, we propose ReCoVeR (REducing
language COnfusion in VEctor Representations), a novel lightweight approach for
reducing language confusion based on language-specific steering vectors. We
first isolate language vectors with the help of multi-parallel corpus and then
effectively leverage those vectors for effective LLM steering via fixed (i.e.,
unsupervised) as well as trainable steering functions. Our extensive
evaluation, encompassing three benchmarks and 18 languages, shows that ReCoVeR
effectively mitigates language confusion in both monolingual and cross-lingual
setups while at the same time -- and in contrast to prior language steering
methods -- retaining task performance. Our data code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES) 的多智能体评估框架，旨在零样本设置下执行精确且与人类对齐的评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的出现为自动作文评分（AES）带来了一种新的范例，但实现人类水平的多角度理解和判断仍然是一个挑战。

Method: RES基于LLM构建评估器代理，每个代理都针对特定的提示和主题上下文量身定制。每个代理独立生成基于特征的规则，并进行多角度评估。然后，通过模拟圆桌式讨论，RES通过辩证推理过程整合个人评估，从而产生与人类评估更紧密地对齐的最终整体评分。

Result: 在ASAP数据集上使用ChatGPT和Claude进行的实验表明，RES在平均QWK方面比直接提示（Vanilla）方法提高了高达34.86%。

Conclusion: 通过实现具有不同评估视角的代理之间的协作和共识，RES优于先前的零样本AES方法。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought a new paradigm to
automated essay scoring (AES), a long-standing and practical application of
natural language processing in education. However, achieving human-level
multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work,
we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework
designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot
setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a
specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a
trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by
simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual
evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic
score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration
and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES
outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset
using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in
average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉干预通常依赖于粗糙的像素级扰动，限制了对多模态融合的语义洞察。

Method: 结合视觉语义编辑和注意力调节，实现概念级的视觉操作，并识别在对象、属性和关系三个语义层面上对预测有积极或消极贡献的注意力头。

Result: 发现积极的头通常在同一语义级别内共享，但在不同级别之间变化，而消极的头往往具有广泛的泛化性。通过调节关键头嵌入，提高了LLaVA和InstructBLIP在三个不同的VQA基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: V-SEAM框架能够有效地对VLMs进行因果解释，并通过操纵关键注意力头来提高模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in causal interpretability have extended from language models
to vision-language models (VLMs), seeking to reveal their internal mechanisms
through input interventions. While textual interventions often target
semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level
perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this
study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic
Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM
enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with
positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels:
objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are
often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while
negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic
method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for
both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks. Our data and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack structured reasoning for genuine psychological support, especially in Chinese.

Method: A novel framework called Empathy-R1 that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Result: Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics and human evaluations, with a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on a new benchmark.

Conclusion: Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support by enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses.

Abstract: Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when
addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language
Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the
structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly
in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel
framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by
cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially
reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its
thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered
by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training
process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure.
Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic
relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments
show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More
importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear
preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our
new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses,
Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and
genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少问题数量的同时，与全面评估结果相比，相关性显著提高，PLCC提升高达17.6%，SRCC提升高达16.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的基准测试提供了一种可靠且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred
the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage
Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency.
Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview
paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a
two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases,
(ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an
adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on
different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly
higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with
improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the
number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed
paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM
benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降，领域泛化旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了类不变测试时增强（CI-TTA）技术，通过生成输入图像的多个变体（弹性形变和网格形变），并使用置信度引导的过滤方案聚合预测结果。

Result: 在PACS和Office-Home数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在不同的DG算法和骨干网络上都能获得一致的收益。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有普遍性。

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

TL;DR: AToken是一个统一的视觉分词器，它在图像、视频和 3D 资产上实现了高保真重建和语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器专注于单一模态的重建或理解，AToken旨在统一视觉任务和模态。

Method: 使用具有 4D 旋转位置嵌入的纯 Transformer 架构，并结合感知和 Gram 矩阵损失的无对抗训练目标。

Result: AToken 在图像、视频和 3D 任务上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: AToken 为构建在统一视觉分词基础上的下一代多模态 AI 系统提供了可能。

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MemEvo的增量多视图聚类方法，旨在解决稳定性-可塑性困境（SPD），在不断增长的视图中实现稳定的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决增量多视图聚类中模型需要快速适应新数据，同时保持足够的稳定性以巩固长期知识和防止灾难性遗忘的问题（SPD）。

Method: 提出了一种受神经科学中海马-前额皮层协同记忆机制启发的Memory-Evolving增量多视图聚类方法(MemEvo)。该方法包括：1) 海马体启发的视图对齐模块，通过对齐连续表示中的结构来捕获新视图的增益信息；2) 认知遗忘机制，模拟人类记忆的衰减模式来调节历史知识的权重；3) 前额皮层启发的知识巩固记忆模块，利用时间张量稳定性来逐渐巩固历史知识。

Result: MemEvo在不断增长的视图场景中实现了强大的知识保留能力，并通过大量实验证明了其优于现有最先进方法的显著优势。

Conclusion: MemEvo方法在增量多视图聚类任务中表现出色，能够有效平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Shangrong Wu,Yanghong Zhou,Yang Chen,Feng Zhang,P. Y. Mok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新颖的思维链重排序（CoTRR）方法，利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）直接参与图像检索的重排序过程，以充分利用其多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅在评估中使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），而没有直接将其用于排序过程，导致其丰富的多模态推理能力未被充分利用，性能欠佳。

Method: 该方法设计了一个列表式排序提示，使 MLLM 能够直接参与候选图像的重排序。此排序过程基于图像评估提示，该提示评估每个候选图像与用户查询的匹配程度。此外，引入查询分解提示，将原始查询分解为多个语义组件，以实现结构化和细粒度的分析。

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，CoTRR 方法的有效性，该方法在三个图像检索任务（包括文本到图像检索 (TIR)、组合图像检索 (CIR) 和基于聊天的图像检索 (Chat-IR)）中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的 CoTRR 方法有效地利用了 MLLM 的多模态推理能力，并在图像检索任务中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

### [62] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的边缘引导的注意力机制，用于单图像超分辨率（SISR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的边缘感知方法通常将边缘先验或注意力分支附加到日益复杂的骨干网络上，但Ad hoc融合经常引入冗余、不稳定的优化或有限的结构增益。

Method: 该方法从联合编码的边缘特征和中间特征激活中导出一个自适应调制图，然后应用它来归一化和重新加权响应，选择性地放大结构上显著的区域，同时抑制虚假的纹理。此外，该机制被集成到一个轻量级的残差设计中，该设计在结合像素、感知和对抗性项的复合目标下训练，以平衡保真度、感知真实感和训练稳定性。

Result: 在标准SISR基准上进行的大量实验表明，在可比的模型复杂度下，结构清晰度和感知质量方面，相对于SRGAN、ESRGAN和先前的边缘注意基线，该方法具有一致的改进。

Conclusion: 提出的公式提供了一种参数有效的注入边缘先验的路径，通过定制的多项损失稳定了对抗性细化，并在不求助于更深或过度参数化的架构的情况下增强了边缘保真度。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的自适应迭代点云去噪方法，通过估计噪声变化并确定自适应去噪计划来迭代更新点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云去噪方法通常训练深度神经网络来更新点的位置，并通过重复去噪过程来获得去噪结果，但如何有效地安排迭代去噪过程以处理不同程度或模式的噪声尚不清楚。

Method: 首先估计噪声变化并确定具有适当步长的自适应去噪计划，然后迭代调用训练后的网络以按照自适应计划更新点云。设计了网络架构和两阶段采样策略，以实现特征融合和梯度融合，从而进行迭代去噪。

Result: 该方法获得了干净平滑的去噪点云，同时更好地保留了形状边界和细节。在合成数据集和真实扫描数据集上，该方法在质量和数量上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有的点云去噪方法，并在合成数据集和真实扫描数据集上表现良好。

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [64] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉定位框架DiffVL，它将视觉定位重新定义为使用扩散模型的GPS去噪任务，利用噪声GPS轨迹、视觉BEV特征和SD地图联合建模来反转GPS噪声扰动，从而实现亚米级精度，无需依赖HD地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两难：高清地图提供高精度定位参考，但构建和维护成本高昂，阻碍了可扩展性，因此研究转向OpenStreetMap等标清地图。现有的基于标清地图的方法主要集中在图像和地图之间的鸟瞰图（BEV）匹配，忽略了普遍存在的信号噪声GPS。

Method: 提出DiffVL框架，利用扩散模型将视觉定位重新定义为GPS去噪任务。该方法通过联合建模GPS、SD地图和视觉信号，学习反转GPS噪声扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法与BEV匹配基线相比，实现了最先进的精度。证明了扩散模型可以通过将噪声GPS视为生成先验来实现可扩展的定位。

Conclusion: 扩散模型可以通过将噪声GPS视为生成先验来实现可扩展的定位，从而实现了从传统基于匹配的方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [65] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为扩散共识平衡（DICE）的框架，用于解决稀疏视图CT重建问题，该框架将双代理共识平衡集成到扩散模型的采样过程中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于欠采样，稀疏视图CT重建具有根本性的挑战，导致不适定的逆问题。传统的迭代方法结合了手工制作或学习的先验知识来规范解决方案，但难以捕捉医学图像中存在的复杂结构。

Method: DICE在以下两者之间交替：（i）数据一致性代理，通过执行测量一致性的近端算子实现；（ii）先验代理，通过DM在每个采样步骤执行干净的图像估计来实现。通过迭代平衡这两个互补的代理，DICE有效地将强大的生成先验能力与测量一致性相结合。

Result: 实验结果表明，在15、30和60个视图（总共180个）的均匀和非均匀稀疏视图设置下，DICE在重建高质量CT图像方面明显优于最先进的基线，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DICE框架有效地结合了强大的生成先验能力与测量一致性，可以在稀疏视图CT重建中实现高质量的图像重建。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督领域自适应方法，利用患者级别的诊断结果作为目标域中的弱监督，以解决溃疡性结肠炎（UC）严重程度估计中的领域转移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有溃疡性结肠炎（UC）严重程度估计方法容易受到不同医院成像设备和临床环境差异引起的领域转移的影响，且缺乏目标域的监督或标注成本高昂。

Method: 利用共享聚合令牌和最大严重程度三元组损失，对齐跨域的类间分布。

Result: 该方法在领域转移环境中优于其他领域自适应方法，提高了UC严重程度的估计。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的弱监督领域自适应方法，可以提高UC严重程度估计在领域转移环境中的准确性。

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究引入了一个小型基准，用于测试视觉-语言模型在城市感知方面的能力，使用了蒙特利尔的100张街道图像，这些图像在照片和照片级逼真的合成场景之间平均分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人们如何阅读城市景观可以为设计和规划提供信息。

Method: 使用来自七个社区团体的十二名参与者提供的230份注释表格，这些表格跨越30个维度，混合了物理属性和主观印象。在零样本设置中，使用结构化提示和确定性解析器评估了七个视觉-语言模型。单选题使用准确率，多标签项目使用杰卡德重叠；人类协议使用克里彭多夫α和成对杰卡德。

Result: 结果表明，模型在可见的客观属性上比在主观评估上具有更强的对齐性。最佳系统（claude-sonnet）在多标签项目上达到了宏平均0.31和平均杰卡德0.48。较高的人类协议与更好的模型得分相吻合。合成图像略微降低了得分。

Conclusion: 我们发布了基准、提示和工具，用于在参与式城市分析中进行可重复的、具有不确定性意识的评估。

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于动态点云压缩的Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) 框架，该框架使用时空对齐策略隐式建模连续时间变化，并设计了一种随机访问 (RA) 参考策略，支持帧级并行压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于显式运动估计，其编码向量难以捕捉复杂的动态，无法充分利用时间相关性。

Method: 用时空对齐策略代替显式运动向量，在潜在空间条件编码框架内使用对齐的特征作为时间上下文。设计随机访问 (RA) 参考策略，实现双向运动参考和分层编码。

Result: 在编码和解码效率方面优于 D-DPCC 和 AdaDPCC，并且 BD-Rate 分别降低了 20% 和 9.4%。

Conclusion: FMT 能够有效地提高压缩效率和处理性能。

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 HybridMamba 的新架构，用于 3D 生物医学图像分割，该架构结合了局部和全局上下文建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba 在 3D 生物医学图像分割中表现出卓越的性能，因为它解决了 CNN 在建模远程依赖关系方面的局限性，并减轻了基于 Transformer 的框架在处理高分辨率医学体积时的大量计算开销。然而，过度重视全局上下文建模可能会无意中损害关键的局部结构信息，从而导致分割输出中的边界模糊和区域失真。

Method: 该架构采用双重互补机制：1) 一种特征扫描策略，逐步整合轴向遍历和局部自适应路径的表示，以协调局部和全局表示之间的关系，以及 2) 一种门控模块，结合空间频率分析进行全面的上下文建模。

Result: 在 MRI 和 CT 数据集上的实验表明，HybridMamba 在 3D 医学图像分割方面显着优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: HybridMamba 是一种用于 3D 医学图像分割的有效架构，它通过结合局部和全局上下文建模来提高分割性能。

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个动态跳跃连接（DSC）块，以增强医学图像分割中U型网络的跨层连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跳跃连接存在 inter-feature constraint 和 intra-feature constraint 两个关键限制，影响了特征融合和全局上下文信息的有效聚合。

Method: 设计了包含 Test-Time Training (TTT) 模块和 Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) 模块的 DSC 块。TTT 模块用于动态调整推理过程中的隐藏表示，DMSK 模块自适应地选择核大小以增强多尺度特征集成。

Result: DSC 块具有架构无关性，可以无缝集成到现有的 U 型网络结构中，并在各种网络结构上展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的 DSC 块能够有效提升 U 型网络在医学图像分割任务中的性能。

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

Motivation: 骨骼动作识别面临两个长期挑战：标记训练样本的稀缺以及难以建模短程和远程时间依赖性。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新颖的具有并行短程和远程分支的LSTC模块，这些分支使用学习的相似性权重自适应地对齐和融合，以保留关键的远程线索。此外，该论文还扩展了JMDA，在输入层使用Additive Mixup，从而使训练样本多样化，并将混合操作限制在同一相机视图，以避免分布偏移。

Conclusion: 消融研究证实了每个组成部分的贡献。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%

Motivation: 现有的IBIE方法在编辑类型和样本数量上受限，且数据集通常包含噪声，限制了模型在复杂场景下的能力。

Method: 利用两个多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）生成视觉自适应编辑指令并产生高质量的编辑图像，构建了一个新的数据集构建流程。

Conclusion: MultiEdit为推进更多样化和更具挑战性的IBIE能力的研究提供了宝贵的资源。

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉基础模型解释生成方法，该方法通过引入注意力格子适配器（ALA）和交替周期架构（AEA）来提高模型的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏适应性，无法应用于复杂模型。

Method: 引入ALA和AEA两种新机制。ALA简化了手动层选择的过程，AEA每隔一个epoch更新ALA的参数，有效解决了注意力区域过小的问题。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和ImageNet-S数据集上，该方法在mean IoU、插入分数、删除分数和插入-删除分数方面均优于基线方法。在CUB-200-2011数据集上，最佳模型在mean IoU方面提高了53.2个点。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉基础模型的解释生成方面具有显著的优势。

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DACoN leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics in line drawings for automatic colorization, overcoming limitations of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for automatic colorization of line drawings struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes.

Method: DACoN fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs, allowing any number of reference images.

Result: DACoN achieves superior colorization performance by using multiple reference images.

Conclusion: DACoN effectively utilizes foundation models and multiple reference images to improve automatic colorization of line drawings.

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available
at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法FMGS-Avatar，用于从单目视频重建高保真可动画的人体化身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建高保真可动画人体化身具有挑战性，因为单视角观测中的几何信息不足。现有的3D高斯溅射方法难以保留表面细节。

Method: 1. 引入网格引导的2D高斯溅射，将2D高斯图元直接附加到模板网格面，约束其位置、旋转和运动，实现卓越的表面对齐和几何细节保留。2. 利用在大型数据集上训练的基础模型，例如Sapiens，以补充来自单目视频的有限视觉线索。通过选择性梯度隔离的协调训练策略解决不同模态表现出不同的参数敏感性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，该方法具有优越的重建质量，在几何精度和外观保真度方面有显著提高，同时提供丰富的语义信息。在共享规范空间内提取的先验知识自然地实现了新视角和姿势下空间和时间上一致的渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强的表示和协调的信息提取，显著提高了3D单目人体化身重建的水平。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Motivation: 历史艺术品中气味相关物体的识别具有挑战性，因为注释稀疏且类别极不平衡。

Method: 该方法探索了基于扩散的增强策略，并结合合成数据进行模型训练。

Result: 结果表明，将合成数据纳入模型训练可以提高检测性能。

Conclusion: 利用扩散模型的大规模预训练是提高检测准确性的一种有前途的方法，尤其是在注释稀缺且成本高昂的利基应用中。

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

Conclusion: 论文开源了基准测试代码，为社区提供了一个可复现且公正的视频VLM评估协议，并强调了未来研究中需要为每个基准数据集定制标准化帧采样策略。

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数化点云表示方法要么计算成本高，要么精度低。

Method: 首先使用高斯混合模型分割点云，然后将平面簇合并为平面或曲面，平面使用基于体素的边界描述方法进行拟合和限定，曲面使用B样条曲面进行拟合。

Result: 该曲面检测方法比现有技术更鲁棒，效率提高了3.78倍，精度比高斯混合模型提高了2倍，在低功耗机载计算机上以36.4 fps运行。

Conclusion: 提出了一种兼顾效率和精度的点云参数化表示方法。

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像超分辨率数据蒸馏方法，该方法不需要类别标签或预训练的SR模型，就能显著减少训练数据和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练需要大量数据和计算资源，而单图像超分辨率（SISR）领域尤其依赖大型训练数据集。现有的基于GAN反演的数据蒸馏方法依赖于预训练的SR网络和类别信息，限制了其通用性。

Method: 首先提取高梯度图像块，并基于CLIP特征对图像进行分类，然后微调扩散模型以学习图像块的分布并合成提炼的训练图像。

Result: 使用仅0.68%的原始数据集训练Transformer模型，性能下降仅0.3 dB。扩散模型微调需要4小时，SR模型训练在1小时内完成，远短于使用完整数据集的11小时训练时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著减少训练数据和计算时间的同时，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于简化的提示，忽略了完整放射学报告中丰富的语义细节，从而降低了文本图像对齐和临床保真度。

Method: 提出了一种放射学报告条件潜在扩散框架Report2CT，用于直接从自由文本放射学报告合成3D胸部CT体积，该框架结合了发现和印象部分，并使用多个文本编码器。Report2CT集成了三个预训练的医学文本编码器（BiomedVLP CXR BERT、MedEmbed和ClinicalBERT）来捕获细微的临床背景。

Result: Report2CT生成了在解剖学上一致的CT体积，具有出色的视觉质量和文本图像对齐效果。多编码器条件反射提高了CLIP评分，表明更好地保留了自由文本放射学报告中的细粒度临床细节。在MICCAI 2025的VLM3D挑战赛中，我们在文本条件CT生成方面排名第一，并在所有评估指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用完整的放射学报告和多编码器文本条件反射，Report2CT改进了3D CT合成，产生了临床上忠实且高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的骨骼分割算法，该算法可以更好地捕捉骨骼特征，并且能够鲁棒地处理骨骼骨折和软组织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 geodesic active contour 模型通常受限于其不加区分的特征提取，并且难以处理边缘阻塞、边缘泄漏和骨骼骨折的现象。

Method: 我们提出了一种为骨骼分割量身定制的骨折交互 geodesic active contour 算法。该算法结合了强度和梯度范数，构建了一种新的边缘检测器函数，该函数引导轮廓朝向骨骼边缘，而不会被其他软组织阻塞，从而减少了错误分割。此外，距离信息（可以嵌入骨折提示）被引入到轮廓演化中，作为自适应步长，以稳定演化并帮助轮廓停止在骨骼边缘和骨折处。

Result: 在骨盆和踝关节分割中的实验表明，该算法在解决上述问题方面是有效的，并且显示出准确、稳定和一致的性能，表明该算法在其他骨骼解剖结构中具有更广泛的应用。

Conclusion: 我们的算法也为结合领域知识和深度神经网络提供了见解。

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Result: 在先前被忽略的训练一致性和可重复性方面表现出显著的改进，而不会损害重建精度和拓扑正确性。

Conclusion: MED损失可以提高基于学习的CSR的训练一致性和可重复性，同时保持重建精度和拓扑正确性。

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX在骨骼健康分类中展示了最先进的性能，同时提供了可以被临床医生直观理解的解释。

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their

MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic
signs and road damage.

Result: 该框架在五个传统基准数据集上表现出优于以往基于正则化的方法的性能，包括合成和真实场景。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升模型在图像超分辨率任务中的泛化能力，尤其是在抑制噪声过拟合方面。

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MARIC的多智能体框架，用于图像分类，该框架通过协作推理过程重新构建图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像分类依赖于参数密集型模型训练，需要大规模注释数据集和广泛的微调才能实现有竞争力的性能。而最近的视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然缓解了其中一些限制，但它们仍然受到对单程表示的依赖性的限制，通常无法捕捉到视觉内容的互补方面。

Method: MARIC首先利用一个Outliner Agent来分析图像的全局主题并生成目标提示。基于这些提示，三个Aspect Agent提取沿不同视觉维度的细粒度描述。最后，一个Reasoning Agent通过集成的反射步骤综合这些互补的输出，从而生成用于分类的统一表示。

Result: 在4个不同的图像分类基准数据集上的实验表明，MARIC明显优于基线。

Conclusion: 多智能体视觉推理对于鲁棒和可解释的图像分类是有效的。

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强调了计算机视觉中人像图像使用日益广泛，保护个人身份的需求也日益增长，同时，匿名图像必须保持对下游计算机视觉任务的可用性。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型的修复能力，设计了一个自适应属性引导模块，该模块在反向去噪过程中应用梯度校正，使生成图像的面部属性与合成目标图像的面部属性对齐。

Result: 在公共 CelebA-HQ 和 FFHQ 数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，且无需额外的模型训练。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的匿名化框架，该框架在性能上优于现有技术，并且不需要额外的模型训练。

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

TL;DR: 本文利用乳腺癌患者新辅助化疗（NACT）期间的磁共振成像（MRI）数据，学习治疗反应早期动态的表征，以预测病理完全缓解（pCR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于疾病进展和治疗反应在患者之间差异很大，因此需要预测个体对治疗反应的模型。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 该方法使用多任务模型，该模型代表外观，促进时间连续性，并考虑非反应者队列中相对较高的异质性。纵向变化形成潜在空间中的轨迹，作为预测成功反应的基础。

Result: 在公开的ISPY-2数据集上的实验表明，潜在轨迹空间中的线性分类器仅使用预处理数据（T0）即可达到0.761的平衡精度，使用早期反应（T0 + T1）可达到0.811的平衡精度，使用四个成像时间点（T0 -> T3）可达到0.861的平衡精度。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，基于MRI数据的治疗反应早期动态表征可以有效预测乳腺癌患者对新辅助化疗的反应。

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 缺乏对数据驱动的航天器姿态估计方法决策过程的理解，阻碍了它们在实际任务中的采用。

Method: 使用通过姿态估计网络反向传播的梯度训练基于 NeRF 的图像生成器，以渲染姿态估计网络利用的主要 3D 特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够恢复相关的 3D 线索，并提供关于姿态估计网络监督及其目标航天器隐式表示之间关系的见解。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效可视化姿态估计器所依赖的 3D 视觉线索，并有助于理解姿态估计网络的决策过程。

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂视频对象分割在精确分割目标方面面临挑战，尤其是在存在小而相似的目标、频繁遮挡、快速运动和复杂交互的情况下。

Method: 该方法采用伪标签策略进行训练，并结合SAM2Long框架和SeC模型进行推理，通过级联决策机制动态整合两者的输出。

Result: 该方法在MOSE测试集上取得了0.8616的J&F得分，比SAM2Long基线提高了1.4个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在长而复杂的视频分割场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP模型在微调后，尤其是在人脸识别等复杂任务上，会过度专业化，损失跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CLIP模型在微调用于人脸识别(FR)、变脸攻击检测(MAD)和活体攻击检测(PAD)等生物特征任务时，可能过度专业化的问题，从而失去其泛化能力。

Method: 对三个分别针对FR、MAD和PAD微调的CLIP模型实例，以及原始CLIP基线模型，在14个通用视觉数据集上进行零样本和线性探针协议评估，同时也在常见的FR、MAD和PAD基准上进行评估。

Result: 微调后的模型存在过度专业化的问题，尤其是在针对复杂的人脸识别任务进行微调时。任务复杂性和分类头设计（多类 vs. 二元）与灾难性遗忘的程度相关。在IJB-C大规模人脸识别基准测试中，FRoundation模型表现最佳，但ImageNetV2上的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 较大的CLIP架构始终比小型变体更能保留模型的原始泛化能力，表明增加模型容量可能有助于缓解过度专业化问题。

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Motivation: 现有检测模型在图像真伪分类方面提供的信息有限，且MLLM方法在准确性方面落后于专家模型。

Method: 首先从MLLM中提取潜在知识，然后通过提示将其注入训练。

Result: DF-LLaVA在合成图像检测中实现了高准确性和可解释性，优于专家模型。

Conclusion: DF-LLaVA框架能够有效提高MLLM在合成图像检测中的性能，同时保持其可解释性。

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为跨模态几何校正 (CMGR) 的框架，以解决 3D 类增量学习中数据稀缺、几何错位和纹理偏差的问题。该框架通过利用 CLIP 的分层空间语义来增强 3D 几何保真度，并合成了具有区分性的纹理以抑制噪声。此外，还使用了一个基本-新颖判别器来稳定增量原型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 3D 类增量学习方法在极端数据稀缺的情况下表现不佳，因为存在几何错位和纹理偏差。虽然最近的方法集成了 3D 数据和 2D 基础模型 (例如 CLIP)，但它们受到纹理偏差投影和几何-纹理线索的不加区分融合引起的语义模糊的影响，从而导致不稳定的决策原型和灾难性遗忘。

Result: 该方法在 3D few-shot 类增量学习方面取得了显著的改进，在跨域和域内设置中实现了卓越的几何一致性和对纹理偏差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一种新的跨模态几何校正框架，该框架有效地解决了 3D 类增量学习中的数据稀缺、几何错位和纹理偏差问题。实验结果表明，该方法在 3D few-shot 类增量学习方面取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Conclusion: 这项工作为fMRI分析开创了一种新的几何深度学习范例，突出了双曲GNN在计算精神病学领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模电商中商品种类快速增长，导致类内差异增大，长尾商品增多，加上包装多样、遮挡严重和视角变化大等因素，使得仅依赖2D外观特征的方法性能急剧下降。

Method: 该框架首先使用大型视觉模型提取2D特征生成候选排名，然后使用轻量级3D特征感知模块评估3D特征质量并预测是否需要进行3D重排序。如果需要，则使用机器人3D检索Transformer，该Transformer包含一个生成几何感知密集特征的3D特征提取器和一个基于关键点的匹配器。

Result: 实验表明，RoboEye比现有技术(RoboLLM)的Recall@1提高了7.1%。

Conclusion: RoboEye仅使用RGB图像即可运行，避免了对显式3D输入的依赖，降低了部署成本。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双流掩蔽方法，结合3D空间网格掩蔽和渐进语义掩蔽，以解决现有旋转不变点云掩蔽自动编码器(MAE)忽略几何结构和语义连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的旋转不变点云掩蔽自动编码器(MAE)依赖于忽略几何结构和语义连贯性的随机掩蔽策略。随机掩蔽独立处理补丁，无法捕获跨方向一致的空间关系，并忽略在旋转时保持一致的语义对象部分。

Method: 结合3D空间网格掩蔽和渐进语义掩蔽的双流掩蔽方法。网格掩蔽通过坐标排序创建结构化模式，以捕获跨不同方向保持的几何关系，而语义掩蔽使用注意力驱动的聚类来发现语义上有意义的部分，并在掩蔽期间保持它们的连贯性。这些互补的流通过课程学习与动态权重进行协调，从几何理解到语义发现。

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和OmniObject3D上的综合实验表明，在各种旋转场景中，性能都有持续的提高，与基线旋转不变方法相比，性能有了显著的提高。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略可以集成到现有的旋转不变框架中，无需架构更改，确保了不同方法的广泛兼容性。

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Motivation: 传统超声诊断依赖医生经验，主观性强，诊断效率低。现有的通用视觉语言模型在超声医学任务中知识有限，多器官病灶识别泛化性差，多任务诊断效率低。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构，在跨越七个解剖区域的数据上进行训练，以执行超声报告生成、诊断和视觉问答（VQA）等多个任务。

Conclusion: EchoVLM有潜力提高超声成像的诊断准确性，为未来的临床应用提供可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and

Conclusion: 开放数据和模型以促进室内场景理解和生成领域的发展。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PRISM的混合方法，用于零售环境中的产品检索，该方法结合了视觉语言模型和像素级匹配方法的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像检索任务在零售环境中更具挑战性，因为不同品牌同类型的产品可能具有高度相似的视觉外观，并且查询图像可能以与存储的目录图像的视角显着不同的角度拍摄。CLIP和SigLIP等基础模型通常难以区分这些细微但重要的局部差异。像素级匹配方法计算成本高昂，并且会产生过高的匹配时间。

Method: PRISM包含三个阶段：1）首先采用视觉语言模型（SigLIP）从固定图库中检索出前35个语义上最相似的产品，从而显着缩小搜索空间；2）应用分割模型（YOLO-E）来消除背景杂波；3）使用LightGlue跨过滤的候选对象执行细粒度的像素级匹配。

Result: 在ABV数据集上进行的实验表明，我们提出的PRISM在top-1准确率方面优于最先进的图像检索方法4.21%，同时仍保持在实际零售部署的实时处理范围内。

Conclusion: PRISM通过关注全局模型经常忽略的细微视觉线索，能够更准确地区分具有高类间相似性的产品。

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AdaMM的脑肿瘤分割框架，专门用于处理缺失模态的情况，它优于现有方法，并在单模态和弱模态配置中表现出卓越的分割精度和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 在临床实践中，多模态MRI虽然被广泛使用，但是经常出现模态缺失的情况，限制了现有深度学习方法的鲁棒性和泛化性，尤其是在非主导模态组合下。

Method: 该框架以知识蒸馏为中心，由三个协同模块组成：Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module、Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module和Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和2024数据集上的大量实验表明，AdaMM始终优于现有方法，尤其是在单模态和弱模态配置中。

Conclusion: 对六类缺失模态策略的系统评估证实了知识蒸馏的优越性，并为方法选择和未来研究提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于强化学习的扩散模型图像编辑超参数自动调节框架，旨在解决现有方法需要手动调整多个超参数导致计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像编辑方法需要手动调整多个超参数，计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出了一种强化学习框架，将超参数搜索视为马尔可夫决策过程，通过近端策略优化算法动态调整去噪步骤中的超参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了搜索时间和计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了扩散模型图像编辑框架在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

Result: 增加合成数据集的多样性，特别是包含不同的视角和复杂的背景，结合精心调整的数据增强，是弥合领域差距的关键。最佳模型在Kaggle竞赛的隐藏测试集上实现了0.910的mAP@50。

Conclusion: 结果表明，纯合成训练方法具有潜力，同时也突显了完全捕捉真实世界可变性方面仍然存在的挑战。

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有深度学习肺分割模型在肺移植术前计划中的应用潜力，并找出其局限性。

Method: 使用三种深度学习模型（Unet-R231、TotalSegmentator、MedSAM）对32名患者的胸部CT扫描进行肺分割，并通过定量和定性指标评估性能。

Result: Unet-R231总体上优于TotalSegmentator和MedSAM，但在中重度病例中，所有模型的性能均显著下降。

Conclusion: Unet-R231在评估模型中提供了最准确的自动肺分割，但其性能在重度病例中显著下降，因此需要在严重的病理情况下进行专门的模型微调。

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Conclusion: OmniSegmentor是一个通用的多模态预训练框架，可以持续提升模型在各种场景下的感知能力。

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

### [109] [RGB-Only Supervised Camera Parameter Optimization in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15123)
*Fang Li,Hao Zhang,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的相机参数优化方法，该方法仅使用RGB视频作为监督，在动态场景中更准确、更有效地估计相机参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COLMAP虽然是静态场景中相机参数优化的主要方法，但其运行时间长，且依赖于动态场景的GT运动掩模。许多工作试图通过结合更多的先验知识作为监督来改进它，例如GT焦距、运动掩模、3D点云、相机姿态和度量深度，然而，这些在随意拍摄的RGB视频中通常是不可用的。

Method: 该方法包括三个关键组成部分：(1) 片段式跟踪滤波器，用于在RGB视频中建立鲁棒且最大程度稀疏的铰链状关系。(2) 异常值感知联合优化，通过自适应地降低移动异常值的权重来有效地进行相机参数优化，而不依赖于运动先验。(3) 一种两阶段优化策略，通过Softplus限制和损失中的凸极小值之间的权衡来提高稳定性和优化速度。

Result: 在4个真实世界数据集（NeRF-DS、DAVIS、iPhone和TUM-dynamics）和1个合成数据集（MPI-Sintel）上进行了实验，证明该方法仅使用单个RGB视频作为监督，可以更有效、更准确地估计相机参数。

Conclusion: 该方法仅使用单个RGB视频作为监督，在动态场景中更准确、更有效地估计相机参数。

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with
reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first
stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型主要依赖于大数据集中的统计规律，很少结合感知心理学的结构化见解。为了探索感知驱动的归纳偏置的潜力。

Method: 论文构建了一个合成的、参数化的几何错觉数据集，并评估了三种多源学习策略，将错觉识别任务与 ImageNet 分类目标相结合。

Result: 实验表明，将几何错觉作为辅助监督可以系统地提高泛化能力，尤其是在涉及复杂轮廓和精细纹理的视觉挑战性案例中；感知驱动的归纳偏置可以增强 CNN 和 Transformer 架构的结构敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果展示了感知科学和机器学习的一种新颖结合，并为将感知先验嵌入到视觉模型设计中提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

*Saket S. Chaturvedi,Gaurav Bagwe,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种新的针对检索增强生成（RAG）系统的攻击方法，称为对抗性指令提示（AIP）。AIP通过巧妙地修改指令提示来操纵RAG的检索行为，从而影响输出结果。与以往主要关注用户查询的攻击不同，AIP利用了指令提示的广泛重用和较少审计的特点，揭示了RAG系统中一个重要的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG攻击主要依赖于操纵用户查询，但在实际应用中，用户输入通常是固定或受保护的。因此，论文关注于利用更隐蔽且现实的攻击向量：指令提示。指令提示被广泛重用和共享，但很少受到审计，这使得它们成为攻击者操纵RAG行为的理想目标。

Method: 论文提出了一种对抗性指令提示（AIP）攻击方法，该方法通过生成具有自然性、实用性和鲁棒性的对抗性指令提示来操纵RAG的输出。论文采用了一种多样化的查询生成策略来模拟用户查询中的语言变异，并开发了一种基于遗传算法的联合优化方法来进化对抗性提示，从而平衡攻击成功率、良性任务效用和隐蔽性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AIP在保持良性功能的同时，达到了高达95.23%的攻击成功率（ASR）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了RAG系统中一个关键且先前被忽视的漏洞，强调了重新评估共享指令提示的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将从2D自然图像上预训练的通用视觉模型中的知识迁移到3D医学图像分割，尤其是在半监督设置下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督设置下，只有少量的标记3D医学图像和大量的未标记图像可用，如何利用这些数据是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的框架M&N，该框架逐步地将知识从2D预训练模型提炼到从头开始训练的3D分割模型。该方法涉及使用彼此生成的伪掩码迭代地共同训练两个模型，以及自适应地调整每个训练批次中有标签和无标签数据比例的学习率引导采样，以最大限度地减少不准确的伪掩码所造成的不利影响。

Result: 在多个公开可用的数据集上的大量实验表明，M＆N实现了最先进的性能，在所有不同的设置下均优于现有的13种半监督分割方法。

Conclusion: M＆N保持了模型无关性，可以与不同的架构无缝集成，确保了其适应性。

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Abstract: Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it
directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public
transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective
multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for
large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on
individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination
and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework
is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with
heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model
is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally
efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous
qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation
and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed
network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both
cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by
incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during
disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and
cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing
insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation

*Lanxiao Huang,Daksh Dave,Ming Jin,Tyler Cody,Peter Beling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）在渗透测试中的有效性和可靠性，并研究关键功能增强的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前尚不清楚基于LLM的智能体在渗透测试各个阶段的有效性和可靠性。

Method: 对多种基于LLM的智能体（从单智能体到模块化设计）在真实的渗透测试场景中进行全面评估，衡量经验性能和重复出现的失败模式。通过有针对性的增强来隔离五个核心功能能力的影响：全局上下文记忆（GCM）、智能体间消息传递（IAM）、上下文条件调用（CCI）、自适应规划（AP）和实时监控（RTM）。

Result: 结果表明，虽然一些架构本身就具有这些属性的子集，但有针对性的增强显著提高了模块化智能体的性能，尤其是在复杂、多步骤和实时的渗透测试任务中。

Conclusion: 有针对性的增强可以显著提高模块化智能体在复杂渗透测试任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment
penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack
phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple
LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic
penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring
failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional
capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM),
Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive
Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support,
respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component
coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective
execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery,
and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some
architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted
augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in
complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.

TL;DR: 现有的LLM驱动的Web代理在动态web环境中可以自主执行复杂的、多步骤的任务。然而，目前的评估主要集中在整体成功率，而忽略了中间错误，限制了对失败模式的洞察和阻碍系统的改进。这项工作分析了现有的基准，强调了缺乏细粒度的诊断工具。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个模块化的评估框架，将代理管道分解为可解释的阶段，以便进行详细的错误分析。使用SeeAct框架和Mind2Web数据集作为一个案例研究，我们展示了这种方法如何揭示标准指标遗漏的可操作的弱点，为更健壮和更通用的web代理铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 这项工作分析了现有的基准，强调了缺乏细粒度的诊断工具。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个模块化的评估框架

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform
complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current
evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate
errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic
improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of
fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular
evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages
for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web
dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable
weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and
generalizable web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks demonstrate how shared datasets accelerate progress toward AGI. Venture capital lacks a good benchmark for predicting founder success.

Method: Introduce VCBench, a benchmark with 9,000 anonymized founder profiles, standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks.

Conclusion: VCBench establishes a community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of AGI in early-stage venture forecasting.

Abstract: Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets
accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce
VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital
(VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top
investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision
of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1
firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles,
standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage,
with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification
risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).
DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the
highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public
and evolving resource available at vcbench.com, VCBench establishes a

*Meltem Subasioglu,Nevzat Subasioglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的AGI范式，将重点从外部模仿转移到基础认知架构的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于性能的AGI定义不充分，因为它们没有为研究提供清晰的、以机制为中心的路线图，并且未能正确定义真正智能的性质。

Method: 从人脑中汲取灵感，定义了真智能（TI）的六个核心组成部分，并提出了一个基于系统所展示的可测量组件数量的AGI五级分类法。

Result: 该框架提供了一个清晰的发展路径，其中开发里程碑直接解决了构建真正智能系统的挑战。第五级AGI在功能和实践上等同于TI。

Conclusion: 该论文综合了分析心理学、图式理论、元认知、现代大脑架构和人工智能领域的最新成果，为AGI提供了第一个全面的、基于机制的定义，为研究界提供了一条清晰可行的道路。

Abstract: The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to
two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus
replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current
performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,
mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the
qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human
brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to
the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True
Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied
sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a
highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and
lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize
results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,
five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable
components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with
developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building
genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5
AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it
and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and
given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,
higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and
practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from
analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures
and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based
definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research
community.

*Marko Tesic,Yue Zhao,Joel Z. Leibo,Rakshit S. Trivedi,Jose Hernandez-Orallo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文利用贝叶斯方法（Measurement Layouts）来推断多智能体系统在Melting Pot竞赛中的能力概况，并评估AI系统的合作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI agent中发展和评估社会能力需要在复杂的环境中进行，这些环境中竞争和合作行为自然产生。虽然博弈论可以解释为什么某些团队或智能体群体表现优于其他团队，但更抽象的行为（如遵守惯例）在训练和评估环境中更难控制。

Method: 应用一种称为Measurement Layouts的贝叶斯方法来推断多智能体系统在Melting Pot竞赛中的能力概况。

Result: 能力概况不仅可以预测Melting Pot套件中的未来表现，还可以揭示智能体的潜在亲社会能力。虽然较高的亲社会能力有时与更好的表现相关，但并非普遍趋势——一些得分较低的智能体表现出更强的合作能力。此外，在不需要亲社会能力的情况下，表现最好的竞赛提交更有可能获得高分。

Conclusion: Measurement Layouts提供了强大的预测准确性和可操作的见解，有助于以更透明和通用的方法来评估复杂社会环境中的AI系统。同时也为改进合作需求的注释和解决不同测试环境引入的偏差提出了建议。

Abstract: The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require
complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally
emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent
populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention
following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The
Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the
cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian
approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of
multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability
profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but
also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis
indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with
better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents
exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that
top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in
scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,
together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution
tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing
team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,
potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide
recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose
future research directions to account for biases introduced by different
testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer
both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more
transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex
social settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个新的数据集DeKeyNLU和一个新的NL2SQL pipeline DeKeySQL，以提高自然语言到SQL的转换精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL模型在任务分解和关键词提取方面存在瓶颈，现有数据集存在任务过度碎片化和缺乏领域特定关键词注释的问题。

Method: 提出了DeKeyNLU数据集，包含1500个QA对，用于优化任务分解和关键词提取。提出了DeKeySQL，一个基于RAG的NL2SQL pipeline，包含用户问题理解、实体检索和生成三个模块。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider数据集上的实验结果表明，使用DeKeyNLU进行微调可以显著提高SQL生成精度。

Conclusion: DeKeyNLU数据集和DeKeySQL pipeline能够有效提高NL2SQL的性能。

Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that
simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural
language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance.
However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword
extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL
generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning
models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of
domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500
meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and
enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with
DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three
distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and
generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model
configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate
that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy
on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在深度学习和人工智能领域取得了显著进展，展现出惊人的能力，被认为是实现通用人工智能最有希望的技术之一。由于LLM具备类人能力，因此人们越来越关注LLM是否以及在何种情况下像真正的人类一样思考和行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否像人类一样思考和行动，尤其是在理性方面（包括理论理性和实践理性）。

Method: 提出了第一个用于评估LLM综合理性的基准，该基准涵盖了广泛的领域和LLM。

Result: 该基准包括一个易于使用的工具包、大量的实验结果和分析，阐明了LLM在何处收敛和偏离理想化的人类理性。

Conclusion: 该基准可以作为LLM开发者和用户的基本工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine
intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the
most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like
capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants
across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether
and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents.
Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior,
both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e.,
practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for
evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains
and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental
results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from
idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a
foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验动态框架，用于自动工作流程构建，该框架能够根据任务的独特性质灵活地做出响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主工作流程构建方法主要依赖历史经验，导致效率和适应性受限。

Method: 利用Q-table学习优化决策空间，并评估当前任务进度，从而主动选择更适合每个任务的工作流程结构。同时，结合冷启动初始化、提前停止和剪枝等机制来提高系统效率。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法是可行和有效的。与现有最佳方法相比，该方法平均提高了4.05%，同时将工作流程构建和推理成本降低到现有方法的30.68%-48.31%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地提升任务解决能力，并降低工作流程构建和推理成本。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating
large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities
compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on
autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on
historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability.
We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction
should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To
this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow
construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the
decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of
historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task
progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent,
allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure
for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start
initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing
workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those
required by existing methods.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在医疗和金融等高风险领域中，由于监管、机构和隐私问题，数据共享面临重大障碍。虽然大型语言模型等生成式人工智能模型在开放领域任务中表现出令人印象深刻的性能，但由于不可预测的行为和用于基准测试的隐私保护数据集不足，它们在敏感环境中的采用仍然受到限制。本研究通过引入一个全面的评估框架，对最先进的DP文本生成方法和不同大小以及不同微调策略的LLM进行大规模的实证研究，并开发了一种为合成文本量身定制的会员推理攻击（MIA）方法，解决了这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域中，数据驱动的决策支持面临数据共享的重大障碍，现有的匿名化方法通常不足以应对非结构化文本，差分隐私（DP）提供了一种有原则的替代方案，可以生成具有正式隐私保证的合成数据。

Method: 引入了一个包含九个精选数据集的综合评估框架，这些数据集捕获了特定领域的复杂性，例如技术术语、长上下文依赖关系和专门的文档结构。进行了一项大规模的实证研究，对最先进的DP文本生成方法和不同大小以及不同微调策略的LLM进行基准测试。开发了一种为合成文本量身定制的会员推理攻击（MIA）方法。

Result: 高质量的领域特定合成数据生成在DP约束下仍然是一个未解决的挑战，随着领域复杂性的增加，性能会下降。使用公共数据集可能会使声明的隐私保证失效。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调迫切需要进行严格的隐私审计，并强调开放领域和专家评估之间存在持续差距，从而为在隐私敏感的高风险环境中负责任地部署生成式人工智能提供信息。

Abstract: Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and
finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory,
institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as
large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks,
their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable
behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking.
Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for
unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification.
Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the
generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we
address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity
metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific
complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and
specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of
varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality
domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an
unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases.
Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for
synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public
datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed
privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous
privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and
specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in
privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.

Motivation: 当前评估方法无法捕捉大型语言模型在自动化复杂、多代理工作流中日益增长的风险，如错误、突发行为和系统性故障。

Method: AgentCompass通过一个结构化的多阶段分析流程来模拟专家调试器的推理过程，包括错误识别和分类、主题聚类、定量评分和战略总结。该框架还通过双重记忆系统（情景记忆和语义记忆）进行增强，从而实现跨执行的持续学习。

Result: AgentCompass在关键指标上取得了最先进的结果，同时发现了人工标注中遗漏的关键问题。

Conclusion: AgentCompass作为一个强大的、以开发者为中心的工具，在生产中可靠地监控和改进自主系统。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating
complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors,
emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail
to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed
specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows.
AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a
structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and
categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic
summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory
system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions.
Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's
practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy
against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves
state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues
missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust,
developer-centric tool for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic
systems in production.

Motivation: 缺乏一个有原则的框架来理解这些想法是如何构建的。

Method: 使用七个认知标签（例如，计划、实施、验证）对模型生成的数学问题解决方案中的数千个句子和段落进行注释。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释LRM认知提供了一个理论基础的方法，并为未来更可控和透明的推理系统的工作提供了可能。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought
reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts
are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying
Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human
mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We
annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions
to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify).
The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained
analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed
annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in
LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This
framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM
cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent
reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有日志异常检测方法缺乏可解释性和泛化性，或者不可靠且不准确。

Method: 首先使用CoT监督微调来灌输专家般的推理模式，然后通过具有多方面奖励函数的强化学习阶段优化准确性和逻辑一致性。

Result: RationAnomaly 在关键基准测试中实现了卓越的 F1 分数，优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: RationAnomaly 通过结合 CoT 微调和强化学习，有效地提升了日志异常检测的性能，并提供了透明的分析过程。

Abstract: Logs constitute a form of evidence signaling the operational status of
software systems. Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the
reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face
significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability
and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often
hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we
propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by
synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our
approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided
supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a
rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase
with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical
consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally,
RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior
F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step
analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including
code and datasets.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的评估因基准饱和和污染而受到影响。我们提出了Nazonazo，这是一个由日本儿童谜语构建的经济高效且可扩展的基准，用于测试基于洞察力的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM评估存在问题，基准测试容易饱和和受到污染，影响了评估结果的可信度。Nazonazo旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 使用日本儿童谜语构建了一个名为Nazonazo的新基准，该基准具有成本效益和可扩展性，可以快速刷新盲数据集。

Result: 在120个谜语上评估了38个前沿模型和126个成年人。结果表明，只有GPT-5模型的性能与人类相当（平均准确率为52.9%）。对201个项目的扩展比较表明，推理模型明显优于非推理模型，而模型大小与准确率没有可靠的关联。

Conclusion: Nazonazo提供了一种经济高效、可扩展且易于更新的基准格式，解决了当前的评估危机，同时也揭示了一种反复出现的元认知缺陷，为未来的控制和校准方法提供了明确的目标。

Abstract: Benchmark saturation and contamination undermine confidence in LLM
evaluation. We present Nazonazo, a cost-effective and extensible benchmark
built from Japanese children's riddles to test insight-based reasoning. Items
are short (mostly one sentence), require no specialized domain knowledge, and
can be generated at scale, enabling rapid refresh of blind sets when leakage is
suspected. We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No
model except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a
52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that
reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size
shows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an
informal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of
verification failure: models often produce the correct solution among
intermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we
illustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo
thus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format
that addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent
meta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and
calibration methods.

Method: AC-RAG框架采用两个异构代理：一个通用检测器和一个领域专家解析器，通过对抗协作来迭代地改进知识检索。

Result: 实验表明，AC-RAG显著提高了检索准确率，并在多个垂直领域优于现有RAG方法。

Conclusion: AC-RAG框架有效地解决了RAG中的检索幻觉问题，并在多个领域取得了优于现有技术的成果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for
domain-specific LLMs, yet it is often plagued by "Retrieval Hallucinations"--a
phenomenon where fine-tuned models fail to recognize and act upon poor-quality
retrieved documents, thus undermining performance. To address this, we propose
the Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two
heterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and
a domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions. Guided by a
moderator, these agents engage in an adversarial collaboration, where the
Detector's persistent questioning challenges the Resolver's expertise. This
dynamic process allows for iterative problem dissection and refined knowledge
retrieval. Extensive experiments show that AC-RAG significantly improves
retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across various
vertical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents are limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements.

Method: The framework integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility.

Result: The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows.

Conclusion: OpenLens AI offers a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.

Abstract: Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities,
rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical
science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it
particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge
exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful
outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has
demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and
even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited
for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical
visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To
address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework
tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for
literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation,
enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality
control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research
pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and
traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing
health informatics research.

TL;DR: 本研究利用可解释AI建模框架，分析CPE对患者结局的影响，使用来自爱尔兰医院的电子病历数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前对CPE相关风险（如再入院、死亡和住院时间延长）的预测建模仍未充分探索，特别是使用现代深度学习方法时。

Method: 分析了爱尔兰一家急性医院的住院患者数据集，纳入诊断代码、病房转移、患者人口统计学、感染相关变量和接触网络特征。对几种基于Transformer的架构与传统机器学习模型进行了基准测试。预测临床结果，并应用XAI技术来解释模型决策。

Result: 基于Transformer的模型表现出实用性，TabTransformer在多个临床预测任务中始终优于基线，尤其是在CPE获取方面（AUROC和灵敏度）。感染相关特征，包括历史医院暴露、入院背景和网络中心性指标，在预测患者结局和CPE获取风险方面具有高度影响力。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个稳健且可解释的AI框架，用于分析复杂的EMR数据，以识别关键风险因素并预测CPE相关结局。Transformer模型表现出卓越的性能，并强调了不同临床和网络特征的重要性。

Abstract: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriace poses a critical concern for
infection prevention and control in hospitals. However, predictive modeling of
previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and
extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern
deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling
framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical
Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an
Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient
demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several
Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine
learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were
applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated
the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently
outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially
for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related
features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and
network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient
outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that
features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are
key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly,
reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study
presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data
to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings
underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the
importance of diverse clinical and network features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的架构框架，旨在增强多智能体系统 (MAS) 的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体系统 (MAS) 中增强安全性和可靠性。

Method: 使用 Sentinel Agents 网络作为分布式安全层，结合语义分析、行为分析、检索增强验证和跨智能体异常检测等技术。Coordinator Agent 负责监督策略实施和管理智能体参与。双层安全方法结合了 Sentinel Agents 的持续监控和 Coordinator Agents 的治理功能。

Result: Sentinel Agents 成功检测到攻击尝试，证实了所提出的监控方法的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供增强的系统可观察性，支持法规遵从性，并支持策略随时间演变。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing
security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of
this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed
security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large
language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,
and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee
inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and
access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the
idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator
Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In
addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on
these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,
and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This
dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel
Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic
and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt
injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy
breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural
design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different
families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected
into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully
detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the
proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system
observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution
over time.

Abstract: We present functions that quantify the contribution of a set of arguments in
quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs to (the final strength of) an
argument of interest, a so-called topic. Our set contribution functions are
generalizations of existing functions that quantify the contribution of a
single contributing argument to a topic. Accordingly, we generalize existing
contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a
corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to
set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of
arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across
different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application
scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体协作框架角色固定，缺乏适应性和动态知识整合能力。

Method: 提出一种知识驱动的自适应多智能体协作框架KAMAC，允许LLM智能体根据不断变化的诊断背景动态组建和扩展专家团队。

Result: 在两个真实世界医学基准测试中，KAMAC显著优于单智能体和先进的多智能体方法，尤其是在需要动态、跨专业知识的复杂临床场景中（如癌症预后）。

Conclusion: KAMAC框架能够有效提升LLM在复杂医学决策中的性能，通过动态调整专家团队来适应不同的临床需求。

Abstract: Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple
clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams.
Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate
expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent
interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder
adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations,
we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration
framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams
based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert
agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill
knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports
flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions
finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two
real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms
both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex
clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty
expertise. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: This study investigates the use of generative AI to support formative
assessment through machine generated reviews of peer reviews in graduate online
courses in a public university in the United States. Drawing on Systemic
Functional Linguistics and Appraisal Theory, we analyzed 120 metareviews to
explore how generative AI feedback constructs meaning across ideational,
interpersonal, and textual dimensions. The findings suggest that generative AI
can approximate key rhetorical and relational features of effective human
feedback, offering directive clarity while also maintaining a supportive
stance. The reviews analyzed demonstrated a balance of praise and constructive
critique, alignment with rubric expectations, and structured staging that
foregrounded student agency. By modeling these qualities, AI metafeedback has
the potential to scaffold feedback literacy and enhance leaner engagement with
peer review.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在推理时存在不一致性，即使面对相同的提示也可能产生矛盾的回答。为了解决这个问题，论文提出了多智能体共识对齐（MACA）框架，通过强化学习训练模型，使其倾向于选择与其内部共识相一致的推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时无法可靠地选择推理路径，导致结果不一致。

Method: 提出了多智能体共识对齐（MACA）框架，该框架利用多智能体辩论中的多数/少数结果来训练模型，使其倾向于选择与其内部共识相一致的推理路径。MACA 鼓励智能体在对等论证中扎根推理，从而产生比单轮多数投票更丰富的共识信号。

Result: MACA 在自我一致性、单智能体推理、基于抽样的推理和多智能体集成决策方面都取得了显著的改进。此外，该模型还表现出很强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，MACA 能够更可靠地释放语言模型的潜在推理能力。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating
contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can
mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs
struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes
under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as
an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce
Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that
post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal
consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These
trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning
in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating
richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents
to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer
insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving
substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K),
single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4%
Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA).
These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3%
on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more
reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型难以解决复杂的几何问题，缺乏高质量的图像-文本对数据集，且基于模板的数据合成方法泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入了带有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）来优化几何图像的标题生成，利用数学问题解决任务的奖励信号。

Result: 生成的数据集能够更好地捕捉几何问题解决的关键特征，提升任务泛化能力，并在多种任务中取得了显著的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法即使在分布外场景下，也能提升多模态大语言模型的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that
demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models
still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from
the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric
images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically
fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation
pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized
from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from
mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key
features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization
and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution
scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of
$2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks
with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with
$2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks
in MMMU.

Abstract: Unstructured data, such as text, images, audio, and video, comprises the vast

traditional data systems that rely on structured formats for computation. We
argue for a new paradigm, which we call computing on unstructured data, built
around three stages: extraction of latent structure, transformation of this
structure through data processing techniques, and projection back into
unstructured formats. This bi-directional pipeline allows unstructured data to
benefit from the analytical power of structured computation, while preserving
the richness and accessibility of unstructured representations for human and AI
consumption. We illustrate this paradigm through two use cases and present the
research components that need to be developed in a new data system called
MXFlow.

TL;DR: 生成式搜索引擎 (GEs) 利用大型语言模型 (LLMs) 提供带有网站引用的 AI 生成摘要，从而建立新的流量获取渠道，同时从根本上改变搜索引擎优化格局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了调查 GEs 的独特特征，我们通过与 Google 的生成式和传统搜索平台互动来收集数据，汇编了一个包含大约一万个网站的数据集。

Method: 通过检索增强生成 (RAG) API 进行受控实验，我们证明这些引用偏好源于 LLM 的内在倾向，即偏爱与其生成表达模式对齐的内容。

Result: 我们的实证分析表明，GEs 倾向于引用具有显着更高可预测性的内容，以用于底层 LLM，以及所选来源之间更大的语义相似性。

Conclusion: 我们发现，受过高等教育的用户在最终输出的信息多样性方面表现出最小的变化，但在原始网站经过润色后，完成任务的时间显着减少。相反，受教育程度较低的用户主要通过增强任务输出中的信息密度而受益，同时在实验组中保持相似的完成时间。

Abstract: Generative search engines (GEs) leverage large language models (LLMs) to
deliver AI-generated summaries with website citations, establishing novel
traffic acquisition channels while fundamentally altering the search engine
optimization landscape. To investigate the distinctive characteristics of GEs,
we collect data through interactions with Google's generative and conventional
search platforms, compiling a dataset of approximately ten thousand websites
across both channels. Our empirical analysis reveals that GEs exhibit
preferences for citing content characterized by significantly higher
predictability for underlying LLMs and greater semantic similarity among
selected sources. Through controlled experiments utilizing retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) APIs, we demonstrate that these citation preferences emerge
from intrinsic LLM tendencies to favor content aligned with their generative
expression patterns. Motivated by applications of LLMs to optimize website
content, we conduct additional experimentation to explore how LLM-based content
polishing by website proprietors alters AI summaries, finding that such
polishing paradoxically enhances information diversity within AI summaries.
Finally, to assess the user-end impact of LLM-induced information increases, we
design a generative search engine and recruit Prolific participants to conduct
a randomized controlled experiment involving an information-seeking and writing
task. We find that higher-educated users exhibit minimal changes in their final
outputs' information diversity but demonstrate significantly reduced task
completion time when original sites undergo polishing. Conversely,
lower-educated users primarily benefit through enhanced information density in
their task outputs while maintaining similar completion times across
experimental groups.

Abstract: Open data portals are essential for providing public access to open datasets.
However, their search interfaces typically rely on keyword-based mechanisms and
a narrow set of metadata fields. This design makes it difficult for users to
find datasets using natural language queries. The problem is worsened by
metadata that is often incomplete or inconsistent, especially when users lack
familiarity with domain-specific terminology. In this paper, we examine how
individual metadata fields affect the success of conversational dataset
retrieval and whether LLMs can help bridge the gap between natural queries and
structured metadata. We conduct a controlled ablation study using simulated
natural language queries over real-world datasets to evaluate retrieval
performance under various metadata configurations. We also compare existing
content of the metadata field 'description' with LLM-generated content,
exploring how different prompting strategies influence quality and impact on
search outcomes. Our findings suggest that dataset descriptions play a central
role in aligning with user intent, and that LLM-generated descriptions can
support effective retrieval. These results highlight both the limitations of
current metadata practices and the potential of generative models to improve
dataset discoverability in open data portals.

*Kainan Shi,Peilin Zhou,Ge Wang,Han Ding,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RecXplore是一个模块化分析框架，用于分解 LLM 作为特征提取器的流程，以便系统地探索每个模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提示、架构和适应策略上差异很大，难以公平地比较设计选择并确定真正驱动性能的因素。

Method: RecXplore 将 LLM 作为特征提取器的流程分解为四个模块：数据处理、语义特征提取、特征适应和顺序建模。

Result: 通过结合现有技术中的最佳设计，无需详尽的搜索，NDCG@5 相对提高了 18.7%，HR@5 相对提高了 12.7%。

Conclusion: 模块化基准测试对于识别有效的设计模式和促进 LLM 增强推荐中的标准化研究非常有用。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been
demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender
Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text,
extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models.
However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and
adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and
identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a
modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor
pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction,
feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new
techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling
systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public
datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques
without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and
12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of
modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting
standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）发现新定理的能力，提出了一个猜想-证明循环流程，该流程能够自动生成数学猜想并在Lean 4格式中证明它们。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作主要集中在解决现有问题上，而本文侧重于LLM寻找新定理的能力。

Method: 本文提出了一个猜想-证明循环流程，该流程利用先前生成的定理及其证明作为上下文，以实现上下文学习证明策略，而无需更改LLM的参数。

Result: 该框架重新发现了已发表但尚未形式化的数学论文中的定理，并通过验证。

Conclusion: 上下文学习对于神经定理证明是有效的，因为至少有一个定理在没有上下文学习的情况下无法被LLM证明，即使使用自然语言也是如此。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem
proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In
this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose
Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical
conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is
that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including
previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of
more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without
changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered
theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers
and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not
be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,
which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的哈希方法 Hashing-Baseline，它利用预训练编码器生成丰富的预训练嵌入，并结合经典的无训练哈希技术（主成分分析、随机正交投影和阈值二值化）来实现高效的信息检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的哈希方法需要昂贵的、特定于场景的训练。

Method: 结合来自最先进的视觉和音频编码器的冻结嵌入，并使用主成分分析、随机正交投影和阈值二值化等经典技术。

Result: 在标准图像检索基准以及新引入的音频哈希基准上进行了评估，取得了有竞争力的检索性能，且无需任何额外的学习或微调。

Conclusion: Hashing-Baseline 是一种有效的、通用的、无需训练的哈希方法。

Abstract: Information retrieval with compact binary embeddings, also referred to as
hashing, is crucial for scalable fast search applications, yet state-of-the-art
hashing methods require expensive, scenario-specific training. In this work, we
introduce Hashing-Baseline, a strong training-free hashing method leveraging
powerful pretrained encoders that produce rich pretrained embeddings. We
revisit classical, training-free hashing techniques: principal component
analysis, random orthogonal projection, and threshold binarization, to produce
a strong baseline for hashing. Our approach combines these techniques with
frozen embeddings from state-of-the-art vision and audio encoders to yield
competitive retrieval performance without any additional learning or
fine-tuning. To demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach,
we evaluate it on standard image retrieval benchmarks as well as a newly
introduced benchmark for audio hashing.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度神经网络(DNNs)逼近非局部守恒律解的效率，重点评估了架构选择及其对基于能量范数和计算时间的解精度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用深度神经网络解决科学计算问题，特别是逼近非局部守恒律。

Method: 通过系统实验，研究了激活函数选择（tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU）、网络深度（4-8个隐藏层）、宽度（64-256个神经元）和训练方法（配置点、epoch计数）对收敛特性的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，tanh激活在各种配置下产生稳定的收敛，而sine激活在少数情况下可以获得略低的误差和训练时间，但偶尔会产生非物理伪影。与传统数值方法的比较分析表明，优化配置的DNNs提供具有竞争力的精度和显着不同的计算权衡。此外，我们发现标准前馈架构在处理奇异或分段常数解时的基本限制，提供经验证据表明，由于标准激活函数的自然函数空间限制，此类网络固有地过度平滑锐利特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过为从业者提供DNN实现的经验指导，同时阐明必须克服的基本理论约束，以扩展其在具有不连续性的更具挑战性的物理系统中的适用性，从而为基于神经网络的科学计算的不断增长的研究做出了贡献。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

TL;DR: 神经网络在二元正确/错误监督下，无法同时学习良好校准的置信度估计和有意义的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在二元监督下学习置信度估计的局限性，解释神经网络幻觉现象，并论证事后校准的必要性。

Method: 通过严格的数学分析和全面的实验评估，包括负奖励训练、对称损失函数和事后校准方法。

Result: 证明这是一个信息论约束，而非方法论失败。实验揭示了普遍的失败模式，并验证了真实数据上的失败率。

Conclusion: 提出新的监督范式，如集成不合和自适应多智能体学习，以克服这些基本限制，而无需人工置信度标注。

Abstract: We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot
simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful
diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through
rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning
negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration
methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a
methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:
negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while
destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to
escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE
less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize
this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot
distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60
percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent
confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure
rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while
post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our
theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.
This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and
establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely
convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement
and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental
limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

*Ying Zheng,Yangfan Jiang,Kian-Lee Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为CausalPre的因果引导数据预处理框架，该框架可以在不依赖强因果模型假设的情况下，实现高效且有效的公平性解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作通常无法捕捉到对维持效用至关重要的更广泛的属性关系，因此本文旨在解决以下问题：我们是否可以利用因果推理的优势来设计高效且有效的公平性解决方案，而无需依赖关于底层因果模型的强假设？

Method: CausalPre通过将原本复杂的且计算上不可行的提取任务重新 формулировка 为量身定制的分布估计问题来提取因果公平关系。为了确保可扩展性，CausalPre采用了一种精心设计的低维边缘分解变体来近似联合分布，并辅以一种启发式算法，可以有效地应对相关的计算挑战。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CausalPre既有效又可扩展，挑战了传统的观点，即实现因果公平性需要牺牲关系覆盖范围来换取宽松的模型假设。

Conclusion: CausalPre框架在不依赖强因果模型假设的情况下，实现了高效且有效的公平性解决方案，并且在基准数据集上表现出有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate
outcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal
model, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional
constraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute
relationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a
fundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design
efficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong
assumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer
this question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective
causality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable
fairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair
relationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally
infeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To
ensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of
low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,
complemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated
computational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the
conventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off
relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.

*Ye Qiao,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 结合位置插值（PI）和后训练量化（PTQ）会降低长文本任务的准确性。提出了Q-ROAR，一种RoPE感知的权重稳定方法，以解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展LLM上下文窗口对于长程任务至关重要。PI方法和PTQ技术分别用于扩展输入长度和实现实际部署，但它们的结合会降低准确性。

Method: 提出了Q-ROAR，它将RoPE维度分组为几个频段，并对W_Q,W_K的每个频段的尺度进行小搜索。使用两个诊断指标：插值压力和尾部膨胀率来指导搜索。

Result: Q-ROAR在标准任务上恢复了高达0.7%的准确率，并将GovReport的困惑度降低了10%以上，同时保持了短上下文性能和与现有推理堆栈的兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR是一种有效的稳定方法，可以解决PI和PTQ结合使用时出现的问题，提高长文本任务的准确性。

Abstract: Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based
position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling
extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ)
enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades
accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation,
axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit
noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce
two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity)
and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To
address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that
groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search
over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to
preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context
dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes.
Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces
GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context
performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

*Herlock,Rahimi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FedAVOT，一种基于最优传输的联邦学习方法，旨在解决客户端部分参与导致的偏差和不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FedAvg在客户端参与不完整时，由于可用用户分布与优化目标分布不一致，导致更新偏差和不稳定。

Method: 将聚合过程建模为掩蔽最优传输问题，对齐可用用户分布和优化目标分布，使用Sinkhorn scaling计算基于传输的聚合权重。

Result: FedAVOT在非光滑凸联邦学习设置下实现了标准的收敛速度，且与每轮参与用户数量无关。在异构、公平敏感和低可用性情况下，即使每轮只有两个客户端参与，FedAVOT的性能也优于FedAvg。

Conclusion: FedAVOT通过优化客户端聚合权重，显著提升了联邦学习在客户端部分参与情况下的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training without sharing raw
data, but suffers when client participation is partial. In practice, the
distribution of available users (\emph{availability distribution} $q$) rarely
aligns with the distribution defining the optimization objective
(\emph{importance distribution} $p$), leading to biased and unstable updates
under classical FedAvg. We propose \textbf{Fereated AVerage with Optimal
Transport (\textbf{FedAVOT})}, which formulates aggregation as a masked optimal
transport problem aligning $q$ and $p$. Using Sinkhorn scaling,
\textbf{FedAVOT} computes transport-based aggregation weights with provable
convergence guarantees. \textbf{FedAVOT} achieves a standard
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent
of the number of participating users per round. Our experiments confirm
drastically improved performance compared to FedAvg across heterogeneous,
fairness-sensitive, and low-availability regimes, even when only two clients
participate per round.

Result: 该模型优于现有方法，并提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的模型能够有效识别H$\\alpha$观测中的异常，并为领域专家提供可解释的评估结果。

Abstract: The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided
astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be
processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring
the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分布式优化方法，通过随机局部协调降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布式优化方法在节点数量多时，同步成本高昂。

Method: 每个节点独立地均匀采样一个正则化项，并且只与共享该项的节点进行协调。对于图引导的正则化项，每个迭代的预期通信量降至2条消息。

Result: 对于凸目标，该方法实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$次迭代，在强凸性下，达到$\varepsilon$-解需要$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$次迭代，达到邻域需要$\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$次迭代。实验验证了收敛速度和通信效率。

Conclusion: 提出的随机局部协调方法在保证收敛性的同时，显著提高了通信效率。

Abstract: Distributed optimization requires nodes to coordinate, yet full
synchronization scales poorly. When $n$ nodes collaborate through $m$ pairwise
regularizers, standard methods demand $\mathcal{O}(m)$ communications per
iteration. This paper proposes randomized local coordination: each node
independently samples one regularizer uniformly and coordinates only with nodes
sharing that term. This exploits partial separability, where each regularizer
$G_j$ depends on a subset $S_j \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of nodes. For
graph-guided regularizers where $|S_j|=2$, expected communication drops to
exactly 2 messages per iteration. This method achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for convex objectives and
under strong convexity, $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to an
$\varepsilon$-solution and $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to a
neighborhood. Replacing the proximal map of the sum $\sum_j G_j$ with the
proximal map of a single randomly selected regularizer $G_j$ preserves
convergence while eliminating global coordination. Experiments validate both
convergence rates and communication efficiency across synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Motivation: 传统的静态分析通常无法防御采用代码混淆、多态和其他规避技术的现代威胁。相比之下，行为恶意软件检测（监控运行时活动）提供了一种更可靠和上下文感知的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的深度学习框架BEACON，该框架利用大型语言模型（LLM）来生成密集的上下文嵌入，这些嵌入捕获每个样本的语义和结构模式，并通过一维卷积神经网络（1D CNN）进行处理，用于多类恶意软件分类。

Result: 在Avast-CTU Public CAPE数据集上进行评估，该框架始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的行为嵌入和BEACON的总体设计对于强大的恶意软件分类是有效的。

Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的案例后缀预测方法生成的活动序列只有一个时间戳（例如，结束时间戳），这对于资源容量规划是不够的，因为我们需要推断资源何时会忙于执行工作。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的评估表明了该方法的多模型方法在案例后缀预测方面的优势。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种预测案例后缀的技术，该技术可以预测每个活动的等待时间和处理时间，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.

Conclusion: LiMuon优化器在训练大型模型方面表现出高效性，并具有较低的内存和样本复杂度。

Abstract: Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so
efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More
recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for
matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to
studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from
high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we
propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models,
which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory
than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has
a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the
smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer
mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial
intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy
this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition.
Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify
efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 A$^2$SL 的自监督学习框架，通过检索相关观测样本来增强目标生态系统的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法通常难以在数据稀疏或非典型条件下推广，而环境知识的发现依赖于带标签的特定任务数据，但通常受到数据收集成本高的限制。

Method: 引入多层次成对学习损失来训练场景编码器，该编码器捕获场景之间不同程度的相似性。这些学习到的相似性驱动一种检索机制，该机制用来自不同位置或时间段的相关数据补充目标场景。此外，为了更好地处理可变场景，特别是在传统模型难以处理的非典型或极端条件下，我们设计了一种增强自适应机制，通过有针对性的数据增强来选择性地增强这些场景。

Conclusion: 虽然本研究侧重于淡水生态系统，但 A$^2$SL 框架在各种科学领域提供了一种广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific
data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing
machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or
atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive
Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant
observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem.
Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a
scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios.
These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a
target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods.
Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical
or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an
augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios
through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case
study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen
dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL
significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in
data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater
ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in
various scientific domains.

Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying
Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of
uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of
evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers
unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating
our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a
Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated
empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than
Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world
applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze

### [159] [Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14577)
*Yang Xu,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) to address the limitations of existing Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) formulations in handling high-dimensional tensor data. SPMD-LRT operates directly on tensor representations without vectorization, preserving multi-dimensional spatial structure and leveraging low-rank tensor decomposition techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with high-dimensional tensor data because flattening destroys the data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden.

Method: The proposed SPMD-LRT incorporates first-order and second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective and uses low-rank tensor decomposition techniques (CP, higher-rank CP, and Tucker) to parameterize the weight tensor. An alternating optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT.

Result: SPMD-LRT achieves superior classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and prior tensor-based SVM extensions on diverse datasets (MNIST, images, fMRI neuroimaging).

Conclusion: SPMD-LRT effectively handles high-dimensional tensor data for classification by maintaining structural information and optimizing margin distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: The Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) is a recent advancement in
classifier design that optimizes not just the minimum margin (as in SVM) but
the entire margin distribution, thereby improving generalization. However,
existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with
high-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the
data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In
this paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for
High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates
directly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT
preserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and
second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,
and it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),
higher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An
alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to
efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core
tensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information
of high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved
classification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,
images and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior
classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and
prior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker
Machines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest
accuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling
high-dimensional tensor data for classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化和可解释的在线策略迭代强化学习框架，该框架围绕新型稀疏高斯混合模型 Q 函数 (S-GMM-QF) 构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展了早期离线训练 GMM-QF 的工作，提出的框架开发了一种利用流数据的在线方案来鼓励探索。

Method: 通过 Hadamard 过参数化进行稀疏化来调节模型复杂度，从而减轻过度拟合，同时保持表达性。S-GMM-QF 的参数空间自然地具有黎曼流形结构，允许通过在平滑目标上进行在线梯度下降来进行有原则的参数更新。

Result: 数值测试表明，S-GMM-QF 在标准基准测试中与密集深度强化学习 (DeepRL) 方法的性能相匹配，同时使用的参数明显更少，并且即使在稀疏 DeepRL 方法无法推广的低参数计数情况下，也能保持强大的性能。

Conclusion: S-GMM-QF 方法在参数效率和泛化能力方面具有优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces a structured and interpretable online policy-iteration
framework for reinforcement learning (RL), built around the novel class of
sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions (S-GMM-QFs). Extending earlier work
that trained GMM-QFs offline, the proposed framework develops an online scheme
that leverages streaming data to encourage exploration. Model complexity is
regulated through sparsification by Hadamard overparametrization, which
mitigates overfitting while preserving expressiveness. The parameter space of
S-GMM-QFs is naturally endowed with a Riemannian manifold structure, allowing
for principled parameter updates via online gradient descent on a smooth
objective. Numerical tests show that S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense
deep RL (DeepRL) methods on standard benchmarks while using significantly fewer
parameters, and maintain strong performance even in low-parameter-count regimes
where sparsified DeepRL methods fail to generalize.

Motivation: 传统的力匹配方法难以捕捉完整的热力学景观，因为对梯度进行拟合可能无法拟合低能量构象状态之间的绝对差异。

Method: 该研究将能量匹配项加入到损失函数中，并使用CGSchNet模型在Chignolin蛋白上进行了评估，系统地改变了能量损失项的权重。

Result: 能量匹配并没有在准确性上产生显著的统计学改进，但揭示了模型如何泛化自由能表面的不同趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，未来可以通过改进的能量估计技术和多模态损失函数来增强粗粒度建模。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into
biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required
to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a
promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching
approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a
model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy
conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy
matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the
Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight
of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically
significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how
models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future
opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy
estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.

TL;DR: PM-SFL: A privacy-preserving split federated learning framework using probabilistic masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy risks in SFL due to exchanging intermediate activations, especially data reconstruction attacks.

Method: Probabilistic Mask training to add structured randomness, personalized mask learning for data heterogeneity, and layer-wise knowledge compensation for system heterogeneity.

Result: Improved accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, especially under data and system heterogeneity.

Conclusion: PM-SFL is a scalable and privacy-preserving SFL framework that addresses data and system heterogeneity.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to
traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through
model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model
updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data
reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate
representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model
performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and
privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training
to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates
data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data
heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel
structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce
a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying
resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting.
Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image
and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves
accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with
particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

Abstract: Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease
screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are
prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their
substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such
platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering
(HD3C), a lightweight classification framework designed for low-power
environments. HD3C encodes data into high-dimensional hypervectors, aggregates
them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification
through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical
classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more
energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference.
Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training
data, and hardware error, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical
results, highlighting its potential for reliable deployment in real-world

Motivation: 现有的反学习方法过于注重效率和激进的遗忘，导致模型权重不稳定，降低了可靠性。

Method: CUFG 框架集成了由遗忘梯度引导的新梯度校正器，用于基于微调的反学习，以及一个从易到难逐步遗忘的课程反学习范例。

Result: CUFG 通过实现更稳定和渐进的反学习，缩小了与金标准 Retrain 方法的差距，从而提高了有效性和可靠性。在各种遗忘场景下的大量实验验证了该方法的原理和有效性。

Conclusion: 课程反学习的概念具有巨大的研究潜力，并为 MU 领域的发展提供了前瞻性的见解。

Abstract: As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the
ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing
attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and
aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular,
radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random
label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced
reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via
Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of
approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and
data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient
corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a
curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard.
These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by
enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both
effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of
curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers
forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive
experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and
effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer中的位置编码方法本质上是信号无关的，仅从序列索引中获取位置信息，而忽略了底层信号特征。这对于时间序列分析尤其有问题，因为信号在多个时间尺度上表现出复杂的非平稳动态。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）直接从输入时间序列生成位置嵌入。

Result: 在十个不同的时间序列数据集上的综合实验表明，DyWPE始终优于八种现有的最先进的位置编码方法，与生物医学信号中的基线正弦绝对位置编码相比，平均相对改进为9.1％。

Conclusion: 提出的DyWPE方法在时间序列分析中表现出色，并在计算效率方面具有竞争力。

Abstract: Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally
signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices
while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is
particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit
complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce
Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework
that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time
series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing
state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative
improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position
encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: To address the limitations of existing frameworks, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series
pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns.
This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to
spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these
limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework
that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving
inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise
Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving
the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for
representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency
Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies
across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module
(ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative
representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves

Motivation: 传统的点积注意力机制在处理连续和有序序列时，不能保证连续性和单调性，这对于帧同步目标至关重要。

Method: 提出了学习非负时钟来建模源和目标，并将注意力建模为这些时钟的相遇概率。通过路径积分推导，得到一个闭式、高斯状的评分规则，该规则固有地偏向因果、平滑、近对角对齐。

Result: 在Transformer文本到语音的测试平台上，该结构产生了更稳定的对齐，提高了对全局时间尺度的鲁棒性，同时匹配或提高了相对于缩放点积基线的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的注意力机制适用于其他连续目标，包括视频和时间信号建模。

Abstract: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that
explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many
sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on
positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity,
which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative
\emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting
probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form,
Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth,
near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The
framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel
decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for
autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In
a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable
alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or
improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize
applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal
modeling.

Motivation: 现有的动态采样技术不适用于工具学习中固有的多任务结构和细粒度奖励机制，导致学习效率低下。

Method: DSCL包含两个核心组件：基于奖励的动态采样（利用多维奖励统计来优先考虑有价值的数据）和基于任务的动态课程学习（自适应地关注于掌握程度较低的子任务）。

Result: 在BFCLv3基准测试中，DSCL比现有方法提高了3.29%的性能。

Conclusion: DSCL能够有效地利用工具学习中复杂的奖励信号和子任务动态，从而获得更好的结果。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

Motivation: 传统图压缩方法依赖于特定任务和GNN架构，限制了其可重用性和泛化性。

Method: 通过GNN优化一致性的角度重新审视理想的GC目标，推导出一个广义的GC优化目标。提出了一种基于最优传输的预训练图压缩方法（PreGC），通过混合间隔图扩散增强来抑制压缩图在特定架构上的泛化能力不足，并建立最优图传输计划和表示传输计划之间的匹配，以保持源图和压缩图空间之间的语义一致性。此外，还提出了一个可追踪的语义协调器，以桥接源节点和压缩节点之间的语义关联。

Result: 大量实验验证了PreGC的优越性和通用性，证明了其与任务无关的性质以及与任意GNN的无缝兼容性。

Conclusion: PreGC 是一种与任务和架构无关的图压缩方法，具有良好的泛化性和兼容性。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale
graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However,
conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific
supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and
generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit
the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and
then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those
traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this
optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)
via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and
architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph
diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability
of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty
of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan
and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic
consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing
graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation
of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic
harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic
associations through the optimized representation transport plan in
pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of
PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility
with arbitrary GNNs.

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation
response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale
transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the
decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to
traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently,
transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable
decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a
transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By
leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits
from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to
real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to
uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于锚图的多视图聚类(AGMC)方法存在两个问题：1) 直接将不同的锚图嵌入到一致性锚图(CAG)中，忽略了这些锚图中包含的冗余信息和大量噪声，导致聚类效果下降；2) 由于独立地进行后处理以获取聚类指标，因此效果和效率都会降低。

Method: OMCAL提供了一个基于核范数的自适应CAG学习模型，以对抗信息冗余和噪声干扰。然后，为了大幅提高聚类效果和效率，我们将类别指标获取和CAG学习整合到一个统一的框架中。

Result: 在普通和大型数据集上进行的大量研究表明，OMCAL在聚类效果和效率方面优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: OMCAL方法在聚类效果和效率方面优于现有的方法。

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: FlowCast-ODE: A novel framework for accurate hourly weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical, but current deep learning models struggle with error accumulation and temporal discontinuities in ERA5 data.

Method: Proposes FlowCast-ODE, which models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow, trained with a coarse-to-fine strategy and refined with an ODE solver. Includes a low-rank AdaLN-Zero modulation to reduce model size.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines in RMSE, energy conservation, and fine-scale spatial details. Comparable performance to state-of-the-art in extreme event forecasting and alleviates temporal discontinuities.

Conclusion: FlowCast-ODE effectively addresses challenges in hourly weather forecasting, demonstrating improved accuracy, stability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour
intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a
critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors
in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's
12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a
framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow.
FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state,
an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and
enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train
the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly
data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to
achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank
AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15%
without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE
outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and
better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more
fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons.
Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with
assimilation cycle transitions.

*Konwoo Kim,Suhas Kotha,Percy Liang,Tatsunori Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在数据量有限但计算资源充足的情况下，如何更有效地进行语言模型预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据量有限的情况下，增加epoch数和参数量最终会导致过拟合。

Method: 通过调整正则化方法（发现最优权重衰减是标准做法的30倍），并结合集成独立训练的模型。

Result: 通过结合epoching、正则化、参数缩放和集成缩放，使用比基线少5.17倍的数据，在2亿tokens处达到渐近线。将集成模型提炼成一个8倍更小的学生模型，并保留了83%的集成优势。在下游基准测试中实现了9%的预训练评估改进，并在数学中期训练数据上实现了17.5倍的数据效率提升。

Conclusion: 简单的算法改进可以在计算资源丰富的未来实现更高数据效率的预训练。

Abstract: Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model
pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and
no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches
of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we
significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization,
finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard
practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a
simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance
via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed
compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models
achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our
best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and
ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less
data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement
persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be
realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a
student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling
benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to
downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and
a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math
mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can
enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该模型在 Human 和 BioSNAP 数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并在 BindingDB 上保持竞争力。在虚拟筛选任务中，它超过了 LIT-PCBA 上的先前方法，从而在 AUROC 和 BEDROC 方面产生了可观的收益。

Conclusion: 这些结果验证了该框架在可扩展和结构感知 DTI 预测中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central
challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer
scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction
framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while
maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and
BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening
tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in
AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned
aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing
predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial
correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention
patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's
utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

Result: 通过实验，揭示了常用测试程序的局限性、agent联合建模对更好预测交互的重要性，以及当前state-of-the-art模型在面对分布偏移和对抗性agent攻击时的脆弱性。

Conclusion: STEP旨在将重点从“排行榜”方法转变为更深入地了解复杂多agent环境中的模型行为和泛化能力。

Abstract: While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and
effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for
evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to
unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing
frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP
-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a
unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and
evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We
demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1)
the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint
modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the
vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution
shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift
the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model
behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.

Motivation: 传统的 VNNs 基于协方差矩阵，存在密度高、无法编码条件独立性以及任务无关等问题，影响性能。

Method: 提出了联合学习网络参数和精度矩阵的优化问题，并通过交替优化（依次更新网络权重和精度估计）来解决。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上验证了联合估计相对于两步法的有效性。

Conclusion: PNNs 能够有效学习数据中的统计独立性，并具有稀疏性和保留协方差谱结构的优点，通过联合估计精度矩阵，能够提升模型性能。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph
determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and
stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically
dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a
task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations,
we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix
-- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical
independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral
structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an
optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the
precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially
updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound
the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each
iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to
two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

Motivation: 在能源市场和金融等不确定性系统中，随机预测对于有效的决策至关重要，在这些系统中，估计未来情景的完整分布至关重要。

Method: DST 递归地采样未来轨迹，并通过聚类将它们组织成树，确保每个阶段的非预期性（决策仅取决于观察到的历史）。

Result: 在纽约州日前电力市场中的能源套利优化任务中，实验结果表明，我们的方法始终优于使用来自更传统模型和无模型强化学习基线的情景树的相同优化算法。

Conclusion: 使用 DST 进行随机优化可以产生更有效的决策策略，通过比使用相同基于扩散的预测器的确定性和随机 MPC 变体更好地处理不确定性来实现更高的性能。

Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain
systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full
distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario
Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for
multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting
models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a
tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on
observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization
task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same
optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models
and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for
stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving
higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and
stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的多保真混合强化学习方法，可以在固定成本预算下优化策略，并在理论和实践上都取得了良好的结果。

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: G2LFormer: A novel global-to-local attention scheme for graph representation learning, addressing information loss in existing Graph Transformers (GTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GTs may suffer from information loss where local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism.

Method: Proposes G2LFormer, featuring a global-to-local attention scheme where shallow layers use attention mechanisms and deeper layers employ GNN modules.Introduces a cross-layer information fusion strategy.

Result: G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.

Conclusion: The global-to-local attention scheme is feasible and effective.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation
learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to
attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention
scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures
long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer
from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN
could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,
featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network
layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper
layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby
preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective
cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to
retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information
loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of
the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with
state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The
results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping
linear complexity.

TL;DR: DPANet性能最佳，因为它结合了时间和频率信息，并且交互式融合块至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了验证DPANet的关键组件。

Method: 通过严谨的消融实验，设计了Temporal-Only模型和Frequency-Only模型，并替换了交叉注意力机制。

Result: 完整模型始终优于所有变体；Temporal-Only模型和Frequency-Only模型表现明显不佳；替换交叉注意力机制导致性能严重下降。

Conclusion: 时间和频率信息的融合至关重要，交互式融合块是最重要的组件。

Abstract: We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components
(Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all
variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized
versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a
Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants
underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous
temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the
cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the
most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our
interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

Motivation: 当存在信号不可观察的隐藏节点时，估计的图可能会被破坏。现有的工作通过显式地考虑这些隐藏节点来改进图学习目标，但是对于“朴素的”、与隐藏节点无关的方法的鲁棒性分析仍然不足。

Method: 通过将约束等距属性（RIP）扩展到图学习目标中使用的Dirichlet能量函数，证明了朴素的图拓扑学习方法对低通滤波图信号的部分观测具有隐式的鲁棒性。

Result: 证明了基于平滑性的图学习公式（例如，GL-SigRep方法）在部分观测下可以恢复与观测节点相对应的真实图拓扑。

Conclusion: 通过合成和真实数据实验验证了研究结果。

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due
to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay
channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process
for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed
analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic
overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the
simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process
typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic
method exists.
  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,
we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the
critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty
hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is
broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from
a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits
the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with
highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs
to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful
trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also
incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token
sequences representing decays.

Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein
barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing
assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between
the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works
for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when
$q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter
diagram for generic transportation costs ($q > 1$), in particular those robust
to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two
applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric
space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both
scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our
generalized framework. Our Python implementation is available at this address:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that incorporate deep neural networks
(DNN), though powerful, often lack transparency. Their black-box characteristic
hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical
domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on
Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction
methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our
approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and
global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method
on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs
can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work
highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in
AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong
performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing
robust explanations.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics,
traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the
endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure
accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)
provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting
accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous
variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage
future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal
relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their
performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous
variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework
DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel
dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,
we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal
discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future
exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module
that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of
forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous
variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar
design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical
exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal
injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the
prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

Abstract: Social media has become a key medium of communication in today's society.
This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots)
to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to
such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language
models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the
effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder
transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater
accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater
adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for
generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa.
These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，能够在考虑客户端移动性的同时，有效降低能源消耗并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows
collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting
data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically
preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private,
whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on
the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data
sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of
limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource
allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy
consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce
the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate.
We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model
performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization
problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary
experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with
Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing
energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in
Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and
multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a
predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data
from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108
records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing
included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE,
followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised
ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost
were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest
model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories
(normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with
97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86%
ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in
capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for
early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications
for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven
strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

### [189] [Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14952)
*Zhuanghua Liu,Luo Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了平滑双层优化，其中下层问题是强凸的，上层问题可能是非凸的。重点关注随机设置，算法可以访问具有重尾噪声的无偏随机梯度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多机器学习应用（如训练大型语言模型和强化学习）中，随机梯度评估普遍存在重尾噪声。

Method: 提出了一种嵌套循环归一化随机双层逼近 (N$^2$SBA) 算法。

Result: 该算法能找到一个 $\epsilon$-平稳点，其随机一阶预言复杂度为 $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \\sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}} \\epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$。

Conclusion: 在有界方差的特殊情况下，上述所有上限都与已知的最佳结果相匹配。

Abstract: This paper considers the smooth bilevel optimization in which the lower-level
problem is strongly convex and the upper-level problem is possibly nonconvex.
We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased
stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in
many machine learning applications such as training large language models and
reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel
approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the
stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number,
$p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the
noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the
nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an
$\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known
results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.

*Carlos Barroso-Fernández,Alejandro Calvillo-Fernandez,Antonio de la Oliva,Carlos J. Bernardos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ISAC室内场景推理方法，该方法集成了Wi-Fi和5G信息，以提高覆盖范围和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案大多仅限于一种技术（Wi-Fi或5G），限制了可达到的最大精度。需要集成多种技术来扩大覆盖范围。

Method: 提出了一种名为FAWN的多编码器融合注意力波网络，该网络基于原始的Transformer架构，融合来自Wi-Fi和5G的信息。

Result: 在真实场景中构建了一个原型并进行了测试，结果表明大约84%的时间内误差低于0.6米。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不干扰当前通信的情况下理解物理世界。

Abstract: The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where
everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence
grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,
deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always
feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.
Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses
wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with
existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are
limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum
accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we
see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage
area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a
MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.
FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information
from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical
world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,
we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show
errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用目标函数的局部几何特性，无需任何超参数调整。

Method: 通过对不下降自适应梯度下降方法进行理论上的自适应调整，使其适应随机环境。

Result: 证明了在各种假设下，使用该步长的随机梯度下降的收敛性，并表明其在经验上与经过调整的基线方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的自适应步长策略，适用于随机凸优化问题，且无需手动调整超参数。

Abstract: We introduce a new adaptive step-size strategy for convex optimization with
stochastic gradient that exploits the local geometry of the objective function
only by means of a first-order stochastic oracle and without any
hyper-parameter tuning. The method comes from a theoretically-grounded
adaptation of the Adaptive Gradient Descent Without Descent method to the
stochastic setting. We prove the convergence of stochastic gradient descent
with our step-size under various assumptions, and we show that it empirically
competes against tuned baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了注意力机制在图结构数据上的应用，并提出了一个新的图聚类网络AGCN，该网络将注意力机制嵌入到图结构中，以实现有效的全局信息提取，同时保持对局部拓扑线索的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN过度强调邻域聚合，导致节点表示同质化。Transformer过度全局化，突出远距离节点而牺牲有意义的局部模式。注意力机制在图结构数据中的应用仍有待探索。

Method: 提出了Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN)，该网络将注意力机制直接嵌入到图结构中。AGCN包含一个KV缓存机制以提高计算效率，并引入了一个pairwise margin contrastive loss来提高注意力空间的区分能力。

Result: AGCN优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 本文通过全面的实证分析，揭示了GNN和Transformer在图聚类中的互补弱点。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks,
driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to
graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential,
remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize
neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations.
Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at
the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question:
Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address
this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the
complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated
by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a
novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN
directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling
effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local
topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast
AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV
cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin
contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的经验回放框架，可以更好地应对非平稳环境下的强化学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非平稳环境中，传统的经验回放方法难以区分策略变化和环境变化，导致学习效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种名为环境动态差异（DoE）的指标来隔离环境变化对价值函数的影响，并在此基础上提出了环境差异优先经验回放（DEER）框架，该框架使用二元分类器来检测环境变化，并应用不同的优先级排序策略。

Result: 在四个非平稳基准测试中，DEER 相对于表现最佳的现有 ER 方法，进一步提高了 off-policy 算法的性能 11.54%。

Conclusion: DEER 能够更有效地利用样本进行学习。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as
changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated.
Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error
prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's
policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under
dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of
Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment
shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of
Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that
prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.
DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies
distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more
sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks
demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms
by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.

TL;DR: 本文旨在通过建模多元时间序列数据中随时间变化的非线性时空相关性来改进多元异常检测（AD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现有的方法假设时间序列变量是（有条件地）独立的，这简化了真实世界的交互。我们的方法通过在潜在空间中建模联合依赖关系以及解耦边缘分布、时间动态和变量间依赖关系的建模来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们使用transformer编码器来捕获时间模式，为了建模空间（变量间）依赖关系，我们拟合了一个多元似然函数和一个copula。时间分量和空间分量在潜在空间中使用自监督对比学习目标进行联合训练，以学习有意义的特征表示，以分离正常和异常样本。

Result: 未在摘要中明确提及

Conclusion: 未在摘要中明确提及

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by
modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations}
found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an
anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time
series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time
series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing
approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally)
independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach
addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and
decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics,
and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture
temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a
multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components
are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive
learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate
normal and anomaly samples.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合无监督模式提取和可解释预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于人工定义模式的方法结构模糊，泛化性差；深度学习模型缺乏透明性。

Method: SIMPC 提取时间序列模式，JISC-Net 使用提取模式的初始部分作为输入，预测短期方向性运动。

Result: 在比特币和三个 S&P 500 股票的实验中，该方法在 12 个指标数据集组合中的 11 个中排名第一或第二，始终优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过揭示驱动预测结果的底层模式结构，实现透明的决策。

Abstract: Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in
11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming
baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell
signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent
decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive
predictive outcomes.

Conclusion: 结合基于演示的初始化和强化学习优化，为在纯探索不足的复杂多智能体环境中开发游戏AI智能体提供了一个稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from
sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper
presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning
with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a
multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and
Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention
mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited
significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies
despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid
methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from
rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid
approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,
substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed
high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture
enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining
training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based
initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust
solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments
where pure exploration proves insufficient.

Abstract: This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These hyperparameters allow for varying
sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving
overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel
metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns
within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model
performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined
with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while
improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach
provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and
model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set,
including input and output dimensions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的通信高效的分裂学习框架（ADC），通过在SL训练过程中减少传输中间视觉Transformer激活所需的通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决分裂学习中通信开销大的问题，尤其是在传输视觉Transformer激活时。

Method: 该框架采用基于注意力的双重压缩（ADC）方法，包含两种并行压缩策略：一是基于平均注意力得分合并相似样本的激活；二是丢弃最不重要的tokens。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ADC在显著降低通信开销的同时，保持了较高的准确性，优于目前最先进的SL框架。

Conclusion: ADC方法有效地降低了分裂学习中的通信开销，且不会损失泛化能力或降低最终结果，无需额外的梯度调整或近似计算。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 旨在解决 l0 正则化回归问题，并研究非线性压缩感知中的参数恢复问题。

Method: 提出了一种平滑的概率重构方法，并结合 Fefferman 和 Markel 定理进行理论分析。同时，实现了一种正规形式算法，用于在每个对称类中选择一个规范代表。

Result: 该方法在收敛速度上优于类似的基于蒙特卡洛的方法，并且在各种设置和信噪比下优于压缩感知算法。然而，精确的参数恢复即使在对称性方面也是不可能的，观察到教师和学生配置最初收敛但随后发散的反弹效应。

Conclusion: 该研究表明线性和非线性压缩感知之间存在根本差异。

Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized
regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the
computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima
of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves
convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing
algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and
signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and
GPUs and is freely available at
https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive
sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network
is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of
Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the
infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical
validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical
representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help
to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even
possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound
effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but
subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings
indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive
sensing.

*Martha Cash,Alexander Wyglinski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，该框架利用时间序列聚类来改进使用深度学习 (DL) 模型的互联网流量矩阵 (TM) 预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当跨所有流训练单个模型时，TM 内的流量通常表现出不同的时间行为，这会影响预测准确性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了两种聚类策略，即源聚类和直方图聚类，这些策略在模型训练之前对具有相似时间模式的流进行分组。

Method: 聚类创建更均匀的数据子集，使模型能够更有效地捕获底层模式，并且比将单个模型拟合到整个 TM 的全局预测方法更好地泛化。

Result: 与现有的 TM 预测方法相比，我们的方法将 Abilene 的 RMSE 降低了高达 92%，将 G'EANT 的 RMSE 降低了高达 75%。

Conclusion: 在路由场景中，我们的聚类预测还将最大链路利用率 (MLU) 偏差分别降低了 18% 和 21%，这证明了当 TM 用于网络优化时，聚类的实际好处。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve
internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models.
Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can
hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To
address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and
histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to
model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling
models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better
than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM.
Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to
92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered
predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%,
respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are
used for network optimization.
