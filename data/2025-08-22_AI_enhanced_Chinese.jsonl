Recently, research has focused on the\ntemporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all\npossible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art\nalgorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals\nby exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time\nintervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the\ncombinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this\npaper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel\nalgorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each\nvertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of\nredundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the\nquery interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both\nthe number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the\ninterval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.\nExperimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up\nto four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art\nOTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core\nanalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoreT\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4k\u6838\u67e5\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\u9876\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\u8fdb\u5165k\u6838\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u6709\u51dd\u805a\u529b\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u793e\u533a\u3001Web\u4e0a\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d85\u94fe\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u547c\u53eb\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u77ac\u65f6\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u65f6\u95f4$k$-core\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u67e5\u8be2\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u9694\u5185\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b50\u95f4\u9694\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709$k$-core\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoreT\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\u8fdb\u5165k\u6838\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u91cf\u4fee\u526a\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u9694\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u9694\u5185\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fb9\u6570\u548c\u95f4\u9694\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u90fd\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u3002", "result": "CoreT\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u9694\u5185\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fb9\u6570\u548c\u95f4\u9694\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u90fd\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OTCD\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCoreT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "CoreT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4k\u6838\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OTCD\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCoreT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to\nconduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to\napply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of\nGA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,\nexisting studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when\nsimultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal\nrecommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above\nchallenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework\ntailored to session-based recommendation.

Diffusion models, though\ncapable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps\nfor adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free\nblack-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces\nadversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional\ndiffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the\nmixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing\nall timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies\nattention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on\ngreen and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing\nmisclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR\nabove 30 dB across all tested datasets.

In this work, we introduce Few-Shot\nAdversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages\nthe in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ngenerate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that\nrely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,\nFSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,\nrequiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning\nthe LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP\nsynthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly\nembed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic\ncontent. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful\nexamples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which\nenables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across\nunrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health\nMisinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that\nFSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate\ndocuments.

However, existing\nmethods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user\nrepresentations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and\nuser-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in\ndownstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and\noverlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the\nCRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into\ntransferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability\nvia multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level\ntransfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and\nStandalone Retrieval for model-level transfer.

However, their\nsubstantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where\nfrequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the\ndominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\\% of query latency. Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements.

We propose S3LoRA (Safe\nSpectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and\nmodel-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models\nby inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce\nMagnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes\nthe structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude\ninformation. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a\nsharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and\npotentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk\nwithout sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA\nconsistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility\nmetrics and significantly reducing inference cost.

Furthermore, to enhance\nthe reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement\nstage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a\nMulti-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions\ntailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA\nintroduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization.

This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can\ninadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability\nregions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does\nthe curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment\nbetween generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional\ncompliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching\nframework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly\nincorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a\nrobust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the\ntrajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017\ndemonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ntext-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified\nflow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion.

Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of\nnoise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.\nRecent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.\nHowever, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,\nresulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the\ncomplete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and\ngenerative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest\nNetwork) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user\ninterest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest\nextraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain\ninterest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between\ninterest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user\ninterests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and\ninterest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented\ninterest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with\nthe latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted\ninterest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the\ngenerated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive\noffline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial\ndataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.\nMoreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B\ntesting.

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS\n(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent\noutdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While\nimage and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth\nmaps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective\nviews, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion\nmodels excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but\noften struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with\nrendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to\nguarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned\nresults when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach\nenhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The\npipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically\nconsistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we\npropagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and\nthird, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)\nusing the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh\nsurface.

Existing\napproaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal\naxis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and\ncomputational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained\nimportance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),\nthereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model\naccuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically\nacross both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero\ninformation for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this\noversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies\nunstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically\nrestoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our\napproach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,\nmaking it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.\nBy reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer\nsequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK\nnot only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage\nby over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an\naggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less\ndegradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its\nrobustness and effectiveness.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs.

To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise\nExperience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from\na continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually\ncurated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past\nsuccessful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved\nmodel performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves\nan average improvement of 6.1\\% on easy and 4.7\\% on hard questions. We further\ntest SEER on $\\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by\nQwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains\nof 7.44\\% and 23.38\\%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEER\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c60\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6f14\u793a\u6216\u4ece\u7cbe\u9009\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cprompt\u5de5\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aStepwise Experience Recall (SEER) \u7684\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c60\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728ToolQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSEER\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866.1%\uff0c\u5728\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.7%\u3002\u5728\u03c4-bench\u4e0a\uff0c\u7531Qwen2.5-7B\u548cQwen2.5-72B\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\uff0cSEER\u5206\u522b \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u53477.44%\u548c23.38%\u3002", "conclusion": "SEER\u5728ToolQA\u548c\u03c4-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either\noperate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the\ncomplementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D\nstructures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To\nholistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the\nfirst feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic\nmulti-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM\nfirst introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates\nmodality-specific features while preserving their unique representational\nstrengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to\nraise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the\nembedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to\ngenerate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the\ngeometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets\ndemonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves\ncompetitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite\nutilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional\nexperiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of\nincorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriMM is a feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from multi-modalities (RGB, RGBD, and point cloud) to generate high-quality 3D assets with enhanced texture and geometric detail, achieving competitive performance even with limited training data.", "motivation": "Most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms or restrict themselves to 3D structures, limiting the scope of available training datasets.", "method": "TriMM introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision, and a triplane latent diffusion model.", "result": "TriMM achieves superior quality in generating 3D assets, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail.

Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two\ncore components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary\nTarget Predictor (PTP).

In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability\nthat the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the\nprototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing\nprototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different\ntransformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples\nrespectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic\ninformation and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable\nguarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five\ndatasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA.

To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which\ncould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion\nspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV\nCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN).

Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly\nto collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,\npreferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior\ncontribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to\nunify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled\ntrajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert\ndemonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their\nsimilarity scores.

General capability\nbenchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;\ndomain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities\nand social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay\nattention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current\nbenchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,\nunfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation\non process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design\nparadigm for future benchmark innovation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u4f8b", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e5f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20", "method": "\u5bf9283\u4e2a\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u4e09\u7c7b", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u4eba\u6587\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5173\u6ce8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u6570\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u6587\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30"}}

Basketball,\nin particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,\nas ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with\nfrequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.\n  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first\nmultimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds\nwith synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball\nenvironment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves\nimproved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR\ndataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully\nsynchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We\nrecorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball\nplayers, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for\neach player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that\nleverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method\nconsists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal\ntracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult\nwith conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking\nperformance even under occlusion conditions.

SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible\nforgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for\nharmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,\nLLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM\nsubstantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high\ngeneral-purpose performance.

Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and\n28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and\nproprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation\nmethods.

RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval\ndatabase via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature\nretrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that\nguide precise mask generation using SAM2.

These models are often trained on\nnumerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic\ncreations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and\ndistribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a\ntraining-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating\nvideos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those\nconcepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly\nintegrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:\nSelective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise\nGuidance (ARNG).

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source\nof the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so\nfurther growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A\nword-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce\ncross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most\nfrequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and\noutput embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance\nreverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers\nfrom imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in\ndownstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show\nthat enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same\nfrequent-word benefit.

This tendency\nleads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises\nimportant reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further\ninvestigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation\nstrategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns\nthat reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These\nfindings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and\nmore sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling\nconflicting multi-modal inputs.

This\npaper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that\nselectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune\nemploys an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for\nfine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.\nEvaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains\nindicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency\ncompared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By\nconcentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune\nreduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased\ncomputational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across\ndiverse data characteristics and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioTune\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u66f4\u65b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "BioTune\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u5c42\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6765\u81ea\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e5d\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982AutoRGN\u548cLoRA\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cBioTune\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "BioTune\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Using\ncross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and\nphilosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim\nis that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of\nbecoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.\nTo address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian\nphilosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the\nAI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and\nindividuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the\nself-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens\npersonalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the\nrecursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by\ninfrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and\ntemporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,\nparticularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and\ndeployment concentrate value and decision-making.

To address these limitations, we propose an\nImage-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially\nenhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes\nafter archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding.

In this paper, we propose a\nBidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small\ntarget Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy\nsimultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.\nSpecifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design\na Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal\ndependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the\nbidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head\nfor detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the\ntraditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)\nloss.

However,\nexisting lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and\nrarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely\nrestricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,\ncurrent architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same\nconvolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature\nextraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel\nlightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet\nemploys heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency\ninformation while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model\nintegrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture\nlow-frequency global information.

These results confirm that fast, lightweight,\nand effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way\nfor scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild\n\\footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u4f53\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff08UICD\uff09\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u522b\u4ea7\u751f3.73\uff05\u300117.38\uff05\u548c3.70\uff05\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8", "conclusion": "\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5HAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def"}}

We curate and manually annotate a novel\nHebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches\n(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which\n1,812 instances (17.4\\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for\nintensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a\ntwo-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and\ndecoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary\nPDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization\ncharacteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform\ndata, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on\nsocial media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female\npoliticians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with\npronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events.
