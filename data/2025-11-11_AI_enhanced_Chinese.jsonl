During the past decades, most scientists adopted transfer learning and meta learning to solve the problem. Although notable exceptions such as ZeroMat etc. have been invented in recent years, cold-start problem remains a challenging problem for many researchers. In this paper, we build a zeroshot and privacy-preserving recommender system algorithm GreyShot using GM(1,1) model by taking advantage of the Poisson-Pareto property of the online rating data. Our approach relies on no input data and is effective in generating both accurate and fair results.

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status.

However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAGRAG\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1aLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u672a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u660e\u786e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e8eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u843d\u540e\u4e8eNaiveRAG\u3002", "method": "AGRAG\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u5c06\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff08MCMI\uff09\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002MCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u544a\u77e5LLM\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u68c0\u7d22\u67d0\u4e9b\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0cAGRAG\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "AGRAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Preprint exploring a new cognitive paradigm for autonomous planning", "summary": "We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty.

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks.

We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems. To foster reproducibility and facilitate future research, we publicly release our code on GitHub and the annotated Mastodon dataset on Hugging Face.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60 (ICL) \u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u68c0\u6d4b\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u5783\u573e\u90ae\u4ef6\u548c\u8de8\u4e8c\u5143\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u6216\u5206\u6563\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60 (ICL) \uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8f7b\u677e\u963b\u6b62\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u53d6\u6d88\u963b\u6b62\u73b0\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6 (TextDetox\u3001UCI SMS\u3001SST2) \u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684 Mastodon \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(i) \u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff1b(ii) \u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6216\u5b9a\u4e49\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff1b(iii) \u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4e49\u6216\u7406\u7531\u6765\u6269\u5145\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u7740\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5608\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06 ICL \u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy.

In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand.

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u4ec5\u6309\u5e74\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u505a\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bc6\u522b\u5e74\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528XGBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u524d15\u5929\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5e03\u4f26\u7279\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u662f\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u7684R\u5e73\u65b9\u4e3a0.981\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684R\u5e73\u65b9\u4e3a0.945\u3002\u5bf9\u5e03\u4f26\u7279\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u768415\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This research also develops a method to embed ontologies while preserving as much of the relationships and key information as possible, before feeding it into learning algorithms such as tree-based and graph-based convolutional networks. A case study shows how OntoTune's ontology-driven learning delivers performance gains compared with database system default query execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "OntoTune is an ontology-based platform that enhances learning for query optimization.", "motivation": "Using ontology to provide context in learning problems for query optimization.", "method": "Developing an ontology to connect SQL queries, database metadata, and statistics, and embedding ontologies while preserving relationships and key information.", "result": "OntoTune's ontology-driven learning delivers performance gains compared with database system default query execution.", "conclusion": "The ontology developed in this research is promising in capturing relationships and important determinants of query performance."}}

However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7ICL\u4e3aVLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7684ICL\u62bd\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "ICL\u8f85\u52a9\u7684VLM\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u3002VLM\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7406\u7531\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30VLM\u7406\u7531\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL\u8f85\u52a9\u7684VLM\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7406\u7531\u3002"}}

The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness.

DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation.

This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity.

In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality.

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5 2013 \u5e74\u81f3 2025 \u5e74\u82f1\u8bed\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4fb5\u8680\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Transformer \u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86 2013 \u5e74\u81f3 2025 \u5e74\u82f1\u8bed\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5171 LLM \u91c7\u7528\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a33\u6b65\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u7684 RNN/LSTM \u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52 AI \u6c61\u67d3\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL).

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework.

Jonathan Wu", "Ning Zhang", "Katsuya Suto", "Lei Zhong"], "title": "Compressing Multi-Task Model for Autonomous Driving via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic perception to jointly handle object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u526a\u679d\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5168\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u5171\u540c\u5904\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u9a76\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u7ebf\u5206\u5272\u3002\u867d\u7136\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cf0\u52d2\u7684\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u8981\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u79fb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u901a\u9053\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u8f7b\u526a\u679d\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u5934\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728BDD100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8632.7%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ec5\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff08Recall\u4e0b\u964d-1.2%\uff0cmAP50\u4e0b\u964d-1.8%\uff09\u3002\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u4ee532.7 FPS\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u526a\u679d\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAEs)\u5728\u6355\u6349\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6982\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u7684\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8etoken\u7684\u6216\u5608\u6742\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6982\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53e5\u6cd5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(T-SAEs)\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97SAEs\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cT-SAEs\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "T-SAEs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution.

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO.

However, existing methods lack in-depth modeling when dealing with interactions that generate only auxiliary behaviors without triggering the target behavior. In fact, these weak signals contain rich latent information and can be categorized into two types: (1) positive weak signals-items that have not triggered the target behavior but exhibit frequent auxiliary interactions, reflecting users' hesitation tendencies toward these items; and (2) negative weak signals-auxiliary behaviors that result from misoperations or interaction noise, which deviate from true preferences and may cause negative transfer effects. To more effectively identify and utilize these weak signals, we propose a recommendation framework focused on weak signal learning, termed HNT. Specifically, HNT models weak signal features from two dimensions: positive and negative effects. By learning the characteristics of auxiliary behaviors that lead to target behaviors, HNT identifies similar auxiliary behaviors that did not trigger the target behavior and constructs a hesitation set of related items as weak positive samples to enhance preference modeling, thereby capturing users' latent hesitation intentions. Meanwhile, during auxiliary feature fusion, HNT incorporates latent negative transfer effect modeling to distinguish and suppress interference caused by negative representations through item similarity learning. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HNT improves HR@10 and NDCG@10 by 12.57% and 14.37%, respectively, compared to the best baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHNT\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u8f85\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u4e0d\u89e6\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u79ef\u6781\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6d88\u6781\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "HNT\u4ece\u79ef\u6781\u548c\u6d88\u6781\u6548\u5e94\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0cHNT\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u672a\u89e6\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8f85\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5173\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u72b9\u8c6b\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f31\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6355\u83b7\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b9\u8c6b\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0cHNT\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9879\u76ee\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u533a\u5206\u548c\u6291\u5236\u8d1f\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHNT\u5c06HR@10\u548cNDCG@10\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612.57%\u548c14.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "HNT\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eCAD\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6FilletRec\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5706\u89d2\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5706\u89d2\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcFilletRec\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u59ff\u52bf\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u66f2\u7387\u3002", "result": "FilletRec\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b0.2%-5.4%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u4ece\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode.

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses.

Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets.

As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08M2S2L\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8698.5%\u300192.1%\u548c77.9%\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7AUC\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8620.1G FLOPs\u548c45 FPS\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u76d1\u63a7\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u6839\u636e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u540c\u4e00\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u7684\u6210\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9\u6216\u5b57\u8282\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6210\u5458\u90fd\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684UTF-8\u5b57\u7b26\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u5458\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4ece\u5b57\u8282\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u53ea\u9700256\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6210\u5458\u5373\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5916\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u7684\u6210\u5458\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684UTF-8\u3002\u4e0d\u662f\u6709\u6548UTF-8\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5047\u5b9a\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u6709\u6548UTF-8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u5230\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u6548UTF-8\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u6548UTF-8\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7a\u534a\u7fa4\u7406\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5305\u542b\u683c\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u7684UTF-8\u7684tokenizer\u603b\u662f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u683c\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u7684UTF-8\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ee5\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06token\u8f6c\u6362\u56de\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3aUTF-8\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u6574\u4e2atoken\u5e8f\u5217\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4UTF-8\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bb9\u6613\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d77\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba/\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5206\u6790\uff1b3) \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2) \u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3) \u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5219\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u6837\u672c\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDAUM\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u62cd\u5356\u62e6\u622a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u6548\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65f6\u62cd\u5356\u62e6\u622a\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAUM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728JD\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAUM\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5341\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DAUM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u65f6\u62cd\u5356\u62e6\u622a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply.

Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity.

A key step for CTR prediction is to learn accurate user representation to capture their interests. Generally, the interest expressed by a user is time-variant, i.e., a user activates different interests at different time. However, most previous CTR prediction methods overlook the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, resulting in what they actually learn is the mixture of the interests expressed by the user at all time, rather than the real-time interest at the certain prediction time. To capture the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, in this paper we investigate users' interest evolution from the perspective of the whole time line and develop two regular patterns: periodic pattern and time-point pattern. Based on the two patterns, we propose a novel time-aware long- and short-term user interest modeling method to model users' dynamic interests at different time.

In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\\% to 89.0\\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation.

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0ctransformers\u662f\u5426\u8fd8\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97ICL\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hapax\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7701\u7565\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u6bd4\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86vanilla\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u662f\u5426\u662f\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(ICL)\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53catransformers\u5728\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u8fd8\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97ICL\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHapax\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7701\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0evanilla\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728Hapax\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u6bd4\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u572821\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u768413\u4e2a\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86vanilla\u6a21\u578b\u3002Hapax\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u635f\u5931\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u66f4\u5c11\u3001\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u4e0d\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations.

While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation.

Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf(SVI)\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u5c45\u6c11\u901a\u8fc7\u57ce\u5e02\u8303\u56f4\u7684PPGIS\u8c03\u67e5\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ea\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf(SVI)\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0eGIS (PPGIS)\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u7684SVI\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0ePPGIS\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u6216\u65e0\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u7ec4\u4e25\u683c\u548c\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ea\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u5ea6\uff08\u4ee5\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff09\u8fbe\u523067%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6ca1\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523077%\uff0c\u4f46\u534f\u8bae\u5ea6\uff08\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff09\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f327%\u548c29%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136SVI\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u901a\u8fc7PPGIS\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u9014\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8303\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08CLPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaestro\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad86%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u9ad810%\u3002", "conclusion": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u548cCLPO\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines).

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDRAGON\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "DRAGON\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684CoT\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDRAGON\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DRAGON\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3.

However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains.

While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tool4POI: \u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Tool4POI \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u504f\u597d\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5019\u9009\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTool4POI \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728 out-of-history \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u8fbe 40%\uff0cAcc@5 \u548c Acc@10 \u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8 20% \u548c 30%\u3002", "conclusion": "Tool4POI \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning.

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective. MALinZero demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2, outperforming both model-based and model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMALinZero\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MCTS\u3002", "motivation": "MCTS\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u671f\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u56de\u62a5\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u6027bandit\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u548c$\u03bc$-\u5e73\u6ed1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u6027bandit\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0a\u754c(LinUCT)\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(\u5982\u77e9\u9635\u6e38\u620f\u3001SMAC\u548cSMACv2)\u4e0a\uff0cMALinZero\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MALinZero\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a$(1-\\tfrac1e)$-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u6a21\u5757\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Click data has been widely used as a low-cost alternative, and with recent advances in large language models (LLMs), LLM-based relevance annotation has emerged as another promising annotation. This paper investigates whether LLM annotations can replace click data for learning to rank (LTR) by conducting a comprehensive comparison across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both a public dataset, TianGong-ST, and an industrial dataset, Baidu-Click, show that click-supervised models perform better on high-frequency queries, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective on medium- and low-frequency queries. Further analysis shows that click-supervised models are better at capturing document-level signals such as authority or quality, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective at modeling semantic matching between queries and documents and at distinguishing relevant from non-relevant documents. Motivated by these observations, we explore two training strategies -- data scheduling and frequency-aware multi-objective learning -- that integrate both supervision signals. Both approaches enhance ranking performance across queries at all frequency levels, with the latter being more effective.

However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons.

In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy. The framework has considerable industrial potential to effectively reduce downtime and operating expenses through data-driven strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff08PdM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08FNO\uff09\u3001\u964d\u566a\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08DAE\uff09\u3001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8f6f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5236\u9020\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff08PdM\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86FNOs\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bDAEs\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u3001\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u4ee5\u53caGNNs\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u62a4\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528PPO\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe13%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u8d39\u7528\u3002"}}

This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers.

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions.

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods.

Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation. The findings suggest that MedGemma-powered classification systems can advance clinical radiograph triage by providing scalable and accurate abnormality detection, with potential for broader applications in automated medical image analysis.\n  Keywords: Google MedGemma, MURA, Medical Image, Classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e MedGemma \u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u653e\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e86 MedGemma \u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ece SigLIP \u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u3001\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684 X \u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7f\u7528 MedGemma \u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cMedGemma \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMedGemma \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8a\u653e\u5c04\u7167\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1.

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

An Empirical Investigation", "comment": "This work has been accepted by WSDM 2026", "summary": "Collaborative information serves as the cornerstone of recommender systems which typically focus on capturing it from user-item interactions to deliver personalized services. However, current understanding of this crucial resource remains limited. Specifically, a quantitative definition of collaborative information is missing, its manifestation within user-item interactions remains unclear, and its impact on recommendation performance is largely unknown. To bridge this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of collaborative information. We begin by clarifying collaborative information in terms of item co-occurrence patterns, identifying its main characteristics, and presenting a quantitative definition. We then estimate the distribution of collaborative information from several aspects, shedding light on how collaborative information is structured in practice. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of collaborative information on the performance of various recommendation algorithms. Finally, we highlight challenges in effectively capturing collaborative information and outlook promising directions for future research. By establishing an empirical framework, we uncover many insightful observations that advance our understanding of collaborative information and offer valuable guidelines for developing more effective recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u7528\u6237-\u9879\u76ee\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e5f\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9879\u76ee\u5171\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u9610\u660e\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u6709\u89c1\u5730\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96f6\u4ef6\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u6c89\u79ef\u7387\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\uff08HDRRAM\uff09\u4e2d\u5f62\u72b6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u589e\u957f\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8fd1\u51c0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u504f\u5dee\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7 RL \u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u975e\u6765\u81ea\u65b0\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc SFT \u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f25\u8865\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46 RL \u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u56de\u5fc6\u6b63\u786e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u201c\u4ee3\u7801 57.95 \u6307\u7684\u662f\u5c3f\u8def\u611f\u67d3\u201d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\u5728 SFT \u548c RL \u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u793a\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u201c\u4ee3\u7801 57.95 \u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e RL \u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u5e38\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4 RL \u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9010\u5c42\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cRL \u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e SFT \u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865 SFT \u6a21\u578b\u4e0e RL \u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bRL \u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u56de\u5fc6\u6b63\u786e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\uff1bRL \u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "RL \u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u6e90\u4e8e\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002"}}

However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540d\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u84b8\u998f\uff08TraCe\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u6e32\u67d3\u5230\u5176\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6865\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3LoRA\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f18\u53163D\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e38\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u9971\u548c\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b49\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5f53\u524d\u6e32\u67d3\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u76f4\u63a5\u4f20\u8f93\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u5c06SDS\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165TraCe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u5b9a\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u6563\u6865\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3LoRA\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTraCe\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "TraCe\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\uff08CFG\uff09\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3transformer-based\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\uff08UHeads\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6216\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3transformer-based\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\uff08UHeads\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "UHeads\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5927\u578bPRM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Given that users' complex and intertwined periodic preferences are difficult to disentangle in the time domain, recent research is exploring frequency domain analysis to identify these hidden patterns. However, current frequency-domain-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) They primarily employ static filters with fixed characteristics, overlooking the personalized nature of behavioral patterns; (ii) While the global discrete Fourier transform excels at modeling long-range dependencies, it can blur non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Wavelet Enhanced Adaptive Frequency Filter for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, it consists of two vital modules: dynamic frequency-domain filtering and wavelet feature enhancement. The former is used to dynamically adjust filtering operations based on behavioral sequences to extract personalized global information, and the latter integrates wavelet transform to reconstruct sequences, enhancing blurred non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations.

In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving. In this work, we design an additional Condition Parser to offer users more flexibility in their choices. Finally, Weight-Adjust Scoring Module is introduced to better accommodate the diverse requirements of various action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units.

However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u662fLLM\u7684\u71b5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5d29\u584c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5bf9RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6b63\u4f18\u52bf\u7684token\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u71b5\u5d29\u584c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u71b5\u5d29\u584c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9RLVR\u4e2d\u71b5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u4f18\u52bf\u7684token\u662f\u71b5\u5d29\u584c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u7528RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002"}}

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u533a\u5206\u786c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u548c\u786c\u6837\u672c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u786c\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u662f\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u786c\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528LLM\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u83b7\u5f97\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e3a\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\n3. \u5229\u7528LLM\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u786c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4ea4\u4e92\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u3002\n4. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u81ea\u968f\u673a\u8fb9\u7f18\u5220\u9664\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u7531LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMHNI\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u786c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence.

However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations.

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "wa-hls4ml\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc768\u4e07\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528hls4ml\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u9762\u5411Xilinx FPGA\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u7efc\u5408\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u5174\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1ML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86GNN\u548cTransformer\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4bML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u6210\u8d44\u6e9075%\u7684\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4bML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines.

We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models.

We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d22\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.\n  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.\n  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T.

PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions.

This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent \"effective weights\". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample.

Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge.

Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path.

Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions.

Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing.

While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a SSTODE \u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6 (SST) \u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u6027\u8d28\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b-\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u6d77\u6c34\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u591f\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u8f93\u8fd0\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u6d41\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6d77\u6d0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u8be5\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u660e\u786e\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6d77\u6d0b\u70ed\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u79ef\u5206\u5668 (EEI)\uff0c\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u533a\u57df\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSSTODE \u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002SSTODE \u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u70ed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u663c\u591c\u52a0\u70ed-\u51b7\u5374\u5faa\u73af\u5bf9\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SSTODE \u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027"}}

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration.

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity.

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness.

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness.

However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL). Q-RAG offers a competitive, resource-efficient alternative to existing multi-step retrieval methods for open-domain question answering and achieves state-of-the-art results on the popular long-context benchmarks Babilong and RULER for contexts up to 10M tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Q-RAG \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (RL) \u5fae\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 RAG \u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u578b LLM \u6765\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u7684 LLM\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (RL) \u5fae\u8c03 Embedder \u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6 Babilong \u548c RULER \u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8fbe 10M tokens \u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Q-RAG \u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization.

To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost.

To appear in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), Springer", "summary": "The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently.

However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5668 (EK-ICL) \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a ICL \u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 ICL \u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6b21\u4f18\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5728 AD \u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u88ab\u653e\u5927\u3002", "method": "EK-ICL \u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6570\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cEK-ICL \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a AD \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEK-ICL \u663e\u7740\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u548c ICL \u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL \u5728 AD \u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation.

However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict \"trustworthy-before-helpful\" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b83\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u201c\u53ef\u4fe1\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u201d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff1a\u6709\u76ca\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u9996\u5148\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u4fe1\u9608\u503c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u65e0\u5bb3\u6216\u8bda\u5b9e\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u65e2\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u53c8\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u81ea\u6b8b\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u533b\u7597\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u5e38\u5e38\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08SPA\uff09\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u6539\u8fdb\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u566a\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0cSPA\u6784\u5efa\u6309\u5b57\u5178\u987a\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u5f3a\u8c03\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u5dee\u8ddd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPA\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPA\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8d4b\u4e88\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u5176\u77ac\u65f6\u610f\u56fe\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6211\u4eec\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u201c\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u201d\u30022. \u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86 Skipper \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u30023. \u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u4ee5\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "1. \u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u30022.

Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text.

QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively.

While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff08CLFA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u5199Alzheimer's disease\uff08AD\uff09\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4bAlzheimer's disease\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u624b\u5199\u662fAD\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u6574\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u624b\u5199\u533b\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206AD\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671fAD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7b14\u753b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u5199\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks.

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks.

Code available at https://github.com/ajavid34/guided-info-diffusion", "summary": "Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08Smooth ECE\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u30022. \u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u503e\u659c\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u57fa\u4e8ef\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 128x128 \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 ResNet-101 \u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 2.13 \u7684 FID\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6563\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}
