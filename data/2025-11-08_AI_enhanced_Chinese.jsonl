Compressing\nthese data while preserving their absolute fidelity is critical, and leveraging\nthe massive parallelism of modern GPUs offers a path to unprecedented\nthroughput. Nevertheless, designing such a high-performance GPU-based lossless\ncompressor faces three key challenges: 1) heterogeneous data movement\nbottlenecks, 2) precision-preserving conversion complexity, and 3)\nanomaly-induced sparsity degradation. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes Falcon, a GPU-based Floating-point Adaptive Lossless COmpressioN\nframework. Specifically, Falcon first introduces a lightweight asynchronous\npipeline, which hides the I/O latency during the data transmission between the\nCPU and GPU. Then, we propose an accurate and fast float-to-integer\ntransformation method with theoretical guarantees, which eliminates the errors\ncaused by floating-point arithmetic. Moreover, we devise an adaptive sparse\nbit-plane lossless encoding strategy, which reduces the sparsity caused by\noutliers.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions.

While recent advances have focused\nprimarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the\ndetection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding\nsocial and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation\ntools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,\nor localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this\ngap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both\nfunctionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and\ninteractions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable\nfor training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral\necology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated\napproaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses.

Among the various forms\nof user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community\nparticipation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments\nthat are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting\nstylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.\nWe introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for\ncontrollable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video\nsegmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt\nconstruction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),\nrhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content\nextraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows.

However, it remains unclear whether this approach\napplies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is\nbecause interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine\nopportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided\ncannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated\nsimulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We\ncurate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray\nsequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train\nimitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively\nalign a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled\nsetup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our\npolicy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe\nintra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy\ngeneralized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to\nvaried initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that\nthe model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in\nsimulation.

Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes", "comment": "10 pages, 6 figures. Accepted to NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks 2025", "summary": "Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an\nopen-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features\nin one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility\ndegradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model\nutility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages\nlarge foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive\nfeatures, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates\nof sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model\ntraining. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models\non both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of\nthe original sensitive features.

Accepted with\n  minor revisions (10/10/2025); second round", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the\nglobe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance.

A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny\nconvolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible\ncomputational overhead.

Safety during\nincremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is\nadmitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset\nlies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic\nuncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound.

In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine\nTranslation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,\nAmharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the\ndatasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large\nrepresentation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are\nfocused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the\nmale gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in\nstereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic\ndepictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the\nlargest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.\nWe hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for\nlow-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.\nWARNING: This paper contains discussion of NSFW content that some may find\ndisturbing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u963f\u51e1\u5965\u7f57\u83ab\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u59c6\u54c8\u62c9\u8bed\u548c\u63d0\u683c\u91cc\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1 (MT) \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165 NLP \u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u89c6\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6570\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9762\u4e34\u7740 1) \u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 2) \u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u6c38\u4e45\u5316 \u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u963f\u51e1\u5965\u7f57\u83ab\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u59c6\u54c8\u62c9\u8bed\u548c\u63d0\u683c\u91cc\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1 (MT) \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5927\u91cf\u4ee3\u8868\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u7537\u6027\u6027\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u2014\u2014\u5728\u4eba\u540d\u3001\u52a8\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u522b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u3002 \u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u548c\u6709\u6bd2\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u80fd\u591f\u6fc0\u53d1\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8be2\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4eba\u4eec\u53ca\u65e9\u7f13\u89e3\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u3002"}}

Conventional explainability techniques, such as\nSHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their\nexplanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This\nstudy addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks\nthat recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit\nmodels. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via\nXGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation\nreweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP\nrebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate\ncalibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked\nagainst static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,\nF1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness\n(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,\nparticularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially\nimprove temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic\ngroups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including\ncounterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and\nproxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under\nreal-world drift conditions.

Across three models and a\nrange of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic\nhallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,\nachieving up to 9.7$\\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\\%$ lower hallucination\nrates, and 6.9$\\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while\nattaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.\nGRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding\nand knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from\ncorpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more\ntruthful and verifiable outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGraph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD) \u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u8f7b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4ece\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5219\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "GRAD\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken logits\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758ftoken\u8f6c\u6362\u56fe\u3002\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0cgraph-retrieved logits\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6a21\u578blogits\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8bc1\u636e\u5ef6\u7eed\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6db5\u76d6\u5185\u5728\u3001\u5916\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGRAD\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5185\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869.7$\\\\%$\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e868.6$\\\\%$\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866.9$\\\\%$\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u771f\u503c-\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "GRAD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or\nphotorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and\nappearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper\nadvocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for\nseamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization.

Simply satisfying formal constraints\ndoes not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.\nWe propose \\textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting\nas a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political\ninterests.

However, this leads to\nincomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress\nhas been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using\ngenerative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors\nand ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements\nshould be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,\nrepetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this\nwork, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates\nprogress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated\npointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing\nthe first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the\nstructural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward\nmonocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and\nthe first layout surface.

The KL divergence between the\ngenerated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each\nsample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and\nonline-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,\nwhile online-like samples follow online learning strategies.

Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth\nestimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video\nclips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict\nhuman social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors\nmatched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly\nimproved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with\ntheir embeddings.

Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting\nhigher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in\ncausal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on\nextending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order\ninteractions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure\nlearning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph\nwhich extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical\ntools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide\nidentifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov\nequivalence classes.

Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not\nbeen treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,\nlargely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,\nhere we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations\nof 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and\noutline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including\nWikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),\ne-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->\nmessages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by\ncapturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of\noutcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling.

We introduce a\nmulti-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the\nminimization of mutual uncertainty among agents.

At the foundation of this framework lies a\ngrid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,\nemerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon\nthis internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient\ncommunication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode\npartners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells\n(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint\nuncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional\nresilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to\n64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast\nbaseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%.

To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a\nnew foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for\nthoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,\nmultimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different\nmodalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10\npublic sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random\nResized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases\nsampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of\nstandard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's\neffectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic\ntasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest\nsignificantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained\nmodels. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training\ncombined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful\nand robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting\npoint for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be\nmade publicly available to foster future research and applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedDChest\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684Vision Transformer (ViT)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u80f8\u8154\u6210\u50cf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7120\u4e07\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7cbe\u9009\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MedDChest\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea10\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08CT\uff09\u3002", "result": "MedDChest\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u3001\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684ImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cMedDChest\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u80f8\u8154\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
