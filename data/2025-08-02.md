TL;DR: 本研究探讨了将大型语言模型 (LLM) 集成到房产预订平台中，发现 Mixtral 8x7B 在数据一致性方面优于 Mistral 7B，但成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线房产预订平台被广泛使用，并且在很大程度上依赖于关于住宿设施的最新信息，这些信息通常来自第三方提供商。然而，这些外部数据源经常受到不完整或不一致的细节的影响，这可能会让用户感到沮丧并导致市场损失。

Method: 对两个著名的法学硕士进行了评估：使用 QLoRA 微调的 Mistral 7B 和使用改进的系统提示使用的 Mixtral 8x7B。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B 在完整性（99.6% 对 93%）、精确性（98.8% 对 96%）和幻觉率（1.2% 对 4%）方面优于 Mistral 7B，产生的内容更短但更简洁（平均 249 个单词对 277 个单词）。

Conclusion: Mixtral 8x7B 在完整性、精确性和幻觉率方面优于 Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高。研究结果为在生产环境中部署法学硕士提供了模型质量和资源效率之间的权衡的实践见解，并证明了它们在提高住宿数据的一致性和可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

TL;DR: ElectriQ是一个电力营销LLM基准，通过领域知识增强和微调，小型LLM可以超越大型LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的电力营销客户服务系统存在响应时间慢、程序不灵活以及领域特定任务准确性有限等问题。大型语言模型（LLM）虽然具有强大的通用能力，但缺乏该领域的专业知识和同理心。

Method: 引入ElectriQ，这是第一个旨在评估和增强电力营销场景中LLM的基准。

Result: 在13个LLM上的实验表明，经过微调和增强的小型模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性方面可以超过GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ建立了一个全面的基础，用于开发为电力营销服务定制的LLM。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

TL;DR: TeQoDO是一种无需监督的本体构建方法，它利用LLM的SQL编程能力和对话理论来构建任务型对话本体，优于传统方法，并提高了LLM的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）被广泛用作通用知识来源，但它们依赖于参数知识，限制了解释性和可信度。在面向任务的对话（TOD）系统中，这种分离是明确的，使用由显式本体构建的外部数据库，以确保可解释性和可控性。然而，构建这样的本体需要手动标签或监督训练。

Method: TeQoDO：一种文本到SQL的任务型对话本体构建方法，利用LLM固有的SQL编程能力，结合prompt中提供的对话理论，自主地从头开始构建TOD本体，无需监督。

Result: TeQoDO优于迁移学习方法。

Conclusion: TeQoDO构建的本体在下游对话状态跟踪任务中具有竞争力，并且可以扩展以构建更大的本体，从而提高LLM的可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

TL;DR: detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms using a hierarchical classification framework


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources

Method: a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy

Result: outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird

Conclusion: The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [5] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架，该框架集成了基于嵌入的 ML 模型与 LLM，以预测图书的主题词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 已广泛用于分类和摘要任务，但它们执行主题分析的能力尚未得到充分探索。使用传统机器学习 (ML) 模型的多标签分类已用于主题分析，但在未见过的情况下会遇到困难。LLM 提供了一种替代方案，但通常会过度生成和产生幻觉。

Method: 集成基于嵌入的 ML 模型与 LLM 的混合框架，使用 ML 模型来 (1) 预测最佳 LCSH 标签数量以指导 LLM 预测，以及 (2) 使用实际 LCSH 术语对预测的术语进行后期编辑，以减轻幻觉。

Result: 实验结果表明，提供初始预测以指导 LLM 生成并强制进行后期编辑可以产生更受控且与词汇对齐的输出。

Conclusion: 引导 LLM 生成并进行后期编辑可以产生更受控且与词汇对齐的输出。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [6] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new knowledge graph integration method that uses label and triple matching to improve entity-matching accuracy, especially in diverse and complex contexts. It outperforms existing systems and includes a new dataset for evaluating triple matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Context matching in knowledge graphs (KGs) remains largely unexplored, which is important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in source, size, and information density. Existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and complex contexts need to be integrated.

Method: A novel KG integration method consisting of label matching and triple matching. String manipulation, fuzzy matching, and vector similarity techniques are used to align entity and predicate labels. Mappings between triples that convey comparable information are identified to improve entity-matching accuracy.

Result: The approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to leading systems and against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.

Conclusion: The proposed KG integration method demonstrates competitive performance compared to leading systems and achieves high accuracy across diverse test cases. A new dataset is introduced to evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文深入探讨了大型语言模型中的幻觉问题，提供了定义、理论分析、检测与缓解策略，并提出了评估方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中的幻觉指的是生成的内容不忠实于输入或真实世界的事实。

Method: 论文运用学习理论框架（PAC-Bayes和Rademacher复杂度）推导了幻觉风险的界限，并调研了幻觉检测策略，如token-level不确定性估计、置信度校准和注意力对齐检查。在缓解方面，讨论了包括检索增强生成、幻觉感知微调、logit校准和整合事实验证模块等方法。提出了一个统一的检测和缓解工作流程，并概述了幻觉评估协议。

Result: 论文区分了内在和外在幻觉，并为模型定义了幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 这篇论文为解决大型语言模型中的幻觉问题奠定了理论基础，并提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的时间感知RAG框架，并在ADQAB基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，解决了RAG在处理纵向查询方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的、语义驱动的检索方法没有能力为指定的时间段收集在主题相关和时间上连贯的证据，导致RAG在处理纵向查询时存在不足。

Method: 该方法首先将用户的查询分解为核心主题和时间窗口，然后使用专门的检索器来校准语义匹配与时间相关性，确保收集到跨越整个查询期间的连续证据集。

Result: 在ADQAB上的实验结果表明，该方法在答案准确性方面比标准RAG提高了13%到27%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的RAG框架，通过注入时间逻辑来解决RAG在处理需要跨时间跟踪实体和现象的纵向查询方面的缺陷。在ADQAB上的实验结果表明，该方法在答案准确性方面优于标准RAG实现。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models are costly and produce hallucinations.

Method: Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm

Result: combining a collection of language models in a multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding hallucinations.

Conclusion: The novel LMC algorithm significantly contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored much further in the future.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

TL;DR: Investigating feature universality in Gemma-2 language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale still converge on comparable internal concepts.

Method: Using the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and RSA.

Result: Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar subspaces interact similarly with language models.

Conclusion: These results strengthen the case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar, interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a foundation for cross-model interpretability.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的输入嵌入方法，以捕捉整个文档中提到的实体的位置，而不是只关注它们出现的范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前的方法只关注提到实体的句子，这不能捕捉到准确关系提取所需的完整文档上下文。

Method: 通过将实体表示为独立的段，独立于它们在文档中的位置，从而利用全局关系和多句推理。

Result: 该方法在 DocRED、Re-DocRED 和 REBEL 三个基准关系抽取数据集上进行了测试，实验结果表明该方法能够准确预测文档级别设置中实体间的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法准确地预测了文档级别设置中实体间的关系，并在关系抽取方面推进了全局上下文建模和多句推理，从而增强了关系检测，从而在需要综合实体级别见解和可解释性的实际 NLP 应用中实现改进的性能。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

### [12] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their registrations prior to the trial. They found that the best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants to unnecessary risks.

Method: Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction.

Result: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across 12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%.

Conclusion: Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported safety results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MusT-RAG框架，通过构建音乐知识库和优化检索增强生成，提升大型语言模型在音乐问答任务上的性能，实验证明该方法优于传统微调，且更有效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在各个领域都表现出了卓越的能力。虽然它们在各种任务上表现出强大的零样本性能，但由于其训练数据中特定于音乐的知识比例相对较小，LLM在音乐相关应用中的有效性仍然有限。

Method: 提出了MusT-RAG，一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的综合框架，以使通用LLM适应仅文本音乐问答（MQA）任务。为了优化RAG在音乐领域，我们（1）提出了MusWikiDB，一个用于检索阶段的音乐专用向量数据库，以及（2）在推理和微调过程中利用上下文信息，以有效地将通用LLM转换为音乐专用模型。

Result: MusT-RAG在增强LLM的音乐领域适应能力方面明显优于传统的微调方法，在领域内和领域外MQA基准测试中均表现出持续的改进。此外，我们的MusWikiDB被证明比一般的维基百科语料库更有效，提供了卓越的性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG显著优于传统微调方法，增强了LLM的音乐领域适应能力，并在领域内和领域外MQA基准测试中显示出持续的改进。MusWikiDB被证明比一般的维基百科语料库更有效，提供了卓越的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our

*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Jiahong Liu,Linxiao Cao,Wei Ji,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey provides a structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs, focusing on vector quantization (VQ) techniques. It identifies challenges and emerging research directions, bridging the gap between traditional VQ and modern LLM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems.

Method: We categorize 8 representative VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM pipelines.

Result: We discuss existing research in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints.

Conclusion: This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

### [15] [MRGSEM-Sum: An Unsupervised Multi-document Summarization Framework based on Multi-Relational Graphs and Structural Entropy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23400)
*Yongbing Zhang,Fang Nan,Shengxiang Gao,Yuxin Huang,Kaiwen Tan,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无监督多文档摘要框架，该框架使用多关系图和结构熵最小化来解决现有方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只考虑单关系图，需要预定义数量的聚类，这阻碍了它们充分表示丰富的关系信息和自适应地划分句子组以减少冗余的能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于多关系图和结构熵最小化的无监督多文档摘要框架 MRGSEM-Sum。

Result: 构建了一个多关系图，该图集成了句子之间的语义和语篇关系，全面建模了文档中句子之间复杂而动态的连接。然后应用二维结构熵最小化算法进行聚类，自动确定最佳聚类数量，有效地将句子组织成连贯的组。引入了一种位置感知压缩机制来提炼每个集群，生成简洁且信息丰富的摘要。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum 在四个基准数据集上始终优于以前的无监督方法，在某些情况下，其性能与监督模型和大型语言模型相当。人工评估表明，MRGSEM-Sum 生成的摘要显示出高度的一致性和覆盖率，接近人类水平的质量。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices, simpler metrics have stronger predictive signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether sentiment derived from social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements.

Method: Employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model.

Result: Social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices.

Conclusion: Social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices, while simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends, exhibit stronger predictive signals.

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言RAG系统中prompt翻译策略对分类任务的影响，发现优化的prompt策略可以显著提高知识共享和任务性能，尤其对于低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)的多语言能力取得了进展，但它们在不同语言和任务中的表现差异很大。在多语言检索增强生成(RAG)系统中，知识库(KB)通常从高资源语言(如英语)共享到低资源语言，导致从KB检索到的信息与上下文的其余部分使用不同的语言。在这种情况下，两种常见的做法是预翻译以创建单语prompt和跨语言prompt以进行直接推断。然而，这些选择的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 系统地评估了不同prompt翻译策略对多语言系统中RAG增强的LLM分类任务的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的prompt策略可以显著提高跨语言的知识共享，从而提高下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 优化的prompt策略可以显著提高跨语言的知识共享，从而提高下游分类任务的性能。研究结果提倡更广泛地利用多语言资源共享和非英语语言的跨语言prompt优化，特别是低资源语言。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

*Brittney Exline,Melanie Duffin,Brittany Harbison,Chrissa da Gomez,David Joyner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how native vs. non-native English speaker status affects peer feedback in online U.S. computing courses. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less positive sentiment in return.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many international students in U.S. graduate-level CS programs take online courses where peer feedback is used. Since these courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker status affects peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based computing courses.

Method: Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language background.

Result: native English speakers rate feedback less favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less positive sentiment in return.

Conclusion: native English speakers rate feedback less favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

### [19] [Hierarchical Memory for High-Efficiency Long-Term Reasoning in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22925)
*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical memory architecture (H-MEM) for LLM Agents that improves long-term dialogue performance by organizing and efficiently retrieving memories in a multi-level fashion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Recent works often fall short in structured memory organization and efficient retrieval.

Method: We propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer. During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient, layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.

Result: Our approach consistently outperforms five baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture outperforms five baseline methods in long-term dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前基准测试侧重于噪声鲁棒性等广泛方面，但缺乏对文档利用的系统和细粒度评估框架。

Method: 这篇论文提出了一个基于占位符的创新方法，以解耦LLM的参数知识和外部知识的贡献。

Result: 实验证明了代表性LLM在RAG系统的生成能力方面的局限性，尤其是在误差弹性和上下文忠实性方面。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，大型语言模型在RAG系统的生成能力方面存在局限性，尤其是在误差弹性和上下文忠实性方面。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT提示可以提高大型语言模型在多步骤任务中的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Chain-of-thought (CoT) 提示提高了大型语言模型在多步骤任务中的准确性，但生成的“想法”是否反映了真实的内部推理过程尚不清楚。

Method: 结合稀疏自动编码器与激活补丁，从Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B中提取单义特征，同时它们在CoT和plain (noCoT) 提示下处理GSM8K数学问题。

Result: 将一小部分CoT推理特征交换到noCoT运行中，显著提高了2.8B模型中的答案对数概率，但在70M中没有可靠的效果，揭示了清晰的规模阈值。CoT还在更大的模型中导致显著更高的激活稀疏性和特征可解释性分数，表明更模块化的内部计算。例如，模型生成正确答案的置信度从1.2提高到4.3。

Conclusion: CoT可以诱导高容量LLM中更易于解释的内部结构，验证了其作为结构化提示方法的角色。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学大型语言模型在眼科诊断中起着关键作用，但它们的准确性受到幻觉的限制，这些幻觉源于有限的眼科知识、不足的视觉定位和推理能力以及多模态眼科数据的稀缺。

Method: 提出了一个以智能体为中心的三阶段框架，包括知识水平检索阶段、任务水平案例研究阶段和结果水平验证阶段。

Result: 多智能体框架显著减轻了两种类型的幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架显著减轻了幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled datasets.

Method: develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing data that can be safely shared

Result: creating a taxonomy of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3 text generation Large Language Models (LLMs)

Conclusion: We release our dataset and code to foster reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoE-Ops, a collaboration-of-expert framework that improves AIOps performance by incorporating a large language model task classifier and a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism.


<details>

Motivation: constrained by domain-specific knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a specific task. combining multiple models can achieve more efficient results

Method: proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented generation mechanism is introduced

Result: CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Conclusion: CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从技术文档中进行问答 (QA) 通常涉及答案存在于图形（例如流程图或流程图）中的问题。基于文本的检索增强生成 (RAG) 系统可能无法回答此类问题。

Method: 利用从视觉大型语言模型 (VLM) 获得的流程图的图表示，并将其纳入基于文本的 RAG 系统中。

Result: 结果表明，使用微调的 VLM 模型获得的图表示相对于ground truth具有较低的编辑距离，这说明了这些表示对于流程图图像的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过使用基于文本的嵌入模型，包括电信领域调整后的模型，实现了良好的检索性能，并且减轻了推理中对 VLM 的需求，这对于部署的 QA 系统来说是一项重要的成本优势。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE框架通过事实检查、强化学习和可解释性分析，显著提高了大型语言模型推理的事实准确性，并在多个基准测试中保持或提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)中存在一个关键的漏洞：尽管最终答案正确，但在中间推理步骤中普遍存在事实不准确的情况。这种现象在高风险领域(包括医疗保健、法律分析和科学研究)中构成了重大风险，在这些领域中，错误但自信地呈现的推理可能会误导用户做出危险的决定。

Method: RELIANCE框架整合了三个核心组件：(1)一个专门的事实检查分类器，该分类器经过反事实增强数据的训练，以检测推理链中细微的事实不一致；(2)一种群体相对策略优化(GRPO)强化学习方法，该方法通过多维奖励来平衡事实性、连贯性和结构正确性；(3)一个机械可解释性模块，用于检查事实性改进如何在推理过程中的模型激活中体现出来。

Result: 在十个最先进的模型中进行的广泛评估揭示了令人担忧的模式：即使是像Claude-3.7和GPT-o1这样的领先模型，其推理事实准确率也分别只有81.93%和82.57%。

Conclusion: RELIANCE显著提高了事实的稳健性（提高了高达49.90%），同时保持或提高了在具有挑战性的基准测试（包括Math-500、AIME-2024和GPQA）上的性能。此外，我们的激活水平分析提供了关于事实增强如何重塑模型架构中的推理轨迹的可操作的见解，为未来通过激活引导优化明确针对事实稳健性的训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT is a temporal survival analysis framework that processes clinical reports to estimate patient-specific risk scores, achieving a C-index of 0.75 on an oncology dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form.

Method: SigBERT processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model to estimate patient-specific risk scores.

Result: The model was trained and evaluated on a real-world oncology dataset from the L'éon B'erard Center corpus, with a C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort.

Conclusion: SigBERT integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing narrative-based survival analysis.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the

efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated

TL;DR: This study introduces an efficient validation process using NLP and adaptive sampling, reducing review time and resources while maintaining precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: enhance analyses conducted with large claims databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based algorithms used to identify health outcomes

Method: use of natural language processing (NLP) to reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient precision

Result: NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by 40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision in derived measurement characteristics.

Conclusion: This approach could facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of find-ings derived from database studies.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Conclusion: 提出了一个现代的任意性理论，将其视为控制和关怀的核心中立算子，并探索了其在人工智能系统中的应用。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Motivation: there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in

compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn

We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using In-Context Learning (ICL) with LLMs for Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) without fine-tuning, achieving competitive results by automatically generating task-specific prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: investigates the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP without model fine-tuning

Method: a method that automatically generates task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database

Result: achieves competitive results, with F1 scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL

Conclusion: ICL offers a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for domain-specific FSP tasks.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARoPE是一种RoPE的泛化，它动态生成依赖于token嵌入的特定于head的频率模式，在性能上优于RoPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE依赖于静态的、独立于输入的正弦频率模式，限制了其对上下文敏感关系进行建模的能力。

Method: 提出了一种CARoPE（上下文感知旋转位置嵌入），它是RoPE的一种新的泛化，可以动态生成依赖于token嵌入的特定于head的频率模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，即使在更长的上下文长度下，CARoPE始终优于RoPE和其他常见的位置编码基线，实现了显著降低的困惑度。此外，CARoPE能够实现更快的训练吞吐量，而不会牺牲模型稳定性。

Conclusion: CARoPE提供了一种可扩展、富有表现力且高效的Transformer模型中现有位置编码策略的升级方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

TL;DR: SMART-Editor 是一种用于组合布局和内容编辑的框架，它使用奖励引导的规划来保持全局连贯性，并在多个领域优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型执行局部编辑，SMART-Editor 旨在解决这些模型的局限性，通过保持全局连贯性来实现组合布局和内容编辑。

Method: SMART-Editor 采用 Reward-Refine（一种推理时奖励引导的细化方法）和 RewardDPO（一种使用奖励对齐布局对的训练时偏好优化方法）两种策略。

Result: SMART-Editor 在 SMARTEdit-Bench 基准测试中优于 InstructPix2Pix 和 HIVE 等强大的基线模型，RewardDPO 在结构化设置中实现了高达 15% 的收益，Reward-Refine 在自然图像上显示出优势。

Conclusion: SMART-Editor 通过奖励引导的规划，在生成语义一致和视觉对齐的编辑方面具有价值。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的文本到 SQL 系统，该系统利用组件化的检索架构，无需微调即可在各种企业环境中使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的数据库自然语言接口取得了进展，但扩展到企业级数据目录仍然是一个尚未充分探索的挑战。先前解决这一挑战的著作依赖于特定领域的微调——使部署复杂化——并且未能利用数据库元数据中包含的重要语义上下文。

Method: 引入了一种基于组件的检索架构，该架构将数据库模式和元数据分解为离散的语义单元，每个单元都单独索引以进行有针对性的检索。该方法优先考虑有效的表识别，同时利用列级信息，确保检索到的表总数保持在可管理的上下文预算内。

Result: 该方法保持了较高的召回率和准确率，并且该系统在具有不同结构和可用元的海量数据库上优于基线。

Conclusion: 该解决方案无需专门的微调即可在各种企业环境中部署实用的文本到 SQL 系统，解决了自然语言数据库接口中的一个关键可扩展性缺口。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM在处理中文文本歧义时表现不佳，需要改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(llm)的可信度方面的一个关键研究问题:当llm遇到模糊的叙述文本时，它们会如何表现，特别关注中文文本的模糊性。

Method: 创建了一个基准数据集，通过收集和生成带有上下文的歧义句及其相应的消除歧义的配对，代表多种可能的解释。这些带注释的例子被系统地分为3个主要类别和9个子类别。

Result: 通过实验，我们发现在处理歧义时，llm存在显著的脆弱性，揭示了与人类行为有很大不同的行为。具体来说，llm不能可靠地区分歧义文本和非歧义文本，在将歧义文本解释为具有单一含义而不是多种含义时表现出过度自信，并且在试图理解各种可能的含义时表现出过度思考。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出与人类不同的行为，并且在处理歧义时存在明显的脆弱性。研究结果强调了当前LLM的一个基本局限性，这对它们在语言歧义普遍存在的实际应用中的部署具有重要意义，需要改进处理语言理解中不确定性的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub
repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

Motivation: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for multimodal models operating in real-world environments

Method: introducing ISO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between visual observations and procedural text

Result: the best zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1)

Conclusion: Evaluation results on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们研究了从用户-LM交互日志中获取用户反馈，发现用户反馈的内容可以提高模型在简短问题上的性能，但不能提高在较长和更复杂的问题上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接的用户反馈可能会造成干扰；因此，我们研究从用户-LM交互日志中获取用户反馈。

Method: 研究了两个用户-LM交互数据集（WildChat和LMSYS）中的隐式用户反馈

Result: 用户反馈的内容（例如，用户想要澄清）可以提高模型在简短的人工设计问题（MTBench）上的性能，但不能提高在较长和更复杂的问题（WildBench）上的性能。我们还发现，用户反馈的有用性在很大程度上与用户初始提示的质量有关。

Conclusion: 对隐式用户反馈进行了深入研究，展示了它的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS通过分析内部表征来学习估计模型置信度，从而优于传统的集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地结合多个LLM的预测对于增强系统鲁棒性和性能至关重要。然而，现有的集成方法通常依赖于简单的技术，如投票或logits集成，这忽略了模型在不同上下文中不同的置信度和可靠性。

Method: 提出LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from Neural States)，这是一种通过分析内部表征来学习估计模型置信度的新方法。对于每个LLM，我们训练一个轻量级的线性置信度预测器，该预测器利用逐层隐藏状态和标准化概率作为输入。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务上的实验结果表明，LENS的性能明显优于传统的集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表征为确定模型置信度提供了有价值的信号，并且可以有效地用于集成学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Motivation: 对 AI 生成的 GPU 内核的需求正在快速增长，这受到行业和学术界对可扩展的硬件优化解决方案的需求的影响。随着深度学习工作负载在复杂性和多样性方面不断增长，必须自动化底层内核开发，以满足性能和生产力需求。

Method: GEAK 框架利用最先进的 LLM 生成适用于 AMD GPU（包括 AMD MI300X 和 MI250）的高性能 Triton 代码，并利用推理时计算扩展来使用改编自 Reflexion 风格反馈机制的推理循环来生成基于 Triton 的 GPU 内核。

Conclusion: GEAK 代理代码生成在加速各种硬件平台的采用和普及专家级内核性能方面很有前景，在两个评估基准上，GEAK 显著优于直接提示前沿 LLM 以及基于 Reflexion 的生成管道，正确率高达 $63$%，执行速度提高了高达 $2.59$ 倍。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新颖的方法，该方法利用负样本来更好地选择正样本示例，从而提高少样本 ICL 的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出强大的少样本上下文学习 (ICL) 能力，但性能对提供的示例高度敏感。最近的研究主要集中在检索每个输入查询的相应示例，这不仅提高了学习过程的效率和可扩展性，而且减轻了手动示例选择中固有的偏差。然而，这些研究主要强调利用正样本，而忽略了负样本中用于上下文学习的额外信息。

Method: 利用负样本来更好地选择正样本例子，从而提高少样本 ICL 的性能。首先，我们基于 Zero-Shot-Cot 构建正样本和负样本语料库。然后，在推理过程中，我们采用基于语义相似度的方法，从正样本和负样本语料库中选择与给定查询最相似的例子。随后，我们基于与负样本的语义相似度，从正样本语料库中进一步检索正样本，然后将它们与先前选择的正样本连接起来，作为 ICL 演示。

Result: 我们的方法超过了仅依赖于最相似的正样本作为上下文的方法，验证了负样本中的额外信息有助于通过改进正样本选择来提高 ICL 性能。

Conclusion: 利用负样本来更好地选择正样本例子，从而提高少样本 ICL 的性能。实验结果表明，我们的方法超过了仅依赖于最相似的正样本作为上下文的方法，验证了负样本中的额外信息有助于通过改进正样本选择来提高 ICL 性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

Motivation: Traditional topic models struggle to capture semantically abstract features. Neural variants are similarly constrained by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate complex topics.

Method: Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs).

Result: MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Conclusion: Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs) can reveal deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers typically represented in a tabular format. Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data.

Method: The authors construct few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples and finetune TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN).

Conclusion: This paper introduces TAP-GPT, a novel framework that adapts TableGPT2 for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using structured biomarker data. It demonstrates that TAP-GPT outperforms other LLMs and a tabular foundation model in predicting AD from tabular data.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Result: Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to the other two LLMs.

Conclusion: Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning capabilities in the mental health domain. Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to GPT-4o mini, and Deepseek-chat.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to

Method: 对 8 个翻译数据集中 10 个最新的开源大型语言模型 (LLM) 进行了评估，并进行了全面的错误分析。

Result: 发现孟加拉语的表现与英语相比存在持续的性能差距，尤其是在较小的模型和特定的模型系列（如 Mistral）中。Tokenization 效率与 LLM 准确性之间存在反比关系。

Conclusion: 当前模型在孟加拉语上的表现不如英语，尤其是在较小模型和特定模型系列（如 Mistral）中。某些架构（如 DeepSeek）表现出良好的鲁棒性。Tokenization 效率与 LLM 准确性之间存在反比关系。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse

to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Identified and analyzed Super Experts (SEs) in MoE LLMs, showing their critical role in model performance, especially in mathematical reasoning, and their influence on attention sinks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts

Method: discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference

Result: pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance

Conclusion: MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

TL;DR: GPT-4o-mini implicitly moderates sensitive content, reducing derogatory and taboo language. The study also evaluates LLMs' zero-shot capabilities in classifying sentence sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions.

Method: This study empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.

Result: GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and taboo language.

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against traditional methods.

*Yiyan Ji,Haoran Chen,Qiguang Chen,Chengyue Wu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个新的多模态规划基准测试，揭示了现有模型在处理复杂约束时的不足，强调了在现实世界应用中提升约束感知推理能力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法直接评估多模态现实世界规划能力，并且缺乏跨模态的约束或隐式约束。

Method: 该论文提出了一个新的基准测试MPCC，用于评估多模态大型语言模型在规划中处理多模态约束的能力。MPCC包含三个现实世界的任务：航班规划、日历规划和会议规划，并引入了预算、时间、空间等复杂约束，以及难度等级划分。

Result: 实验结果表明，闭源模型的可行计划成功率仅为21.3%，开源模型平均低于11%。多模态大型语言模型对约束复杂性高度敏感，传统的提示策略在多重约束场景下失效。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，现有的多模态大型语言模型在处理具有复杂约束的现实世界规划任务时面临显著挑战，尤其是在约束感知推理方面需要进一步提升。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

### [57] [Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23386)
*Ailiang Lin,Zhuoyun Li,Kotaro Funakoshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal2Vec是一种通用嵌入模型，旨在增强decoder-only LLM的性能，而无需改变其原始架构或引入显著的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的许多方法主要侧重于移除LLM中的因果注意力掩码，以实现双向注意力，这可能会削弱模型在预训练期间获取语义信息的能力。此外，主要的单向方法通常依赖于额外的输入文本来克服因果注意力的固有局限性，这不可避免地增加了计算成本。

Method: 首先，使用轻量级的BERT风格模型将输入文本预编码为单个上下文token，然后将其添加到LLM的输入序列中，允许每个token捕获上下文信息，即使不关注未来的token。此外，为了减轻由last-token pooling引入的近因偏差，并帮助llm更好地利用上下文token中编码的语义信息，我们将上下文token和EOS token的最后隐藏状态连接起来作为最终的文本嵌入。

Result: Causal2Vec在MTEB上实现了最先进的性能，同时将所需的序列长度减少了高达85%，推理时间减少了高达82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在公开检索数据集上训练的模型中，在MTEB上实现了最先进的性能，同时与性能最佳的方法相比，所需序列长度减少了高达85%，推理时间减少了高达82%。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地重建城市规模的场景，并且在效率和质量上优于以前的方法。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

Conclusion: ScanDiff 在自由观看和任务驱动场景中超越了最先进的方法，生成了更多样化和准确的 scanpath，更好地捕捉了人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动了 gaze prediction 研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Motivation: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR) techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored.

Method: deep learning-based SR to improve classification accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs. Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images

Result: observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet, which also offers computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SR can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

TL;DR: NovaDrive, a vision-language architecture, improves autonomous vehicle navigation with higher success rates, path efficiency, and lower collision frequency. It uses a novel cross-attention mechanism and smoothness loss, fine-tuning a LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone for real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations.

Method: a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference.

Result: On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: NovaDrive raises success rate and boosts path-efficiency, and reduces collision frequency relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

TL;DR: Introduces MObI and AnydoorMed, two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, respectively, using diffusion models for realistic and controllable inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical applications require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing, but real-world data is costly and complex to gather. Synthetic data methods are promising but need high realism and controllability.

Method: two novel methods for synthetic data generation: MObI (Multimodal Object Inpainting) and AnydoorMed (reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans). MObI uses a diffusion model for realistic object insertion in autonomous driving scenes, guided by 3D bounding boxes. AnydoorMed extends this to medical imaging, using a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies in mammography scans with detail preservation.

Result: MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. AnydoorMed demonstrates impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue.

Conclusion: foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

TL;DR: Proposes a new state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation by combining existing concepts and refining them. Uses 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation and Alpha-CLIP with standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. Existing individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary.

Method: The solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. It employs robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, the standard CLIP model is replaced with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score is introduced to normalize text-to-proposal similarity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary method.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS

Motivation: identifies the root causes of the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges

Method: a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving video of a different individual. introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention rather than additive spatial guidance

Motivation: The problem of single-image rain streak removal requires the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches on Rain100L and Rain100H datasets.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的四模态框架显著优于三模态框架，证明了多模态运动检索在推进运动获取方面的潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in

imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

Result: AGD在攻击性能和模型对某些防御的鲁棒性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: AGD在攻击性能和模型对某些防御的鲁棒性方面优于最先进的方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Motivation: 食物晶体团聚是一种在结晶过程中发生的现象，它会在晶体之间截留水分，从而影响食品的质量。由于水结合的透明性和集中于成像样品单张切片的有限视角，在二维显微图像中手动注释团聚特别困难。

Conclusion: 该方法在两种置信度水平下评估，并成功分类了潜在的团聚实例。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) and an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy to address the challenge of distinguishing between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semi-FSCIL studies have a narrow perspective by assuming unlabeled data is only from novel classes.  GSemi-FSCIL is introduced to incorporate both base and all ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set, better reflecting real-world scenarios.

Method: Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy

Result: ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes.

Conclusion: The proposed ALDC method outperforms existing works on three benchmark datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）系统严重依赖有效的查询制定来解锁外部知识，但为不同的、非结构化的真实世界文档优化查询仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的查询重写框架RL-QR，该框架利用GRPO训练特定于检索器的查询重写器。

Result: 在工业内部数据上的实验表明，多模态RAG的NDCG@3相对增益为11%，词法检索器的增益为9%。

Conclusion: RL-QR在多模态和词法检索器上表现出显著的改进，但在语义和混合检索器上效果不佳，未来需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

TL;DR: Developed a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways, which achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping a comprehensive and detailed CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain.

Method: The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

Result: Quantitative and visual experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of pituitary adenoma patients.

Conclusion: The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TGSI, a novel evaluation metric for time series data, and SATL, a multi-component loss function to enhance structure modeling during training. Models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics.

Method: We propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss, a frequency domain loss, and a perceptual feature loss.

Result: Models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Conclusion: Models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm for multi-label image recognition with partial labels, which dynamically learns category-specific thresholds and improves performance, especially when labels are limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) often overlook the varying score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance.

Method: The paper introduces a Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm that calculates score distributions for positive and negative samples within each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these distributions. A differential ranking loss is implemented to enhance the discrimination of the thresholds. The distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated throughout the learning process.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels on large-scale multi-label datasets, such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200.

Conclusion: The proposed Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm significantly improves performance in multi-label image recognition with partial labels, especially in scenarios with limited labels, as demonstrated on large-scale datasets like Microsoft COCO and VG-200.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PixelNerd, a single-stage diffusion model using neural fields, which avoids the limitations of VAE-based approaches and achieves strong image generation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE). However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems, researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines and increased token complexity.

Method: The paper models patch-wise decoding with neural fields.

Result: PixelNerd achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. PixNerd-XXL/16 achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9 overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper introduces PixelNerd, a single-stage, efficient, end-to-end diffusion model using neural fields for patch-wise decoding, achieving competitive results on image generation and text-to-image tasks.

TL;DR: 研究了 Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) 是否可以适应乳房 MRI 中低成本、最小输入 3D 肿瘤分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳房 MRI 提供高分辨率体积成像，这对于肿瘤评估和治疗计划至关重要，但 3D 扫描的手动解读仍然 labor-intensive 和主观的。虽然人工智能驱动的工具在加速医学图像分析方面具有希望，但由于许可成本高、专有软件和基础设施需求，商业医学人工智能产品在低收入和中等收入国家的采用仍然有限。

Method: 使用一个切片上的单个边界框注释，我们使用三种不同的分片跟踪策略在 3D 体积中传播分割预测：自上而下、自下而上和由中心向外。

Result: 尽管是一个没有经过体积医学数据训练的 zero-shot 模型，但 SAM2 在最少的监督下实现了强大的分割性能。我们进一步分析了分割性能与肿瘤大小、位置和形状的关系，确定了关键的失败模式。我们发现由中心向外传播产生最一致和准确的分割。

Conclusion: SAM2 这样的通用基础模型可以在最少的监督下支持 3D 医学图像分析，为资源受限的环境提供了一种经济实惠的替代方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces iLRM, a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism. iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed on RE10K and DL3DV datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases.

Method: introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction.

Result: iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed.

Conclusion: iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger

TL;DR: UniLIP通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略扩展了CLIP的功能，使其在图像重建、生成和编辑任务中表现出色，超越了以往的统一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前基于CLIP的统一方法通常需要额外的扩散解码器或量化来支持重建和生成任务，导致不一致的重建或原始理解性能的下降。

Method: 我们引入了两阶段训练方案和自蒸馏策略，逐步将重建能力集成到CLIP中，使其在保持原有理解性能的同时，实现有效的图像重建。此外，我们提出了一种双条件架构来连接MLLM和扩散transformer，使用可学习的查询和最后一层多模态隐藏状态作为联合条件。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准测试中分别获得0.87和0.53的分数，超过了所有以前类似规模的统一模型。在图像编辑方面，UniLIP在ImgEdit基准测试中也获得了3.62的分数，超过了最近最先进的模型，如BAGEL和UniWorld-V1。

Conclusion: UniLIP有效地扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其连续的CLIP特征不仅可以作为理解任务的最佳选择，而且在生成和编辑任务中也能实现极具竞争力的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Motivation: The naive application of MLLMs introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query.

Method: Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood.

Result: BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average.

Conclusion: BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. CPN enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

Conclusion: LED effectively differentiates structural understanding capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible through traditional metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models

Motivation: Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations become large or structurally complex.

Method: a decoupled pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine.

Result: FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit precision, especially under demanding transformations on GeoBench benchmark.

Conclusion: FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity and edit precision, especially under demanding transformations.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using

GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a highly annotation-efficient and concise framework for Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) that overcomes the limitations of existing methods by using a self-training strategy and hybrid prompts to enhance a single-model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability.

Method: ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.

Result: ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods.

Conclusion: ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific

Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or

TL;DR: PriorFusion, a unified framework, integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception using instance-aware attention, shape template space, and a diffusion-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies in complex environments without high-definition map support. Existing approaches insufficiently exploit the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in irregular, inaccurate predictions.

Method: The paper proposes PriorFusion, a unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception. It introduces an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, and constructs a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. A diffusion-based framework leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions.

Result: Experiments on large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that the method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions, and produces more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在通过学习数十亿张图像（包括流行的艺术品）来生成艺术内容方面表现出了非凡的能力。然而，这些模型如何在内部表示概念（例如绘画中的内容和风格）这一根本问题仍未得到探索。传统的计算机视觉假设内容和风格是正交的，但扩散模型在训练过程中没有收到关于这种区分的明确指导。

Method: 利用交叉注意力热图将生成图像中的像素归因于特定的提示token，从而能够分离受内容描述token和风格描述token影响的图像区域。

Result: 扩散模型表现出不同程度的内容-风格分离，具体取决于特定的艺术提示和所要求的风格。在许多情况下，内容token主要影响与对象相关的区域，而风格token影响背景和纹理区域，这表明对内容-风格区分的初步理解。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在很大程度上表现出内容和风格的分离，内容token主要影响与对象相关的区域，而风格token影响背景和纹理区域，这表明对内容-风格差异的初步理解。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Motivation: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as embedded systems and edge devices.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,

real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA, a novel vision token pruning framework for autonomous driving, reduces computational costs by prioritizing foreground information. It outperforms existing methods on the nuScenes benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long visual tokens in VLA models increase computational costs, and current visual token pruning methods perform poorly in autonomous driving. Human drivers focus on foreground areas, so retaining visual tokens containing foreground information is essential.

Method: The paper proposes FastDriveVLA, a reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework with a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner. It uses MAE-style pixel reconstruction and an adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy. A new dataset, nuScenes-FG, is also introduced.

Result: FastDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed FastDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的车道线拓扑推理方法通常无法有效地利用时间信息来增强检测和推理性能；对历史查询的过度依赖，容易受到姿态估计失败的影响，并且时间传播不足。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的快-慢车道线分割拓扑推理框架，该框架通过潜在世界模型进行增强。

Result: FASTopoWM在OpenLane-V2基准测试中优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM在车道线分割检测(mAP 37.4% vs 33.6%)和中心线感知(OLS 46.3% vs 41.5%)方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的领域泛化框架，用于医学图像分割，该框架通过引入由领域统计数据引导的隐式特征扰动来提高对领域特定变化的鲁棒性，并在不同的临床领域实现了稳健和可泛化的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床工作流程中起着至关重要的作用，但是，当将模型应用于看不见的临床领域时，领域转移通常会导致性能下降。由于成像条件、扫描仪类型和采集协议的变化，导致了这一挑战，从而限制了分割模型的实际部署。与自然图像不同，医学图像通常在患者之间表现出一致的解剖结构，而领域特异性变化主要由成像条件引起。这种独特的特性使医学图像分割特别具有挑战性。

Method: 我们提出了一种为医学图像分割量身定制的领域泛化框架。我们的方法通过引入由领域统计数据引导的隐式特征扰动来提高对领域特定变化的鲁棒性。具体来说，我们采用可学习的语义方向选择器和基于协方差的语义强度采样器来调节领域变异特征，同时保持任务相关的解剖一致性。此外，我们设计了一种自适应一致性约束，该约束仅在特征调整导致分割性能下降时才选择性地应用。此约束鼓励调整后的特征与原始预测对齐，从而稳定特征选择并提高分割的可靠性。

Result: 我们的框架始终优于现有的领域泛化方法，在不同的临床领域实现了稳健和可泛化的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在两个公共多中心基准上进行的广泛实验表明，该框架始终优于现有的领域泛化方法，在不同的临床领域实现了稳健和可泛化的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Method: 结合开放词汇检测和跨模态学习的两阶段框架，包括NanoVerse YOLO模型和TSR-MCL模型。

Result: NanoVerse YOLO模型集成了RepVL-PAN和SPD-Conv模块，TSR-MCL模型通过对比视觉特征和语义特征，学习鲁棒的、频率独立的表示，有效缓解了数据不平衡导致的类别混淆。模型在TT100K数据集上实现了78.4% mAP，同时获得了91.8%的准确率和88.9%的召回率。

Conclusion: 该模型在TT100K数据集上实现了最先进的78.4% mAP，并在复杂场景中表现出卓越的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Method: The paper analyzes key design patterns in computer vision by examining six influential papers, starting with foundational architectures and progressing to generative and self-supervised learning techniques.

Result: The paper reviews ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), DINO, and Masked Autoencoders (MAE), highlighting their contributions and advancements in image recognition, generation, and self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: This paper concludes by exploring self-supervised learning techniques like DINO and MAE to reduce dependency on labeled data, enhancing scalability and effectiveness in pre-training large-scale vision models.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs are too large. NLP pruning methods don't work well on them. Short-LVLM solves this by utilizing important VL tokens and mitigating the layer-wise feature gaps, achieving a better performance/efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications of LVLMs are limited by massive model parameters and high computational costs. Directly applying NLP layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective due to modality divergence between vision and language.

Method: A novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps.

Result: Directly applying NLP layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs.

Conclusion: Short-LVLM achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency. It is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are

*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一的情感理解和生成框架，通过联合训练和双重反馈过程，在两个任务上都取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感理解和生成通常被视为独立的任务，但它们本质上是互补的，并且可以相互促进。

Method: 提出了一个统一的框架UniEmo，集成了情感理解和生成任务。该框架利用分层情感理解链提取多尺度情感特征，并融合专家查询和情感表征来指导扩散模型生成图像。引入情感相关系数和情感条件损失来提高生成图像的多样性和保真度。提出了数据过滤算法来选择高质量和多样化的情感图像，并反馈到理解部分。

Result: UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式对齐策略MP^2A，以提高CLIP在无监督域适应中的性能，通过在可靠数据上训练，逐步加入更具挑战性的样本，从而减轻确认偏差并促进更稳健的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法试图同时使用所有伪标记数据来对齐源域和目标域，这种一次性对齐难以处理噪声样本，导致误差传播和次优特征学习。多源场景中，不同的域间差距和不同噪声水平会进一步破坏对齐过程。

Method: 提出了一种渐进式对齐策略，用于将CLIP适应到无标签的下游任务。

Result: MP^2A实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MP^2A在三个流行的UDA基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: NeRF-GS 结合了 NeRF 和 3DGS 的优点，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用 NeRF 固有的连续空间表示来缓解 3DGS 的一些局限性，包括对高斯初始化敏感、空间感知有限以及高斯间相关性较弱，从而提高其性能。

Method: 共同优化神经辐射场 (NeRF) 和 3D 高斯 Splatting (3DGS)。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，NeRF-GS 超过了现有方法，并取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NeRF 和 3DGS 是互补的，而不是竞争关系，为结合 3DGS 和 NeRF 以实现高效 3D 场景表示的混合方法提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

### [110] [AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402)
*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自适应分组对齐框架（AGA），用于从配对的医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义，并在图像-文本检索和分类任务中取得了强大的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学领域视觉-语言预训练方法通常将临床报告简化为单个实体或碎片化的token，忽略了它们固有的结构。此外，对比学习框架通常依赖于大量的难负样本，这对于小规模医学数据集是不切实际的。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架，即自适应分组对齐（AGA），该框架从配对的医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义。AGA引入了一种基于稀疏相似度矩阵的双向分组机制。为实现自适应分组，我们设计了两个阈值门控模块，分别称为语言分组阈值门和视觉分组阈值门，它们可以动态学习分组阈值。组表示被计算为基于相似度分数的加权平均值。为了使每个token与其组表示对齐，我们引入了一种实例感知组对齐损失，该损失在每个图像-文本对中运行，从而无需外部负例。最后，应用双向跨模态分组对齐模块来增强视觉和语言组表示之间的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在公共和私有数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们的方法在微调和零样本设置下的图像-文本检索和分类任务中都取得了强大的性能。

Conclusion: AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，无论是在微调还是零样本设置下。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建的OOD检测方法，该方法利用基于Stein score的去噪扩散模型(SBDDM)的正向扩散轨迹，实现了state-of-the-art的性能，并大大降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法通常依赖于似然估计或重建误差，但这些方法计算成本高昂、不可靠，并且如果内部数据发生变化，则需要重新训练。这些限制阻碍了它们有效、一致和稳健地区分标称输入和异常输入的能力。

Method: 利用基于Stein score的去噪扩散模型(SBDDM)的正向扩散轨迹来捕获轨迹曲率，从而实现精确的异常评分，仅需五个扩散步骤。

Result: SBDDM在近OOD和远OOD检测方面分别实现了高达10.43%和18.10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 基于Stein score的去噪扩散模型(SBDDM)在近OOD和远OOD检测中取得了state-of-the-art的性能，并且大大降低了推理过程中的计算成本，为实时可靠的计算机辅助诊断提供了一个实用的基础模块。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该系统能够以 96.39% 的交叉验证准确率检测蜂蜜中的掺假行为，使其成为当前化学检测方法的合适替代品。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 中推理与偏见之间的权衡，发现使用强化学习训练的特定比例的混合样本可以在保持推理准确率的同时有效减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 已经在广泛的任务和模态中取得了最先进的结果。为了进一步提高他们的推理能力，最近的研究探索了先进的提示方案和后训练微调。虽然这些技术提高了逻辑准确性，但它们经常使模型的输出带有明显的社会偏见。因此，阐明推理收益如何与偏见缓解相互作用，以及这两个目标是否固有地相互权衡，仍然是一个开放且紧迫的研究问题。

Method: 对三种偏见缓解策略（监督微调 (SFT)、知识蒸馏 (KD) 和基于规则的强化学习 (RL)）在相同条件下进行基准测试，建立它们的基本优势和劣势。在此基础上，改变每个范例中以消除偏见为重点和以推理为中心的样本的比例，以绘制推理与偏见之间的权衡。

Result: 揭示了一个一致的最佳点：使用强化学习训练的约 1:4 的混合比例可以在保持模型原始推理准确率的 88% 的同时，将刻板印象分数降低 10%，为平衡 MLLM 中的公平性和能力提供了具体的指导。

Conclusion: 发现了一个平衡点：使用强化学习训练的约 1:4 的混合比例可以在保持模型原始推理准确率的 88% 的同时，将刻板印象分数降低 10%，为平衡 MLLM 中的公平性和能力提供了具体的指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

Motivation: 当前的人工智能系统在人类轻松执行的听觉任务上 катастрофически 失败。

Method: 引入了一个包含七个类别（重叠语音、噪声中的语音、时间扭曲、空间音频、咖啡店噪声、电话失真和感知错觉）的 917 项挑战的听觉图灵测试。

Result: 对包括 GPT-4 的音频功能和 OpenAI 的 Whisper 在内的最先进音频模型的评估显示，失败率超过 93%，即使是性能最好的模型在人类以 7.5 倍的成功率（52%）解决的任务中也只达到 6.9% 的准确率。

Conclusion: 当前人工智能系统在听觉任务上表现不佳，暴露出在选择性注意、噪声鲁棒性和情境适应方面的缺陷。需要将选择性注意、基于物理的音频理解和上下文感知整合到多模态人工智能系统中。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

Conclusion: 过滤掉不连贯的预测可以提高预测准确率，这支持了连贯性在人类和基于 LLM 的预测中的实际价值。用户通常不符合这种连贯性属性，因此需要在基于论证的判断预测中整合机制，以在获得群体预测之前过滤掉不连贯的意见。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

Motivation: 量化查询答案解释的定量方法使用责任度量来为事实分配分数，以量化它们对获得给定答案的各自贡献。本文研究了在本体介导的查询回答中计算这种责任分数的复杂性。

Method: 研究了基于 Shapley 值的责任度量，并利用数据库设置中的结果来分析其复杂性。通过对结构受限的合取查询进行细致分析，识别出可有效计算 WSMS 的类别。

Result: 对于一阶可重写的本体介导的查询类别，这些度量具有多项式数据复杂性；当本体语言可以编码可达性查询时，问题变成“shP”-hard。如果本体语言支持合取，则即使在没有本体的情况下，原子查询和“表现良好”的合取查询的并集也存在难处理性。对于常见的 DL-Lite 方言，识别出结构受限的合取查询类别，允许进行易于处理的 WSMS 计算。

Conclusion: 对于本体介导的查询回答，计算基于 Shapley 值的责任度量的复杂性问题，并确定了在哪些条件下可以有效地计算这些度量。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ReLU评分方法（SAS），结合Hybrid MILP，提高了验证效率和准确性，显著减少了未确定实例的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了处理复杂实例，重新审视分而治之的方法来分解复杂性：不依赖于少数复杂的BaB调用，而是依赖于许多小的partial MILP调用。关键步骤是选择非常少但非常重要的ReLU，使用（昂贵的）二元变量来处理。

Method: 提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分（SAS），并调整BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局ReLU评分（GS）函数。

Result: SAS在选择一组使用二元变量打开的变量时效率更高。与之前的尝试相比，SAS将二元变量的数量减少了约6倍，同时保持了相同的精度。与之前的尝试相比，在保持相同水平精度的前提下，SAS将二元变量的数量减少了大约 6 倍。未确定实例的数量减少了高达 40%，降至较低水平（8-15%），同时保持了合理的运行时间（每个实例平均 46 秒-417 秒）。

Conclusion: Hybrid MILP结合$\alpha,\beta$-CROWN和partial MILP，能有效减少未确定实例的数量，同时保持合理的运行时间。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Self-Foveate, a novel LLM-driven method for instruction synthesis that enhances the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for

address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora

our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Motivation: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.

Result: reasoning-first architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches, yielding nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 因果解释既具有形式严谨性，又具有与基于逻辑的解释相同的形式属性，同时仍然适用于黑盒算法，并且自然适合图像分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像分类器输出解释算法基于多种方法，产生的解释缺乏形式严谨性。另一方面，基于逻辑的解释在形式上是严格定义的，但它们的可计算性依赖于对模型的严格假设，而这些假设并不适用于图像分类器。

Method: 因果解释

Result: 证明了因果解释的形式属性，并介绍了图像分类器的对比因果解释。此外，我们使用置信度感知来增强解释的定义，并引入完整的因果解释：以与原始图像完全相同的置信度进行分类的解释。

Conclusion: 不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性方面具有不同的模式。这些算法是高效可计算的，在 ResNet50 模型上平均每张图像花费 6 秒来计算所有类型的解释，并且是完全黑盒的，不需要了解模型，不需要访问模型内部，不需要访问梯度，也不需要模型的任何属性，例如单调性。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance. Existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps.

Method: DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, and proposes a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.

Result: DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: DICE is effective and general, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Motivation: 在协作系统中，任务的有效完成取决于对潜在设备进行特定于任务的信任评估以进行分布式协作。然而，任务的复杂性、分布式设备资源的时空动态性以及不可避免的评估开销，都极大地增加了信任评估过程的复杂性和资源消耗。因此，不合时宜或过于频繁的信任评估会降低受限资源的利用率，从而对协作任务的执行产生负面影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法实现了资源高效的信任评估。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了资源高效的信任评估。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MemoCue, a strategy-guided agent that enhances memory recall by transforming queries into cue-rich prompts, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited size of memory modules in conventional agent-assisted memory recall methods hinders the acquisition of complete memories. Memory theories suggest that proactive activation of relevant memory through effective cues can improve recall.

Method: a Recall Router framework with a 5W Recall Map to classify memory queries and a hierarchical recall tree with Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize strategy selection and response generation. Instruction tuning is used to fine-tune LLMs to develop MemoCue.

Result: MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration.

Conclusion: MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in memory-recall applications.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

TL;DR: Proposes Seed-Prover, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model, and Seed-Geometry, a geometry reasoning engine, achieving state-of-the-art results in mathematical reasoning and proving 5/6 IMO 2025 problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning.

Method: a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.

Result: Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine Seed-Geometry, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了生成高质量的LLM训练数据。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 让LLM先进行推理和规划，然后生成新的合成提示，并通过自动指标过滤高质量数据。

Result: 在MATH500, AMC23, AIME24和GPQA-Diamond等可验证推理任务以及AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard等非验证指令跟随任务上，CoT-Self-Instruct方法表现出色。

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct方法在可验证推理和非验证指令跟随任务上，显著优于现有训练数据集或人工提示。

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimuRA：一种用于通用智能体推理的面向目标的架构，它使用LLM进行模拟规划，并在网页浏览任务中表现出改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大型语言模型（LLM）构建的AI智能体具有巨大的前景，但目前的实践侧重于一个任务一个智能体的方法，这不仅无法扩展和通用，而且还受到自回归LLM的根本限制。另一方面，人类是通用的智能体，他们通过在精神上模拟他们的行为和计划的结果来进行推理。为了构建一个更通用和强大的AI智能体，我们引入了SimuRA，一个面向目标的通用智能体推理架构。

Method: 基于对任何环境中最佳智能体的原则性公式，通过引入用于模拟规划的世界模型，克服了自回归推理的局限性。通用世界模型使用LLM实现，LLM可以使用自然语言的概念丰富的潜在空间在广泛的环境中灵活地进行规划。

Result: 在困难的网页浏览任务上的实验表明，\[模型名称]将航班搜索的成功率从0％提高到32.2％。特别是，基于世界模型的规划显示出比自回归规划高达124％的一致优势，证明了世界模型模拟作为一种推理范例的优势。

Conclusion: 我们对基于LLM的单一通用智能体模型在所有环境中都能超智能地行动的可能性感到兴奋。我们提供SimuRA，一个基于\[模型名称]和预训练LLM的网页浏览智能体，作为一个研究演示供公众测试。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

*Taiyi Wang,Eiko Yoneki*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AutoIndexer通过结合工作负载压缩、查询优化和专用RL模型，有效扩展索引选择，从而显著降低了搜索复杂性，同时没有牺牲太多的索引质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对于处理大规模分析工作负载的系统，高效选择索引对于数据库性能优化至关重要。深度强化学习(DRL)通过其从经验中学习的能力，在自动化索引选择方面显示出了希望，但由于指数增长的行动空间和大量的试验和错误，很少有工作涉及这些基于rl的索引顾问如何适应扩展的工作负载。

Method: AutoIndexer结合了工作负载压缩、查询优化和专用RL模型来有效扩展索引选择。

Result: 与非索引基线相比，它可以减少高达95%的端到端查询执行时间。平均而言，在工作负载成本节约方面，它比最先进的基于rl的索引顾问高出约20%，同时将调优时间缩短了50%以上。

Conclusion: AutoIndexer在大型和多样化工作负载中具有实用性。

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

*Piotr Sowinski,Kacper Grzymkowski,Anastasiya Danilenka*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Jelly-Patch是一种用于RDF数据集更改的高性能压缩二进制序列化格式，可提高吞吐量和压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型和低延迟RDF应用中，大量和频繁的更新会导致更改的序列化和传输中的性能瓶颈。记录RDF系统中的数据更改是一项关键功能，需要支持审计、增量备份、数据库复制和事件驱动的工作流。

Method: 我们提出了Jelly-Patch——一种用于RDF数据集更改的高性能压缩二进制序列化格式。

Result: Jelly-Patch的压缩率提高了3.5--8.9倍，序列化和解析的吞吐量分别提高了2.5倍和4.6倍。

Conclusion: Jelly-Patch显著提高了吞吐量和压缩率，有望改善大规模和低延迟RDF系统的性能。

Abstract: Recording data changes in RDF systems is a crucial capability, needed to
support auditing, incremental backups, database replication, and event-driven
workflows. In large-scale and low-latency RDF applications, the high volume and
frequency of updates can cause performance bottlenecks in the serialization and
transmission of changes. To alleviate this, we propose Jelly-Patch -- a
high-performance, compressed binary serialization format for changes in RDF
datasets. To evaluate its performance, we benchmark Jelly-Patch against
existing RDF Patch formats, using two datasets representing different use cases
(change data capture and IoT streams). Jelly-Patch is shown to achieve
3.5--8.9x better compression, and up to 2.5x and 4.6x higher throughput in
serialization and parsing, respectively. These significant advancements in
throughput and compression are expected to improve the performance of
large-scale and low-latency RDF systems.

TL;DR: DataLens is a web platform combining faceted search and visualizations for better resource discovery. User study validates the value of network-based exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging repositories lack advanced search and exploration features. Most search methods rely on keyword queries and metadata filtering, which require prior knowledge and fail to reveal connections between resources.

Method: a web-based platform that combines faceted search with advanced visualization techniques

Result: DataLens enhances resource discovery through network-based visualizations and a chained views approach.

Conclusion: A formative user study with six data practitioners showed that users highly value visualization tools, especially network-based exploration, and provided insights for refining our approach to better support dataset search.

Abstract: The rapid growth of publicly available textual resources, such as lexicons
and domain-specific corpora, presents challenges in efficiently identifying
relevant resources. While repositories are emerging, they often lack advanced
search and exploration features. Most search methods rely on keyword queries
and metadata filtering, which require prior knowledge and fail to reveal
connections between resources. To address this, we present DataLens, a
web-based platform that combines faceted search with advanced visualization
techniques to enhance resource discovery. DataLens offers network-based
visualizations, where the network structure can be adapted to suit the specific
analysis task. It also supports a chained views approach, enabling users to
explore data from multiple perspectives. A formative user study involving six
data practitioners revealed that users highly value visualization
tools-especially network-based exploration-and offered insights to help refine
our approach to better support dataset search.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LiDu的方法来量化推荐模型的不确定性，从而实现自我评估，实验表明LiDu与推荐性能高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文通过量化推荐模型的不确定性来研究推荐模型的自我感知能力，这提供了对其性能的无标签估计。这种自我评估可以在推荐器与任何用户交互之前实现更明智的理解和决策。

Method: 提出了一种直观有效的方法，即基于概率的列表分布不确定性（LiDu）。LiDu通过确定推荐器基于各个项目的预测分布生成特定排名列表的概率来衡量不确定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，与一系列无标签性能估计器相比，LiDu与推荐性能的相关性更高。此外，LiDu还提供了对模型在整个训练和推理过程中的动态内部状态的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 建立了推荐不确定性和性能之间的经验联系，并将其构建为迈向更透明和自我评估的推荐系统的一步。

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

*Wei-Wei Du,Takuma Udagawa,Kei Tateno*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IntervalLLM integrates interval information into LLM for sequential recommendation, achieving improvements in warm and cold scenarios. Interval-based cold challenges need further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook dynamic intervals between items, which serve as a dimension that describes user profiling.

Method: Integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel interval-infused attention.

Result: IntervalLLM achieves 4.4% improvements in average and the best-performing warm and cold scenarios. The cold scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant performance drop.

Conclusion: IntervalLLM achieves 4.4% improvements and best-performing warm and cold scenarios. Interval perspective experiences the most significant performance drop.

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

TL;DR: This paper introduces nuFormer, a transformer-based representation learning model for transaction data that improves large-scale recommendation problems by enhancing representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging user data effectively remains challenging due to its complexity and scale. Thus, in many financial institutions, most production models follow traditional machine learning (ML) approaches by converting unstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Conversely, other domains (e.g., natural language processing) have effectively utilized self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn rich representations from raw data, removing the need for manual feature extraction.

Method: A new method enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting transformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. The approach, denoted nuFormer, includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that integrates user embeddings with existing tabular features.

Result: Transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data can provide a novel and powerful approach to understanding customer behavior.

Conclusion: The experiments demonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank. Notably, these gains are achieved solely through enhanced representation learning rather than incorporating new data sources.

Abstract: Predictive models play a crucial role in the financial industry, enabling
risk prediction, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations, where
slight changes in core model performance can result in billions of dollars in
revenue or losses. While financial institutions have access to enormous amounts
of user data (e.g., bank transactions, in-app events, and customer support
logs), leveraging this data effectively remains challenging due to its
complexity and scale. Thus, in many financial institutions, most production
models follow traditional machine learning (ML) approaches by converting
unstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Conversely, other
domains (e.g., natural language processing) have effectively utilized
self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn rich representations from raw data,
removing the need for manual feature extraction. In this paper, we investigate
using transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data,
hypothesizing that these models, trained on massive data, can provide a novel
and powerful approach to understanding customer behavior. We propose a new
method enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting
transformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. Our
approach, denoted nuFormer, includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that
integrates user embeddings with existing tabular features. Our experiments
demonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank.
Notably, these gains are achieved solely through enhanced representation

Motivation: summarize large volumes of unstructured text

Method: evaluate topic models from a database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs

Result: identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters

Conclusion: optimize model parameters and responsible use of topic models

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for
their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised
machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help
general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they
risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an
accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a
database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal
is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what
these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

Result: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 可用于支持基于自然语言交互的范围界定过程的产品线范围界定任务。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了如何应用大型语言模型（LLM）来支持产品线范围界定任务，并讨论了将LLM与产品线范围界定相结合的开放研究挑战。

Abstract: The idea of product line scoping is to identify the set of features and
configurations that a product line should include, i.e., offer for
configuration purposes. In this context, a major scoping task is to find a
balance between commercial relevance and technical feasibility. Traditional
product line scoping approaches rely on formal feature models and require a
manual analysis which can be quite time-consuming. In this paper, we sketch how
Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to support product line scoping
tasks with a natural language interaction based scoping process. Using a
working example from the smarthome domain, we sketch how LLMs can be applied to
evaluate different feature model alternatives. We discuss open research
challenges regarding the integration of LLMs with product line scoping.

TL;DR: 本文提出了个性化着陆页建模 (PLPM) 任务，并提出了一个名为 KLAN 的分层解决方案框架，该框架在快手平台上进行了在线实验，结果表明 KLAN 在 DAU 和用户生命周期方面有所改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数研究都集中在改进第二阶段用户反馈的顺序推荐任务上，而对如何在第一阶段实现更好的页面导航的研究很少。为了填补这一空白，我们将个性化着陆页建模 (PLPM) 的任务正式定义到推荐系统领域中。

Method: 我们提出了 KLAN（快手着陆页自适应导航器），这是一个分层解决方案框架，旨在在 PLPM 的公式下提供个性化的着陆页。KLAN 包含三个关键组件：(1) KLAN-ISP 捕获日间静态页面偏好；(2) KLAN-IIT 捕获日内动态兴趣转移；(3) KLAN-AM 自适应地集成这两个组件以实现最佳导航决策。

Result: KLAN在每日活跃用户 (DAU) 和用户生命周期 (LT) 方面分别获得了 +0.205% 和 +0.192% 的改进。

Conclusion: KLAN在快手平台上的大量在线实验表明了其有效性，在每日活跃用户 (DAU) 和用户生命周期 (LT) 方面分别获得了 +0.205% 和 +0.192% 的改进。我们的 KLAN 最终以全流量部署在在线平台上，为数亿用户提供服务。为了促进对这一重要领域的进一步研究，我们将在论文被接受后发布我们的数据集和代码。

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAR 是一种基于生成自回归变换器的新型大脑衰老模拟模型，它以高保真度对特定于受试者的大脑衰老轨迹进行建模，优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大脑衰老合成是一项关键任务，在临床和计算神经科学中具有广泛的应用。从早期 MRI 扫描预测受试者大脑的未来结构演变的能力，为衰老轨迹提供了宝贵的见解。然而，数据的高维度、跨年龄的结构细微变化以及受试者特异性模式构成了衰老大脑合成的挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于生成自回归变换器的新型大脑衰老模拟模型 NeuroAR。NeuroAR 通过自回归方式估计先前扫描和未来扫描的串联令牌嵌入的便利空间中的未来扫描的离散令牌图来合成衰老的大脑。

Result: 我们在老年人群和青少年受试者中评估了我们的方法，在图像保真度方面，证明了其优于最先进的生成模型，包括潜在扩散模型 (LDM) 和生成对抗网络。此外，我们采用预先训练的年龄预测器来进一步验证合成图像在预期衰老模式方面的一致性和真实性。

Conclusion: NeuroAR显著优于关键模型，包括LDM，证明了其能够以高保真度对特定于受试者的大脑衰老轨迹进行建模。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Motivation: 多层感知器 (MLP) 的局限性，包括较差的可解释性、固定的激活函数以及难以捕获局部或高频特征，推动了从MLP到Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 的转变。

Method: 通过架构设计、训练策略、应用效果以及与基于MLP的对应物的比较评估，对每个角度进行检查。

Conclusion: 本文总结了基于KAN的模型在数据驱动学习、物理信息建模和深度算子学习三个不同角度的最新进展，并确定了KAN开发中的关键挑战和开放的研究问题。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture using deep learning and XAI, achieving strong predictive accuracy and detailed temporal explanations of climate impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate extremes pose increasing risks to agriculture, necessitating reliable multi-hazard early warning systems that can learn from recent climate behaviors. Traditional methods fail to capture complex interactions among concurrent climatic events.

Method: The paper combines sequential deep learning models and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard forecasting framework.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and provides comprehensive temporal explanations of influential climatic features and their impacts.

Conclusion: This research advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard early warning systems, fostering trust and effective decision-making for climate risk management in agriculture.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Result: FedCVD++ 实现了最先进的结果：联邦 XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) 超过了其中心化对应模型 (F1 = 0.78)，联邦随机森林 (F1 = 0.81) 与非联邦性能相匹配。此外，我们的通信效率策略将带宽消耗降低了 3.2 倍，同时保持了 95% 的准确率。

Conclusion: FedCVD++在保护隐私的同时，实现了最先进的冠心病风险预测，并在多机构部署中表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI 是一种多模态深度学习框架，可预测城市热应力，速度更快、精度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于气候变化和城市化，极端高温事件日益加剧，城市在缓解室外热应力方面面临越来越多的挑战。虽然传统的物理模型（如 SOLWEIG 和 ENVI-met）可以对人体感知到的热暴露进行详细评估，但它们的计算需求限制了城市范围规划的可扩展性。

Method: 我们提出了 GSM-UTCI，这是一个多模态深度学习框架，旨在以 1 米的超局部分辨率预测白天平均通用热气候指数 (UTCI)。

Result: GSM-UTCI 实现了接近物理的精度，R2 为 0.9151，平均绝对误差 (MAE) 为 0.41{\deg}C，同时将整个城市的推理时间从数小时缩短到五分钟以内。不透水表面到树木的转换产生了最高的综合效益（270.7 平方公里范围内 UTCI 的平均变化为 -4.18{\deg}C）。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI 是一种可扩展的、细粒度的决策支持工具，适用于城市气候适应，能够对不同城市环境中的绿化策略进行基于情景的评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估人类认知和心理特征的标准测试中取得了显著成果，但这些结果通常被误解为人工智能具有类似人类的特征。

Method: 通过论证和分析，强调了当前使用人类心理和教育测试评估人工智能的局限性。

Result: 论证了将基准测试性能解释为衡量类似人类的特征缺乏足够的理论和实证依据。

Conclusion: 停止使用人类测试评估人工智能，而是开发有原则的、特定于人工智能的测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

TL;DR: 多模态潜在空间虽然擅长前向任务，但在反向映射方面存在局限性，需要进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务特定 AI 模型中多模态潜在空间的反向能力和更广泛的效用。虽然这些模型擅长其设计的前向任务（例如，文本到图像生成，音频到文本转录），但它们在逆向映射方面的潜力在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 提出了一种基于优化的框架，用于从期望的输出中推断输入特征，并将其双向应用于文本-图像和文本-音频模态。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然优化可以迫使模型产生在文本上与目标对齐的输出，但这些反演的感知质量是混乱和不连贯的。此外，当尝试从生成模型推断原始语义输入时，重构的潜在空间嵌入通常缺乏语义可解释性，与无意义的词汇标记对齐。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间主要针对特定前向任务进行优化，不具备稳健和可解释逆映射所需的结构。需要进一步研究开发真正具有语义丰富性和可逆性的多模态潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weight and activation quantization (WAQ) designs for large language model (LLM) inference face challenges due to accuracy degradation at low precision with uniform quantization and runtime overhead with online outlier detection.

Method: proposes KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework featuring an index-based computation scheme and a novel outlier detection engine called Orizuru.

Result: KLLM achieves significant speedups and energy efficiency improvements compared to A100 GPU and Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x and 7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x and 150.21x compared to the A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Motivation: Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from individual actor behavior.

Result: identifying a small but consistently influential set of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time.

Conclusion: Actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in critically ill patients is challenging.

Method: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria (creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior sampling.

Result: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation. CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800, specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII.

Conclusion: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely interventions in critical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space

Method: a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings

Result: The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML

Conclusion: fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows

Motivation: no study on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the device and model selection to meet the demands of applications

Method: rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional, neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices

Conclusion: Hardware and framework optimization, along with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

*Richard Williams,Eric Nalisnick,Andrew Holbrook*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiGG-E, an autoregressive model, learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs, captures distributions, is scalable, and is computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge.

Method: an autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting sparsity

Result: Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: BiGG-E captures distributions over weighted graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

*David J Goetze,Dahlia J Felten,Jeannie R Albrecht,Rohit Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLOSS mitigates the impacts of missing data on federated learning in the presence of stragglers and user opt-out


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and degrades model performance.

Method: a system

Result: empirically demonstrate its performance in simulations.

Conclusion: FLOSS mitigates the impacts of missing data on federated learning.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates the impact of noise on the robustness and generalization of spoken keyword classifiers, finding that noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has shown correlations between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies in computer vision, but such relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. The study investigates how training conditions and input features affect the robustness and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD conditions.

Method: Benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of evaluation sets and quantify the impact of noise on generalization using Fairness (F) and Robustness (R) metrics.

Result: Noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations.

Conclusion: Noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations, which sheds new light on the benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in speech models.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

TL;DR: This paper studies the arbitrariness in probabilistic classification tasks and introduces a measure of regret to evaluate the predictions of a model could change as a result of different training labels change. Estimating regret can promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper studies how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification tasks as a result of an effect that we call observational multiplicity, which can undermine interpretability and safety when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals.

Method: The paper proposes to evaluate the arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of regret. A general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification task is presented.

Result: The paper uses the measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a measure of regret for probabilistic classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could change as a result of different training labels change. The paper demonstrates how estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and data collection.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的AI框架，用于解决微分方程，该框架利用第一性原理数据生成方法和尺度扩张算子（SDO）AI求解器来提高精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多问题都受微分方程（DE）支配。人工智能（AI）是解决DE问题的一条新途径。然而，数据非常稀缺，现有的AI求解器在逼近高频分量（AHFC）方面存在困难。

Method: 该方法包括DE统治的第一性原理数据生成方法和尺度扩张算子（SDO）AI求解器。利用先验知识或随机场，我们生成解决方案，然后将它们代入DE中，通过平衡DE来推导源和初始/边界条件，从而以极低的计算成本产生大量的、与第一性原理相一致的训练数据集。我们引入了一个可逆的SDO，它利用多尺度解的傅里叶变换来修正AHFC，并设计了一个具有SDO的时空耦合的、基于注意力的Transformer AI DE求解器。

Result: 在损失函数的Hessian条件数的上限被证明与解梯度平方2-范数成正比，表明SDO产生了一个更平滑的损失面，因此通过有效的训练修正了AHFC。在不同的DE上的广泛测试表明，我们的AI范例比最先进的方法实现了始终优越的精度。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一种新的AI范例来解决各种微分方程，并在不同的微分方程上进行了广泛的测试，结果表明，与目前最好的方法相比，该AI范例取得了一致的卓越精度。这项工作使微分方程的AI求解器在广泛的自然和工程领域中真正可用。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuseTen, a novel generative framework, generates daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. It outperforms linear baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST).

Method: FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. It employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.

Result: FuseTen produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution.

Conclusion: FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. This is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

Abstract: When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties:

our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

### [166] [NaN-Propagation: A Novel Method for Sparsity Detection in Black-Box Computational Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23186)
*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过利用 NaN 传播来检测黑盒函数中的稀疏性，从而在基于梯度的优化中实现计算加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒函数中的稀疏性检测可以通过雅可比矩阵压缩显着加快基于梯度的优化中的计算速度，但现有的有限差分方法由于偶然的零梯度而存在误报。这些误报会悄无声息地破坏梯度计算，从而导致难以诊断的错误。

Method: 引入 NaN 传播，它利用 IEEE 754 Not-a-Number 浮点值的通用污染特性，通过浮点数值计算来跟踪输入-输出依赖关系。通过系统地用 NaN 污染输入并观察哪些输出变为 NaN，该方法重建了消除误报的保守稀疏模式。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型上演示了该方法，实现了 1.52 倍的加速，同时检测到传统方法遗漏的数十个依赖关系——这是一项显着改进，因为梯度计算是许多优化工作流程中的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该技术利用 IEEE 754 合规性，可在不修改现有黑盒代码的情况下跨编程语言和数学库工作。包括 NaN 有效负载编码在内的高级策略实现了快于线性的时间复杂度，优于现有的黑盒稀疏性检测方法。还提出了实用的算法来缓解工程应用中常见的来自分支代码执行的挑战。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Result: DocsRay 将查询延迟从 3.89 秒降低到 2.12 秒，效率提高了 45%。

Conclusion: DocsRay-Pro 在 MMLongBench-Doc 基准测试中达到了 64.7% 的准确率，大大超过了之前的最先进水平。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Result: 该探测器分离出一个单一的、可转移的线性方向，将幻觉文本与忠实文本区分开来，性能优于基线5-27个点，并在Gemma-2模型（2B到27B）中表现出稳健的中间层性能。

Conclusion: 内部的、低维的幻觉跟踪与特定的MLP子电路相关联，可用于检测和缓解。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

Conclusion: IAU算法在删除保证、卸载效率和模型效用之间实现了卓越的平衡，同时在各种数据集和模型架构上优于最先进的方法。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed

we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning

thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model

Conclusion: SequenceLayers enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs, and can be implemented in any deep learning library, streamlining the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers

TL;DR: This paper introduces the forgotten item prediction task and proposes interpretable algorithms that outperform existing methods in identifying forgotten items during supermarket visits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying forgotten items and explaining recommendations is underexplored in Next Basket Prediction (NBP). Existing NBP approaches don't detect unintentionally omitted items due to data scarcity and reliance on black-box models.

Method: Two novel interpretable-by-design algorithms are proposed to identify forgotten items.

Result: Algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP baselines by 10-15%.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP baselines by 10-15% on a real-world retail dataset.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种通过在思想层面操作的内在信号来判断逐步正确性的方法，并将连续的正确/不正确的步骤聚合为连贯的“思想”单元，从而加速LRM的RL训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的reinforcement learning (RL)方法依赖于仅提供稀疏反馈的结果奖励，从而导致优化过程效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，该机制在思想层面运作，以解决基于RL的训练中的主要瓶颈。

Result: 我们的方法比仅结果奖励的基线方法以更少的训练样本实现了更高的解决问题准确率。

Conclusion: 使用结构良好的过程奖励可以显著加速数学推理任务中LRM的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CostCert是一种新颖、可扩展且精确的基于投票的认证恢复防御器，它通过一种新颖的设计来验证前k个预测中的真实标签，优于当前最先进的防御器PatchGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的认证恢复技术通常对标签之间的投票进行成对比较，但由于攻击者控制的投票数量膨胀（即攻击预算），未能精确地认证前k个预测标签中的唯一真实标签；然而，枚举投票分配的所有组合会受到组合爆炸问题的困扰。

Method: CostCert通过一种新颖的设计来验证样本在前k个预测中的真实标签，而无需成对比较和组合爆炸：即攻击样本的预算是否不足以覆盖最小的总额外投票数，从而将真实标签从前k个预测标签中排除。

Result: CostCert显著优于当前最先进的防御器PatchGuard，例如，当补丁大小为96时，CostCert保持高达57.3%的认证准确率，而PatchGuard已经降至零。

Conclusion: CostCert显著优于当前最先进的防御器PatchGuard，例如，当补丁大小为96时，CostCert保持高达57.3%的认证准确率，而PatchGuard已经降至零。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

*Tatsuya Mitomi,Fumiyasu Makinoshima,Fumiya Makihara,Eigo Segawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a differentiable agent-based simulation for dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems to balance bicycle inventory, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User demands in bike-sharing systems lead to imbalanced inventory, resulting in additional relocation costs. Optimal pricing design is challenging due to diverse users and their probabilistic choices.

Method: The authors develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to design dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems.

Result: The approach obtains a more accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss and achieves more than a 100-fold increase in convergence speed compared to conventional methods. Simulations confirm that the pricing policies can naturally induce balanced inventory.

Conclusion: The study confirms that the designed pricing policies can induce balanced inventory without manual relocation and that the cost of discounts can be minimized by setting appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal explanations for concept drift to enable targeted interventions in changing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how changes impact different systems is crucial, and explaining concept drift enables targeted interventions.

Method: The paper proposes an explanation strategy that isolates causally relevant features impacted by concept drift.

Result: The explanation strategy is evaluated on use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of the framework for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: This work extends model-based drift explanations towards causal explanations to increase the actionability of explanations.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

TL;DR: PLARE是一种新的离线强化学习方法，它使用视觉语言模型来指导agent训练，避免了手动设计奖励函数的需要，并在机器人操作任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线RL算法通常需要奖励标记数据，这引入了额外的瓶颈：奖励函数设计本身成本高昂、劳动密集且需要大量的领域专业知识。因此，需要一种不依赖于手动设计的奖励函数的方法。

Method: PLARE利用大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）为代理训练提供指导信号，通过查询VLM，基于语言任务描述对视觉轨迹片段对进行偏好标记，并使用监督对比偏好学习目标直接从这些偏好标签中训练策略，无需学习显式奖励模型。

Result: PLARE在机器人操作任务上取得了与现有VLM奖励生成方法相当或超过的性能，并在真实机器人操作任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PLARE在MetaWorld的机器人操作任务中达到了与现有VLM奖励生成方法相当或超过的性能，并在真实机器人操作任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Conclusion: Mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative information for detecting honey adulteration, and random forest outperforms other classifiers, achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting

Findings show that the proposed method successfully detects adulteration with a

Conclusion: dimensionally factorized operator learning具有高效和泛化的PDE建模优势，并为这种方法奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical

Conclusion: Coflex在网络精度和能量延迟乘积方面优于现有方法，同时实现了 1.9 倍到 9.5 倍的计算加速。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and

This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed

Method: 使用贝叶斯模型平均来处理竞争性因果结构。

Result: 研究表明，当结构不确定性为中等到高，因果效应在不同结构之间存在显著差异，且损失函数对因果效应的大小足够敏感时，模型平均是有益的。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一个解决结构不确定性的方法，并证明了在一定条件下该方法的最优性。通过模拟实验，验证了现代因果发现方法可以在一定程度上提供必要的量化。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为方向集成聚合（DEA）的自适应Q值估计组合方法，该方法通过学习方向参数来调节保守性和探索，并在连续控制任务中表现出优于静态集成策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续控制任务中的离策略强化学习关键取决于准确的Q值估计。对集成进行保守聚合（例如取最小值）通常用于减轻过度估计偏差。但是，这些静态规则是粗糙的，丢弃了来自集成的有价值信息，并且无法适应特定于任务的需求或不同的学习方案。

Method: 提出了一种方向集成聚合（DEA），这是一种自适应组合actor-critic框架中的Q值估计的聚合方法。DEA引入了两个完全可学习的方向参数：一个调节评论家一方的保守性，另一个指导演员一方的策略探索。这两个参数都是使用集成不一致加权贝尔曼误差学习的，该误差仅按其贝尔曼误差的方向对每个样本进行加权。

Result: 方向学习机制允许DEA以数据驱动的方式调整保守性和探索，从而使聚合适应不确定性水平和训练阶段。

Conclusion: DEA在各种连续控制基准和学习方案（从交互式到样本高效）中进行了评估，并证明了其相对于静态集成策略的有效性。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Motivation: The paper investigates the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.

Method: The paper proves a Verifier Trade-off Theorem.

Result: Reducing the inherent verification time of a language from f(n) to g(n), where f(n) >= g(n), requires certificates of length at least Omega(log(f(n) / g(n))).

Conclusion: This paper relates the P vs. NP problem to the existence of sub-linear certificates.

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

*Chih-Fan Hsu,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Experience Blending, a continual learning framework that uses synthetic boundary data and stored key samples to improve accuracy and mitigate forgetting, outperforming existing methods on image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of experience replay in continual learning is often limited by the sparse distribution of stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. Introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary during training serves as an implicit regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting.

Method: The paper proposes a novel training framework, Experience Blending, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. It consists of a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations, generating SBD, and an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages both stored key samples and SBD.

Result: The Experience Blending method achieves accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively, compared to nine CL baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Experience Blending method outperforms nine CL baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文对应用于边缘设备的卷积神经网络的参数高效微调 (PEFT) 方法进行了基准测试和分析。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调 (PEFT) 方法通过最小化用于将模型适应下游任务的额外参数数量来降低更新深度学习模型的计算成本。虽然在大型语言模型 (LLM) 中进行了广泛研究，但它们在边缘设备上使用的小型模型（如卷积神经网络）中的应用仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 对标准和深度可分离卷积架构应用 LoRA、DoRA 和 GaLore，以处理分布偏移和适应未见过的类别。利用最近提出的 PyTorch 分析器来比较更新模型的性能和这些 PEFT 方法与传统微调方法的计算成本。

Result: 当应用于深度可分离卷积架构时，所评估的 PEFT 方法的内存效率仅为 LLM 的一半。当以针对边缘部署优化的卷积架构为目标时，基于适配器的 PEFT 方法可以将模型更新期间的浮点运算 (FLOP) 减少高达 95%。

Conclusion: 在面向边缘部署优化的卷积架构上，基于适配器的 PEFT 方法可以将模型更新期间的浮点运算 (FLOP) 减少高达 95%。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is
online.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power

of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG methods face significant bottlenecks when handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs.

Method: training LLMs with process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability. It utilizes a modified version of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking capability and designs two process-constrained reward functions: Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) and Cost-Aware F1 (CAF).

Furthermore, the framework can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets and can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EB-gMCR, a deep learning approach to signal unmixing that overcomes limitations of traditional methods by automatically discovering the optimal number of components and scaling to large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges.

Method: reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable gating network to retain only active components while estimating their concentrations.

Result: On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near exact component estimation.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including chemical library-driven scenarios.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多智能体分层消息传递策略学习方法，并在基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分散式多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法允许学习可扩展的多智能体策略，但存在部分可观察性和诱导的非平稳性。这些挑战可以通过引入促进协调和高级规划的机制来解决。具体而言，协调和时间抽象可以通过通信（例如，消息传递）和分层强化学习（HRL）方法来实现决策。但是，优化问题限制了分层策略在多智能体系统中的适用性。因此，尚未充分探索这些方法的组合。

Method: 我们采用了封建HRL框架，并依赖于分层图结构来实现智能体之间的规划和协调。层级结构中较低级别的智能体接收来自上级别的目标，并与同一级别的相邻智能体交换消息。为了学习分层多智能体策略，我们设计了一种新的奖励分配方法，该方法基于训练较低级别的策略，以最大限度地提高与上级别相关的优势函数。

Result: 我们的方法在相关基准上与现有技术相比表现良好。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种新的有效的学习消息传递策略的多智能体层级结构的方法。我们在相关基准上的结果表明，我们的方法与现有技术相比表现良好。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效预测给定临床试验中多个地点的患者入组数量，优于已建立的基线模型。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook the dominant source of variability in clinical MR protocols, and pancreas segmentation remains a challenge with under-representation in public cross-domain benchmarks.

Method: A semi-supervised approach leveraging anatomical invariances is proposed.

Result: The semi-supervised approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques, achieving 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence segmentation. The analysis reveals insights into limited sampling variance, cross-center performance correlation, and the need for specialized solutions for cross-sequence shifts.

Conclusion: PancreasDG establishes a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging, with a semi-supervised approach demonstrating significant improvements in cross-sequence pancreas segmentation.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at
