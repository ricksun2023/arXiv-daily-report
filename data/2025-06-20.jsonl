PresPM holds significant promise for organizations\nseeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces\ntwo key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and\ninsufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce\nSimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.\nModeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive\ncomparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a\nvariety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of\ncomplexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,\nsuch as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank\nadditionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,\nit can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not\npossible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel\nactivities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely\nresemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates\nSimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM\nmethods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly\navailable simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM."}
