### [1] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，用于检测和减轻NLIDB中的分析漏洞，用户测试证实了该方法的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用自然语言界面到数据库 (NLIDB) 的应用程序系统已经普及了数据分析。 这种积极的发展也带来了一个紧迫的挑战，即帮助可能在没有统计分析背景的情况下使用这些系统的用户制定无偏见的分析问题。 尽管重要的研究集中在文本到 SQL 生成的准确性上，但解决分析问题中的认知偏差仍未得到充分的探索。

Method: 该方法引入了三个关键创新：(1)用于偏差的上下文语义映射框架；(2)分析框架，该框架可操作“难以改变”原则并指导用户进行系统数据分析；(3)优化的LLM驱动系统，该系统使用涉及多个候选对象、批评反馈和自我反思的结构化过程来生成高质量的、特定于任务的提示。

Result: 在直接用户体验评估中，82.5% 的参与者报告说对分析质量产生了积极影响。 在比较评估中，VeriMinder 的得分明显高于其他方法，在分析的具体性、全面性和准确性指标方面至少高出 20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder可以帮助用户在数据分析过程中避免“错误问题”漏洞。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

*Silvia Cappa,Lingxiao Kong,Pille-Riin Peet,Fanfu Wei,Yuchen Zhou,Jan-Christoph Kalo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Wikipedia versions in different languages are inconsistent, which affects reliability and AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This leads to factual inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training source.

Method: We developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles, defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.

Result: This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's structured content, with a focus on tabular data.

Conclusion: These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia content.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

### [3] [Shop-R1: Rewarding LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior in Online Shopping via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17842)
*Yimeng Zhang,Tian Wang,Jiri Gesi,Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Jiacheng Lin,Sinong Zhan,Vianne Gao,Ruochen Jiao,Junze Liu,Kun Qian,Yuxin Tang,Ran Xue,Houyu Zhang,Qingjun Cui,Yufan Guo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1, a new RL framework, improves LLMs' reasoning for simulating human behavior in online shopping, outperforming the baseline by 65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show potential in generating human-like behavior but their reasoning ability limits performance in downstream action prediction. Existing approaches are bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the model used to generate the rationales.

Method: A novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, Shop-R1, is introduced, which decomposes the human behavior simulation task into rationale generation and action prediction, each guided by distinct reward signals. Internal model signals guide rationale generation in a self-supervised manner, while a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling is used for action prediction.

Result: The Shop-R1 method achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed Shop-R1 framework significantly improves LLMs' ability to simulate real human behavior in online shopping environments, achieving a 65% improvement over the baseline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [4] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DG-PRM，一种动态和可泛化的过程奖励建模方法，通过奖励树和帕累托支配估计来提升模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型（PRM）主要依赖于启发式方法，难以进行跨领域泛化。LLM-as-judge虽然被提出来提供广义奖励，但当前的研究主要集中在反馈结果上，忽略了文本中嵌入的有意义的指导。此外，静态和粗粒度的评估标准难以适应复杂的过程监督。

Method: 提出了一种动态和可泛化的过程奖励建模（DG-PRM），它具有一个奖励树来捕获和存储细粒度的多维奖励标准，并动态地选择奖励信号进行逐步奖励评分。采用帕累托支配估计来识别区分性的正负对。

Result: DG-PRM在主流基准测试中取得了惊人的性能，通过密集奖励显著提升了跨任务的模型性能。DG-PRM能够很好地适应分布外场景，展示出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM在主流基准测试中表现出色，通过密集奖励显著提升了跨任务的模型性能，并能很好地适应分布外场景，展示出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的端到端口语自动评估系统，该系统使用单个Whisper-small编码器，无需转录和分部分模型，即可在减少推理时间的同时，实现优于文本基线的评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为2025 Speak & Improve Challenge开发的多部分第二语言测试的整体自动口语评估(ASA)提供有效的端到端方法。

Method: 使用单个Whisper-small编码器处理所有四个口语回答，并通过轻量级聚合器组合所有信息，然后预测最终分数。

Result: 该系统实现了0.384的均方根误差(RMSE)，优于基于文本的基线(0.44)，同时使用最多168M参数(约占Whisper-small的70%)。此外，该模型仅在语料库中44.8%的说话者上进行训练，仍然达到0.383 RMSE，表明提高了不平衡类别的性能和强大的数据效率。

Conclusion: 该系统在不使用转录和分部分模型的情况下，实现了高效的端到端口语自动评估，适用于大规模计算机辅助语言学习系统。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [6] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of AI detection tools to recognize text generated by DeepSeek, a recently published LLM, and finds that some tools are inconsistent and that humanization is an effective attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM.

Method: investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text.

Result: While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).

Conclusion: QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在获得证据后，能更理性地更新其信念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能根据上下文中的证据，更一致地根据贝叶斯定理更新其关于命题的“信念”。

Method: 提出了一个贝叶斯相干系数（BCC）指标，并生成了一个数据集来测量BCC。

Result: 结果表明，更大的、能力更强的预训练语言模型分配的置信度与贝叶斯定理更加一致。

Conclusion: 更大的、能力更强的预训练语言模型能更一致地根据贝叶斯定理更新其关于命题的“信念”。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Abstract: Despite being spoken by millions of people, Tigrinya remains severely
underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. This work
presents a comprehensive survey of NLP research for Tigrinya, analyzing over 40
studies spanning more than a decade of work from 2011 to 2025. We

applications across ten distinct downstream tasks, including morphological
processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and question-answering.
Our analysis reveals a clear trajectory from foundational, rule-based systems
to modern neural architectures, with progress consistently unlocked by resource
creation milestones. We identify key challenges rooted in Tigrinya's
morphological complexity and resource scarcity, while highlighting promising
research directions, including morphology-aware modeling, cross-lingual
transfer, and community-centered resource development. This work serves as both
a comprehensive reference for researchers and a roadmap for advancing Tigrinya

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create language models with improved performance in complex reasoning, code generation, and mathematical reasoning.

Method: The models use enhanced training strategies, including pre-training, SFT, DPO, continual pretraining with domain-specific datasets, and reinforcement learning.

Result: TeleChat2, TeleChat2.5, and T1 achieve substantial performance gains over TeleChat, with T1-115B outperforming proprietary models. TeleChat2.5 prioritizes speed, while T1 excels in complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper introduces TeleChat2, TeleChat2.5, and T1, which outperform existing models like OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. The models and their post-trained versions are publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce the latest series of TeleChat models: \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5}, and \textbf{T1}, offering a significant upgrade over
their predecessor, TeleChat. Despite minimal changes to the model architecture,
the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training
strategies in both pre-training and post-training stages. The series begins
with \textbf{TeleChat2}, which undergoes pretraining on 10 trillion
high-quality and diverse tokens. This is followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to further enhance its
capabilities. \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1} expand the pipeline by
incorporating a continual pretraining phase with domain-specific datasets,
combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code
generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. The \textbf{T1} variant is
designed for complex reasoning, supporting long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models
such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1}, including post-trained versions with 35B
and 115B parameters, to empower developers and researchers with
state-of-the-art language models tailored for diverse applications.

### [10] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了 NeuralDB，一种通过神经 KV 数据库和非线性门控检索模块编辑 LLM 中知识的框架，该框架在编辑大量事实时，既能保持编辑效果，又能保留 LLM 的一般能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效地编辑存储在大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的知识可以实现模型更新，而无需大规模训练。然而，这种编辑可能会损害 LLM 的一般能力，甚至导致在扩展到数千次编辑时忘记编辑过的事实。

Method: 将现有的线性 L&E 方法建模为查询键值 (KV) 数据库，然后提出了 NeuralDB，这是一种编辑框架，它将编辑过的事实明确地表示为一个配备了非线性门控检索模块的神经 KV 数据库。

Result: 在 ZsRE 和 CounterFacts 数据集上，使用 GPT2-XL、GPT-J (6B) 和 Llama-3 (8B) 进行了涉及编辑 10,000 个事实的综合实验。结果表明，NeuralDB 不仅在编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性方面表现出色，而且在六个代表性的文本理解和生成任务中保持了整体性能。进一步的实验表明，即使扩展到 100,000 个事实，NeuralDB 仍能保持其有效性（比之前的工作多 50 倍）。

Conclusion: NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性方面表现出色，并且在六个代表性的文本理解和生成任务中保持了整体性能。即使扩展到 100,000 个事实，NeuralDB 仍保持其有效性。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [11] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS is a new inference-time steering approach that uses gradient-based attribution to identify influential tokens and construct directional steering vectors, outperforming existing methods on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time steering approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly.

Method: GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale.

Result: GrAInS achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Conclusion: GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: LLM can generate synthetic phrase break annotations, reducing manual effort and cost and addressing data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on vast human annotations, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent variability in the speech domain further complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data.

Method: leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break annotations

Result: LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the speech domain.

Conclusion: LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TELEVAL, a new benchmark for evaluating spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese interactive settings. The benchmark focuses on evaluating the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately. Experiments show that existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models (LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world conversational scenarios.

Method: propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions.

Result: demonstrate that despite recent progress, existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks

Conclusion: Existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary

that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up

establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文档记录、描述和评估了新的 2024 年英语 GloVe 模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最初的 GloVe 模型构建于 2014 年，已被广泛使用并被认为是有用的，但语言和世界不断发展，我们认为当前的使用可以从更新的模型中受益。此外，2014 年的模型没有仔细记录所使用的确切数据版本和预处理，我们通过记录这些新模型来纠正这一点。

Method: 使用 Wikipedia、Gigaword 和 Dolma 的一个子集训练了两个词嵌入集。

Result: 通过词汇比较、直接测试和 NER 任务进行的评估表明，2024 年的向量包含新的文化和语言相关词汇，在结构化任务（如类比和相似性）上表现相当，并在最近的、时间相关的 NER 数据集（如非西方新闻专线数据）上表现出改进的性能。

Conclusion: 2024 GloVe 模型包含新的文化和语言相关词汇，在结构化任务（如类比和相似性）上表现相当，并在最近的、时间相关的 NER 数据集（如非西方新闻专线数据）上表现出改进的性能。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Motivation: 现有的大多数模型仅仅将语音视为语言内容的载体，通常忽略了人类语音中丰富的副语言和说话人特征线索，例如方言、年龄、情感和非语音发声。

Method: GOAT-SLM 采用了一种双模态头部架构，该架构将语言建模与声学实现分离，从而实现强大的语言理解，同时支持表达性和适应性语音生成。为了提高模型效率和多功能性，我们提出了一种模块化的、分阶段的训练策略，该策略使用大规模语音-文本语料库逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话人特征信息。

Result: GOAT-SLM在TELEVAL（一个多维度评估基准）上取得了良好的平衡性能，在语义和非语义任务上均表现出色，并且在处理情感、方言变化和年龄敏感的交互方面优于现有的开源模型。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上都取得了平衡的性能，并且在处理情感、方言变化和年龄敏感的交互方面优于现有的开源模型。这项工作强调了在语言内容之外进行建模的重要性，并推进了更自然、适应性更强和更具有社会意识的口语语言系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Motivation: 现有的评估主要集中在纯文本推理输出上，在很大程度上忽略了 MLLM 通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力。这项工作朝着解决这一差距迈出了第一步，评估了 MLLM 在多模态数学推理中基于代码的能力。

Method: 该框架侧重于两个关键评估方面：(1) 多模态代码生成 (MCG) 评估模型从头准确理解和构建可视化的能力。(2) 多模态代码编辑 (MCE) 评估模型进行细粒度操作的能力，其中包括三种类型：删除、修改和注释。

Result: 实验评估涉及九个主流 MLLM，结果表明现有模型在执行细粒度视觉操作方面仍然落后于人类的表现。

Conclusion: 现有模型在执行细粒度视觉操作方面仍然落后于人类的表现。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Motivation: 将大型语言模型整合到临床实践中引发了人们对准确性、潜在危害和临床医生接受度的担忧。尽管人工智能在艾滋病治疗领域前景广阔，但相关应用仍有待探索，且缺乏LLM基准研究。本研究旨在评估LLM在艾滋病管理中的当前能力，突出其优势和局限性。

Method: 我们引入了HIVMedQA，这是一个旨在评估艾滋病护理中开放式医学问题回答的基准。该数据集由在传染病医生的帮助下开发的、经过整理的、与临床相关的问题组成。我们评估了七个通用和三个医学专用的大型语言模型，应用提示工程来提高性能。我们的评估框架结合了词汇相似性和LLM-as-a-judge方法，并进行了扩展，以更好地反映临床相关性。

Result: 结果表明，Gemini 2.5 Pro在大多数维度上始终优于其他模型。值得注意的是，前三个模型中有两个是专有的。随着问题复杂性的增加，性能下降。医学微调模型并不总是优于通用模型，并且较大的模型尺寸并不是性能的可靠预测指标。推理和理解比事实回忆更具挑战性，并且观察到认知偏差，例如近因效应和现状偏差。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在艾滋病管理中的应用需要有针对性的开发和评估，以确保在临床护理中安全有效地整合。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sticky tokens in Transformer models can negatively impact embedding reliability, leading to performance drops in downstream tasks. The authors introduce a detection method and analyze the characteristics and impact of these tokens, calling for improved tokenization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based text embedding models are widely used in NLP tasks, but surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings. These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding distances and degrading downstream performance.

Method: introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens.

Result: Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about tokenization robustness.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity for enhanced tokenization strategies and model designs to lessen the effects of sticky tokens in future text embedding applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP

These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity

systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCOPE, a framework to mitigate selection bias in LLM evaluations by estimating and inverting position biases and preventing semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than demonstrating genuine understanding.

Method: introducing SCOPE, an evaluation framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues.

Result: SCOPE consistently outperformed existing debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed clearer confidence distributions over correct options.

Conclusion: This framework offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.

Conclusion: This article explores how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS) entwines with other processes of an Integrated Management System and how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI

Motivation: attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs

Method: Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP)

Result: GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents

Conclusion: GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning后的LLM更容易相信用户给的假信息，需要注意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuning提高了LLM的可用性，但也可能增加模型对用户输入的依赖，导致接受错误信息和产生幻觉。

Method: 对比instruction-tuned LLM和base models，并探索prompt结构、信息长度和警告等因素的影响。

Result: Instruction-tuned LLM更可能接受用户提供的错误信息，且instruction-tuning将易受影响的角色从助手转移到用户。

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning使LLM更容易接受用户提供的错误信息，需要系统性方法来减轻其副作用。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Prune&Comp 是一种新颖的层修剪方案，通过幅度补偿来缓解层移除导致的性能下降，在 LLaMA-3-8B 模型上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移除任何层都会导致隐藏状态的显着幅度差距，从而导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的即插即用层修剪方案Prune&Comp，该方案利用幅度补偿来缓解训练中隐藏状态的显着幅度差距。

Result: Prune&Comp 几乎将困惑度减半，并保留了原始模型 93.19% 的问答性能，比基线高 4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp通过迭代修剪和补偿循环增强了现有的层修剪指标，例如，当使用流行的块影响指标修剪LLaMA-3-8B的5层时，Prune&Comp几乎将困惑度减半，并保留了原始模型93.19％的问答性能，比基线高4.01％。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by

Motivation: 当前的研究主要集中在利用各种翻译知识到语音翻译模型中。然而，这些方法通常难以解决来自不相关噪声的干扰，并且不能充分利用翻译知识。

Method: 提出了一种新的定位和聚焦术语翻译方法。

Result: 各种数据集上的实验结果表明，

Conclusion: 该方法有效地定位了话语中的术语，并提高了术语翻译的成功率，同时保持了稳健的通用翻译性能。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了六种OCR引擎在僧伽罗语和泰米尔语上的性能，发现Surya和Document AI分别表现最佳，并引入了一个新的泰米尔语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对英语和其他高资源语言（HRL）的大量研究，解决拉丁语及其衍生文字的印刷文本的光学字符识别（OCR）问题现在可以被认为是已经解决的。然而，对于使用独特文字的低资源语言（LRL），这仍然是一个开放的问题。

Method: 对六种不同的OCR引擎在两种低资源语言（LRL）：僧伽罗语和泰米尔语上的零样本性能进行了比较分析。使用五种测量技术评估了字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在僧伽罗语中表现最佳，Document AI在泰米尔语中表现最佳。引入了一种新的合成泰米尔语OCR基准数据集。

Conclusion: Surya在所有指标上为僧伽罗语提供了最好的性能，单词错误率（WER）为2.61%。Document AI在泰米尔语的所有指标上表现出色，字符错误率（CER）非常低，为0.78%。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM 使用 LoRA 将风格特征有效地转移到指令遵循模型，从而在保持指令遵守的同时提高风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将 LLM 适应于特定的风格特征对于企业沟通至关重要，但从缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库中实现这一点具有挑战性，并且不会影响指令的遵守。

Method: 使用 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 将风格特征转移到指令遵循模型。

Result: 跨多个数据集和模型的实验表明，在保持指令遵守的同时，风格一致性得到了提高，人工评估证实了特定于品牌的约定。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM 提供了一种在 LLM 中进行风格个性化的有效途径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型推理模型 (LRM) 的新型可调后门攻击，该攻击通过数据投毒方法，在不影响答案正确性的前提下，可控地增加推理过程的长度，从而消耗更多资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型 (LRM) 已成为人工智能领域的一项重大进步，代表了一种专门的大型语言模型 (LLM)，旨在处理复杂的推理任务。LRM 的决定性特征在于其广泛的思维链 (CoT) 推理能力。

Method: 通过一种新颖的数据投毒方法实现攻击。它将一个可调触发器（重复次数表示所需的强度）与相应详细的CoT响应配对。这些响应通过指示教师LLM将受控数量的冗余细化步骤注入到正确的推理过程中来以编程方式生成。

Result: 该方法可以可靠地触发推理过程长度的可控倍数增加，而不会降低最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法可以可靠地触发推理过程长度的可控倍数增加，而不会降低最终答案的正确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

### [31] [Uncertainty Quantification for Evaluating Machine Translation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18338)
*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译模型在处理性别不明确的词汇时存在偏见，并且反偏见措施对明确和不明确的翻译实例有不同的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当源语句包含一个性别没有明确标记的词素，但目标语言的等价词需要指定性别时，模型必须从上下文和/或外部知识中推断出适当的性别。研究表明，机器翻译模型表现出有偏见的行为，即使与上下文信息冲突，也依赖于刻板印象。

Method: 使用最近提出的语义不确定性指标

Result: 在明确的实例上具有高翻译和性别准确性的模型不一定在模糊的实例中表现出预期水平的不确定性。同样，反偏见对模糊和明确的翻译实例有独立的影响。

Conclusion: MT模型在处理性别不明确的词汇时，即使在有上下文信息的情况下，也会表现出偏见，依赖刻板印象。此外，提高明确性别实例的翻译和性别准确性并不一定能提高模糊实例的不确定性，反偏见对这两种实例有独立影响。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TDR的框架，该框架通过分离任务和建模细粒度反馈来改进ICL的示例检索，并在30个NLP任务上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的有效性在很大程度上依赖于这些示例的质量，而之前的工作主要集中在增强示例检索能力上，并取得了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，在检索高质量示例方面仍然存在两个挑战：(1)难以区分跨任务数据分布，(2)难以在检索器输出和来自LLM的反馈之间建立细粒度的连接。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为TDR的新框架。TDR将来自不同任务的ICL示例分离，这使得检索模块能够在多任务数据集中检索特定于目标任务的示例。此外，TDR对来自LLM的细粒度反馈进行建模，以监督和指导检索模块的训练，这有助于检索高质量的示例。

Result: 我们在一套30个NLP任务上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明TDR在所有数据集上持续改进了结果，并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TDR在所有数据集上持续改进了结果，并实现了最先进的性能。同时，我们的方法是一种即插即用的方法，可以很容易地与各种LLM结合，以提高ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Motivation: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task complexity and limited high-quality labeled data.

Method: combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM) assistance

Result: significant improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency by LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline

Conclusion: This paper contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection systems, supporting transparent and accountable media ecosystems.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: CLEAR is an interactive tool for in-depth error analysis of LLMs, going beyond simple scores to identify specific issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation paradigms provide a single score or ranking, obscuring the specific reasons behind a model's performance.

Method: CLEAR generates per-instance textual feedback, creates system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each issue. It also provides an interactive dashboard for comprehensive error analysis.

Result: CLEAR enables comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, interactive filters, and drill-down to individual instances.

Conclusion: The paper introduces CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis, demonstrated on RAG and Math benchmarks with a user case study.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinDPO 是一种金融专用 LLM 框架，它优于现有模型，并且在实际交易成本下保持了积极的回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融相关文本数据中表达的观点对交易决策和市场走势产生越来越深刻的影响。监督微调 (SFT) 大型语言模型 (LLM) 已成为金融情绪分析的事实标准。然而，SFT 范式可能导致训练数据的记忆，并且通常无法推广到未见过的样本。这在金融领域是一个关键的限制，在金融领域，模型必须适应以前未观察到的事件以及金融的细微的、特定领域的语言。

Method: 提出了一种基于直接偏好优化 (DPO) 的金融专用 LLM 框架 FinDPO。

Result: FinDPO 在标准情感分类基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，平均优于现有监督微调模型 11%。

Conclusion: FinDPO在标准情感分类基准测试中表现出色，平均优于现有监督微调模型 11%。模拟表明，即使在 5 个基点的实际交易成本下，FinDPO 也是第一个维持每年 67% 的可观正回报和强大的风险调整后表现（如 2.0 的 Sharpe 比率所示）的情感方法。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

Conclusion: LLMs在需要更深层次的推理和事实核查的任务中仍然面临重大的认知挑战。这表明未来在改进复杂表格推理任务的性能方面存在大量机会。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically

punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic review of synthetic medical text generation, focusing on its purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods. It finds that synthetic text is useful for various NLP tasks but raises privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i) the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation methods. The authors searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text and identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones.

Result: A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text, especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic medical text.

Conclusion: The generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents and has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of data transfer.

Motivation: LLM的自注意力机制不可避免地将注意力分散在所有对上，从而削弱了对关键关系的关注，特别是在具有复杂依赖关系或语义模糊特征的数据集中。

Method: GraDe，一种将稀疏依赖图显式集成到LLM注意力机制中的新方法。

Result: GraDe在复杂数据集上优于现有的基于LLM的方法高达12%，并在合成数据质量方面取得了与最先进方法相媲美的结果。

Conclusion: GraDe在复杂数据集上优于现有的基于LLM的方法，但在合成数据质量方面与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

*Jiafeng Xiong,Yuting Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GIIFT，一个使用多模态场景图的图像自由多模态翻译框架，在没有图像的情况下也能实现最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MMT方法在利用模态差距方面面临挑战，因为它们强制执行严格的视觉-语言对齐，同时被限制在训练的多模态领域内进行推理。

Method: 构建了新的多模态场景图，并引入了一个两阶段的图引导归纳图像自由MMT框架GIIFT，该框架使用跨模态图注意力网络适配器。

Result: 在Multi30K数据集上的英法和英德任务的实验结果表明，GIIFT超过了现有方法并达到了最先进的水平，即使在推理过程中没有图像也是如此。在WMT基准测试上的结果表明，相对于无图像翻译基线有显着改进。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合tokenization策略，通过结合6-mer和BPE-600来提高DNA语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的k-mer tokenization在捕获局部DNA序列结构方面有效，但面临token分布不均和对全局序列上下文理解有限的挑战。

Method: 结合6-mer tokenization和Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600)的混合tokenization策略

Result: 在next-k-mer预测任务中，使用混合词汇表训练的基础DLM的性能显著提高，3-mers的预测准确率为10.78%，4-mers为10.1%，5-mers为4.12%，优于NT、DNABERT2和GROVER等模型。

Conclusion: 混合tokenization策略通过结合6-mer tokenization和BPE-600，显著提高了DNA语言模型（DLMs）的性能，为基因组语言建模奠定了基础，并为未来的DNA序列分析和生物学研究提供了支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

*Feng Hong,Geng Yu,Yushi Ye,Haicheng Huang,Huangjie Zheng,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出WINO算法，通过可撤销解码来改善DLLM的质量-速度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DLLM存在严重的质量-速度权衡问题，更快的并行解码会导致显著的性能下降。这归因于DLLM中标准解码的不可逆性，标准解码容易被极化为错误的解码方向，并伴随早期错误上下文的累积。

Method: 提出了一种名为Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO)的无训练解码算法，该算法支持DLLM中的可撤销解码。WINO采用并行草案和验证机制，积极起草多个token，同时使用模型的双向上下文来验证和重新屏蔽可疑token以进行细化。

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准测试中，推理速度提高了6倍，同时准确率提高了2.58%；在Flickr30K字幕生成中，实现了10倍的加速，同时获得了更高的性能。

Conclusion: WINO算法在LLaDA和MMaDA等开源DLLM中得到验证，能够显著改善质量-速度的权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),
Self-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SRAG), and Multi-Round Accumulative Voting

stability and performance. Our system, based on the Qwen2.5-7B model, achieves
a Hard Score of 26.66, a Soft Score of 48.35, and an Average Score of 37.505 on
the STATE ToxiCN dataset, significantly outperforming baselines such as GPT-4o

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for specialized domains, achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 at a fraction of the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks.

Method: AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for specialized domains from unlabeled data, incorporating Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type.

Result: A dataset of 703k examples is constructed. AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. The generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AQuilt achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 with only 17% of the production cost and generates data with higher relevance to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

*Andreea Nica,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Saibo Geng,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈纳入提示模型的训练中，生成最先进的查询特定提示，从而提升大型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示优化可以提高大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，而无需更新目标模型的参数。该领域主要沿着两个方向发展：一种方法使用文本反馈从通用LLM中提取改进的提示，而另一种方法则依靠数值奖励来训练一个特殊的提示模型，该模型专门为目标模型提供最佳提示。

Method: 引入了文本奖励提示框架（TRPrompt），该框架将文本反馈直接整合到提示模型的训练中，无需先验数据集收集，并通过对生成的提示的反馈进行迭代改进。

Result: 当与LLM内化“好”提示概念的能力相结合时，文本奖励提供的高分辨率信号允许我们训练一个提示模型，从而为GSMHard和MATH等具有挑战性的数学数据集中的问题生成最先进的、特定于查询的提示。

Conclusion: TRPrompt框架可以通过将文本反馈直接整合到提示模型的训练中，来训练一个提示模型，从而为GSMHard和MATH等具有挑战性的数学数据集中的问题生成最先进的、特定于查询的提示。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions. Using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction following.

Method: Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF)

Result: RLCF is the only method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a 3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: checklist feedback is a key tool for improving language models' support of queries

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一个从头训练的自回归模型，在图像生成等方面可媲美 DALL-E 3，并具有多任务处理能力和高效解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视并复兴自回归范式，以实现高质量的图像生成及其他应用。现有方法依赖于预训练组件或混合架构，限制了架构设计和许可自由。

Method: 从头开始训练的自回归模型，采用统一的 Tokenization 方案，并结合了推断时缩放和推测性 Jacobi 采样等高效解码策略。

Result: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 在文本到图像基准测试中与扩散模型相匹配甚至在某些情况下超过了扩散模型，并且在 Graph200K 基准测试中表现出色，证明了其多任务能力。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一个强大且灵活的多模态生成基础模型，在统一框架内可以处理各种任务，性能与最先进的扩散模型相媲美，并且具有高效的解码策略。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,

Method: 结合时间运动差异采样和自监督学习的轻量级视频理解模型 SV3.3B，采用 DWT-VGG16-LDA 关键帧提取机制和 V-DWT-JEPA2 编码器，以及 LLM 解码器。

Result: SV3.3B 在 NSVA 篮球数据集子集上表现优异，在文本生成和运动特定评估标准上均优于大型闭源模型（包括 GPT-4o 变体），且计算需求更低。

Conclusion: SV3.3B 在运动描述生成方面表现出色，信息密度、动作复杂度和测量精度指标均优于 GPT-4o。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Motivation: 文本到图像 (T2I) 生成的最新进展带来了令人印象深刻的视觉效果。然而，这些模型在处理复杂的提示时仍然面临重大挑战，特别是那些涉及具有不同属性的多个主体的提示。

Method: 我们提出了 Detail++，这是一个免训练框架，它引入了一种新颖的渐进式细节注入 (PDI) 策略。

Result: Detail++显著优于现有方法，特别是在涉及多个对象和复杂风格条件的情况下。

Conclusion: Detail++显著优于现有方法，特别是在涉及多个对象和复杂风格条件的情况下。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture for image restoration that uses Dilated Neighborhood Attention and a channel-aware module to balance global context and local precision, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors, effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration, primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local attention.

Method: We introduce a channel-aware module that complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for image restoration.

Result: achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks

Conclusion: The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Conclusion: The approach improves existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia-->Cityscapes.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPEN 是一个用于支持人工智能驱动的参与度识别的新型数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线教育和虚拟康复中，参与虚拟学习对于参与者的满意度、表现和依从性至关重要，在这些环境中，互动交流起着关键作用。然而，准确衡量虚拟群体环境中的参与度仍然是一个挑战。人们越来越有兴趣使用人工智能（AI）进行大规模、真实世界、自动化的参与度识别。虽然参与度已在年轻的学术人群中得到广泛研究，但针对虚拟和远程医疗学习环境中老年人的研究和数据集仍然有限。现有方法通常忽略了背景相关性和跨会话的参与度的纵向性质。

Method: 收集自11名老年人，他们在为期六周的每周虚拟小组学习课程中参与了心脏康复，产生了超过35小时的数据，使其成为同类数据集中最大的数据集。为了保护隐私，原始视频被保留；相反，发布的数据包括面部、手部和身体关节的标志，以及从视频中提取的情感和行为特征。注释包括二元参与状态、情感和行为标签以及上下文类型指标，例如教师是面向小组还是个人。

Result: 多个机器学习和深度学习模型接受了训练，实现了高达81%的参与度识别准确率。

Conclusion: OPEN提供了一个可扩展的基础，用于对老年人群进行个性化参与度建模，并为更广泛的参与度识别研究做出贡献。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated system using YOLO models for real-time video analysis of bearded dragon behavior, with reliable basking detection but less accurate hunting detection due to weak cricket detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting.

Method: We trained five YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of 1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific behaviours.

Result: Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).

Conclusion: This automated system offers a scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments, significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Motivation: 现有的数据集主要集中在地面视角，而地面红外系统存在遮挡、覆盖范围有限和容易受到阻碍等问题，这些问题可以通过 aerial 视角得到独特的解决。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的三流架构TCC-VPReID，旨在解决跨平台和跨模态行人重识别的联合挑战。通过风格稳健的特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适应和中间引导的时间建模，弥合了 aerial-ground 视角和 RGB-IR 模态之间的域差距。

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR 数据集提出了独特的挑战，与现有数据集相比，TCC-VPReID 框架取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: TCC-VPReID框架在多个评估协议中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 该研究调查了标签偏差如何影响医学影像人工智能的公平性，发现标签偏差对模型特征表示有显著影响，且子群性能因验证集标签而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据集中影响特定子群的系统性错误标记（即标签偏差）是医学人工智能系统中一个关于公平性的未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 使用EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED)训练深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类，其中标签偏差影响可分离的子群（基于成像制造商）或不可分离的“伪子群”。

Result: 发现模拟的子群标签偏差导致模型学习到的特征表示发生显著变化。重要的是，特征空间内的这些变化取决于受标签偏差影响的子群的相对大小和可分离性。还观察到子群性能的显著差异，这取决于是否使用带有干净标签的验证集来定义模型的分类阈值。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，标签偏差对模型学习到的特征表示有显著影响，并且这种影响取决于受标签偏差影响的子群的大小和可分离性。使用带有偏差标签的验证集定义分类阈值会导致子群性能的显著差异。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

Conclusion: 提出了一种可优化的成本函数，该函数基于变换后的基，可以应用于任何仿射子空间的配准问题。该方法能够通过直接最小化测地距离找到全局最优解，并且在各种计算机视觉任务中都优于现有解决方案。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练数据集和三个不同的微调数据集上显著优于Baseline CoCa。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构提高了跨视觉语言领域的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable

introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment

high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: ViGText, a novel graph-based approach integrating images and VLLM Text explanations, improves deepfake detection with enhanced generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks.

Method: ViGText integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework. It divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Result: ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation. ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. It limits classification performance degradation to less than 4% when facing targeted attacks.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new standard for detecting deepfakes by using detailed visual and textual analysis, ensuring media authenticity and information integrity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions.

Method: We propose the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the TAV dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding

Result: post-training on the TAV dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: post-training on the TAV dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: 实现了高质量和高保真度的结果。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

TL;DR: VLM-IMI 是一种用于 LLIE 的新框架，它利用具有迭代和手动指令 (IMI) 的大型视觉语言模型 (VLM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数弱光图像增强 (LLIE) 方法依赖于预训练模型先验、弱光输入或两者，而忽略了正常光图像提供的语义指导。这种限制阻碍了它们在复杂光照条件下的有效性。

Method: 利用具有迭代和手动指令 (IMI) 的大型视觉语言模型 (VLM)。

Result: VLM-IMI 结合了所需正常光内容的文本描述作为增强线索，从而实现语义知情的恢复。我们引入了一种指令先验融合模块，该模块动态对齐和融合图像和文本特征，从而促进生成详细且语义连贯的输出。

Conclusion: VLM-IMI在定量指标和感知质量方面均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS, a text-driven adaptation of SAM, enables efficient and robust automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised deep learning models for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS are error-prone and require large, expert-curated datasets due to speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS.

Method: A text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) using text prompt learning and LoRA-based adaptation.

Result: TextSAM-EUS achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, and 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD with manual prompts on the Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS provides an efficient and robust method for automatic EUS segmentation, outperforming existing SOTA models.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HDF显著提高了识别准确率和鲁棒性，在各种不平衡场景中保持了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage training framework, integrating supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, consistently outperforms existing VTG models, especially in challenging scenarios. The authors also release datasets, models, and code.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Motivation: Algonauts 2025 挑战赛呼吁社区开发编码模型，以预测对自然多模态电影的整个大脑 fMRI 反应。

Method: 我们提出了一个序列到序列的 Transformer，它可以从视觉、听觉和语言输入自回归地预测 fMRI 活动。

Result: 我们的模型在同分布和异分布数据上均表现出色

Conclusion: 该模型在同分布和异分布数据上均表现出色，证明了时间感知、多模态序列建模对于大脑活动预测的有效性。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于检测异常值 (OoD) 样本的自由能后验网络，该网络通过学习参数直接估计不确定性，无需随机抽样，并在真实世界基准上表现出有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从深度神经网络估计不确定性是检测异常值 (OoD) 样本的一种广泛使用的方法，异常值通常表现出较高的预测不确定性。 然而，传统的蒙特卡罗 (MC) Dropout 等方法通常只关注模型或数据不确定性，而未能与 OoD 检测的语义目标保持一致。

Method: 该方法引入了两个关键贡献：(1) 由 Beta 分布参数化的基于自由能的密度估计器，它能够对模糊或看不见的区域附近的细粒度不确定性进行估计；(2) 集成在后验网络中的损失，从而可以直接从学习的参数中进行不确定性估计，而无需随机抽样。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界基准（包括 Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly 和 Segment-Me-If-You-Can）上验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，即自由能后验网络，该框架共同对分布不确定性进行建模，并使用自由能识别 OoD 和错误分类区域。 通过将该方法与残差预测分支 (RPL) 框架集成，该方法超越了事后能量阈值处理，并使网络能够通过利用 Beta 分布的方差来学习 OoD 区域，从而产生在语义上有意义且计算效率高的不确定性感知分割解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Motivation: 虽然基于扩散的方法由于其强大的生成能力而显示出有希望的性能。然而，它们对退化的单向建模通常难以捕捉真实世界退化模式的复杂性，导致结构不一致和像素未对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估方面均优于现有技术方法，同时有效地推广到不同的退化场景。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of
accuracy and computational speed when deployed on Field-Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGAs). However, despite these advances, state-of-the-art YOLO-based
object detection and classification systems continue to face challenges in
achieving resource efficiency suitable for edge FPGA platforms. To address this
limitation, this paper presents a resource-efficient real-time object detection
and classification system based on YOLOv5 optimized for FPGA deployment. The
proposed system is trained on the COCO and GTSRD datasets and implemented on
the Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA board. Experimental results demonstrate a
classification accuracy of 99%, with a power consumption of 3.5W and a
processing speed of 9 frames per second (FPS). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling real-time,
resource-efficient object detection and classification for edge computing

Conclusion: 结合对比预训练和精炼的集成伪标签，可以有效弥合复杂的领域差距，而无需目标领域注释。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba结合了UNet和Mamba机制，通过噪声降低模块来提高在数据稀缺的医学图像分割任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺的情况下，深度学习模型经常过度拟合噪声和不相关的模式，这限制了它们泛化到未见样本的能力。为了解决医学图像分割中的这些挑战。

Method: 我们介绍了一种新颖的架构Diff-UMamba，它结合了UNet框架和用于建模远程依赖关系的Mamba机制。Diff-UMamba的核心是一个噪声降低模块（NRM），它采用信号差分策略来抑制编码器内嘈杂或不相关的激活。

Result: 该架构实现了更高的分割精度和鲁棒性，特别是在低数据设置中。Diff-UMamba在多个公共数据集上进行了评估，包括MSD（肺和胰腺）和AIIB23，在不同的分割任务中，与基线方法相比，性能始终提高1-3%。在锥形束CT（CBCT）中的总肿瘤体积（GTV）分割上，与基线相比，提高了4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在多个公共数据集上进行了评估，包括MSD（肺和胰腺）和AIIB23，在不同的分割任务中，与基线方法相比，性能始终提高1-3%。为了进一步评估在有限数据条件下的性能，通过改变可用训练样本的比例，在BraTS-21数据集上进行了额外的实验。该方法还在一个小的内部非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）数据集上进行了验证，用于锥形束CT（CBCT）中的总肿瘤体积（GTV）分割，与基线相比，提高了4-5%。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL 是一种自监督学习架构，它使用门控特征融合，在少量未标记数据的情况下有效适应金相领域，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料的显微照片分析依赖于监督方法，这需要为每个新数据集重新训练，并且在只有少量标记样本的情况下通常表现不一致。虽然 SSL 通过利用未标记数据提供了一种有希望的替代方案，但大多数现有方法仍然依赖于大规模数据集才能有效。

Method: 采用门控特征融合的自监督学习 (SSL) 架构

Result: 在 MetalDAM 上实现了 69.13% 的 mIoU，优于 ImageNet 预训练编码器实现的 66.73%，并且与使用 MicroNet 预训练的模型相比，在环境屏障涂层基准数据集 (EBC) 上的平均 mIoU 持续提高了近 40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL在少量未标记数据的情况下，能够有效适应金相领域，同时保留了从自然图像大规模预训练中学习到的丰富且可转移的特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high inference costs.

Method: a novel and efficient distillation method that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy by fusing conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations

Result: the student model achieves inference speeds up to 6x faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex sampling approach

Conclusion: TeEFusion allows the student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more efficient sampling strategy, achieving inference speeds up to 6x faster while maintaining comparable image quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models in medical image segmentation lack specific adjustments for segmentation tasks and have deficiencies in feature extraction.

Method: The authors propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation model grounded in latent diffusion models. During fine-tuning, they replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the segmentation map and employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for different disease types.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the performance of the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for different disease types, without altering the model architecture, increasing the number of parameters, or computation during inference, making it highly efficient.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

TL;DR: GSDTTA是一种用于3D点云分类的新方法，它通过在图谱域中进行自适应调整，实现了更高效的自适应，并且优于现有的TTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D TTA方法依赖于计算密集型的空间域优化，并且可能需要额外的训练数据，但是由于3D点云的不规则和无序结构，测试时自适应(TTA)方法在3D点云上的应用受到了阻碍。

Method: 将适应性调整转移到图谱域，通过图傅里叶变换（GFT）将目标域中的点云表示为异常值感知图，并通过优化最低10%的频率分量来进行适应性调整。利用特征图引导的自训练策略来改进光谱调整和模型参数。

Result: GSDTTA的有效性已通过基准数据集上的实验结果和消融研究得到证实。

Conclusion: GSDTTA在基准数据集上优于现有的3D点云分类TTA方法。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Conclusion: DATA在三个典型数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并在严重的通信延迟和姿态误差下保持了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular depth estimation methods are ineffective in low-light environments due to the lack of robust foundational models and high-quality paired depth datasets for such conditions.

Method: The method includes a flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to generate paired depth datasets for low-light conditions, along with a low-light PEFT strategy using illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces DepthDark, a foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging nighttime datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Motivation: this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods highly fragile in real-world challenges

Result: enhance the resilience of ISTD models against various challenges, significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of the synthetic samples

Conclusion: Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dental caries, but not periodontitis, causes lung cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational studies suggest links between periodontitis, dental caries and lung cancer, but causality remains uncertain.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to explore causal relationships between dental traits and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess mediation by pulmonary function. Inverse variance weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed using the delta method.

Result: Dental caries have a significant positive causal effect on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Periodontitis showed no causal effect. The effect of dental caries is partially mediated by declines in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).

Conclusion: Dental caries have a causal role in lung cancer risk, and integrating dental care and pulmonary function monitoring into cancer prevention strategies is recommended.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra

effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

Conclusion: FieldLVLM显著优于现有方法，为大型视觉-语言模型在科学研究中的应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)描绘，即有意义的波形特征的分割，对于临床诊断至关重要。尽管最近使用深度学习取得了进展，但由于公开可用的带注释数据集的稀缺，进展受到了限制。半监督学习通过利用丰富的未标记心电图数据，提供了一个有希望的解决方案。

Conclusion: Transformer在半监督心电图描绘中优于卷积网络。该基准将作为推进半监督心电图描绘方法的基础，并将促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Result: SGCDet实现了有效和高效的自适应体积构建。

Conclusion: SGCDet在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that incorporating frequency information via colorization enhances species distinction and improves classification accuracy, achieving statistically significant gains over existing models.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. Fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges.

Method: A novel plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and feedforward networks to learn offsets.

Result: GDCUnet has achieved state of the art performance on public datasets. The proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model representation and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed GDCUnet model achieves state-of-the-art performance in fundus blood vessel segmentation and the deformable convolutional module enhances model representation and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant outperformance on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB) datasets, especially in long-term generation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly outperforms existing quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term generation scenarios.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: construct a higher-quality dataset and design a progressive training strategy to improve the performance of material estimation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: absence of constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task and previous works simplified material data and rendering equation lead to rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin

Method: design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy and a Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR) loss

Result: construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF) based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, produce displacement and subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially for the skin

Conclusion: achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and

TL;DR: SynC通过重新分配标题来优化合成图像-标题数据集，从而提高零样本图像描述的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 零样本图像描述（ZIC）越来越多地利用文本到图像（T2I）模型生成的合成数据集，以减少对昂贵的手动注释的需求。然而，这些T2I模型经常产生与其相应的输入标题表现出语义错位的图像（例如，缺少对象、不正确的属性），从而导致嘈杂的合成图像-标题对，这会阻碍模型训练。现有的数据集修剪技术主要用于删除网络爬取数据中的噪声文本。然而，这些方法不适合合成数据的独特挑战，在合成数据中，标题通常格式良好，但图像可能是不准确的表示。

Method: 我们引入SynC，这是一个专门为ZIC优化合成图像-标题数据集的新框架。SynC侧重于将标题重新分配给合成图像池中语义上最对齐的图像，而不是传统的过滤或重新生成。我们的方法采用了一种一对多的映射策略，首先为每个标题检索多个相关的候选图像。然后，我们应用一种受循环一致性启发的对齐评分器，通过验证其通过图像到文本检索来检索原始标题的能力来选择最佳图像。

Result: 广泛的评估表明，SynC在标准基准（MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps）上的各种ZIC模型中始终如一地显着提高了性能，并在几种情况下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SynC提供了一种有效的策略来管理精炼的合成数据，以增强零样本图像描述。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFFSNet improves medical image segmentation by decoupling and quantifying connectivity features, outperforming existing methods on ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized mechanism to quantify different feature strengths.

Method: DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network) with a feature space decoupling strategy to quantify the relative strength between connectivity features and other features, and a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation architecture to dynamically balance multi-scale feature expression.

Result: On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed CMUNet by 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).

Conclusion: DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods across all metrics, effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation, achieves smooth edge transitions, and significantly enhances clinical usability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve V-JEPA pre-training for ultrasound video segmentation, achieving significant performance gains, especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, and V-JEPA is a promising SSL framework for video data. However, ViTs can underperform on small medical datasets.

Method: The paper proposes a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT representations during V-JEPA pre-training.

Result: V-JEPA with the auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly, with gains up to 3.4% using 100% and up to 8.35% using only 10% of the training data.

Conclusion: V-JEPA with the proposed 3D localisation auxiliary task significantly improves segmentation performance in ultrasound imaging across various frozen encoder configurations.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with limited training data via non-linear manifold learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.

Method: a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker decomposition) and feed forward neural networks.

Result: Achieved real-time performance with limited training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an object from facial landmarks.

Conclusion: The model is very fast in predicting unseen data once the underlying manifold for rotation around each axis is learned.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Motivation: 在流体力学中，对底层流动物理学的理解与准确预测同等重要。

Method: 通过使用PySR库，直接从数值模拟数据中导出紧凑的符号方程。

Result: 这些方程不仅近似于研究的流体流动中观察到的抛物线速度分布和压降，而且与文献中的解析解完全吻合。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了SR将复杂的流动行为简化为简洁、可解释的方程式的能力，以及知识表示方法在提高数据驱动的SR模型与领域原则的可靠性和一致性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

Motivation: 现有用于数据分析的智能体系统强调通过多智能体框架和编排层实现洞察力生成的自动化，但它们通常忽略了分析思维背后的结构化推理过程。现实世界的数据分析需要一致的认知工作流程：解释模糊的目标，将其扎根于上下文知识中，构建抽象计划，并根据中间结果调整执行。

Method: I2I-STRADA，一种旨在形式化推理过程的智能体架构，它专注于通过反映分析推理的认知步骤的模块化子任务来建模分析如何展开。

Conclusion: I2I-STRADA在规划连贯性和洞察力对齐方面优于现有系统，突出了结构化认知工作流程在数据分析智能体设计中的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Conclusion: SmartAPS provides operations planners with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an

customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited

MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

Motivation: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints.

Result: The system is evaluated on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging, demonstrating automation of feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing without manual intervention. Specific examples include data anonymization and feature extraction using embedding-based and MedGemma-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Agentic AI framework automates the clinical data pipeline, reducing the need for expert intervention and offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有平均值作为聚合函数的图神经网络（GNN）的表达能力。

Method: 图神经网络（GNN）与平均作为聚合函数。

Result: 在非均匀设置中，这种GNN具有与比率模态逻辑完全相同的表达能力，比具有最大聚合的GNN的表达能力更高，但低于总和聚合。在均匀设置中，相对于MSO，其表达能力恰好是无交替模态逻辑的表达能力。

Conclusion: 在均匀设置中，相对于MSO，平均GNN的表达能力严格低于总和GNN和最大GNN。当任何假设被删除时，表达能力都会增加。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [122] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning in LLMs, and finds that reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, and knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the capacity to distinguish between knowledge and reasoning plays a pivotal role in model analysis, interpretability, and development

Method: a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively.

Result: reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers

Conclusion: reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains and potentially impairing knowledge-intensive domains. Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

TL;DR: Four different semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming are compared. Three of them coincide and are stronger than the fourth approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: comparing semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of model minimality

Method: comparing four different semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming

Result: three of these approaches coincide, constituting a common single approach under different definitions; this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a program and is strictly stronger than the fourth approach

Conclusion: Forks, Justified Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics coincide, constituting a common single approach under different definitions. This common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a program and is strictly stronger than Strongly Supported Models.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Conclusion: 未来工作旨在开发一个正式的模型和有效的算法，以增强人工智能风险评估，将理论见解与实际应用联系起来，以支持负责任的人工智能治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Motivation: The marking problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with respect to a ground truth solution.

Method: A combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver, and a term rewriting system is used. A Large Language Model interprets and corrects student responses.

Result: The system's performance was evaluated on a dataset of real-world student exam responses.

Conclusion: The system was evaluated on 1500 student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Motivation: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty.

Method: We introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.

Result: Using this benchmark, we evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces IBRO, a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative and generalizable. The result is consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the development of principled methodologies for LLM reasoning.

Method: We introduce IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method.

Result: IB regularization demonstrates consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms.

Conclusion: IB regularization consistently improves LLM reasoning performance across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Method: 比较了基于模型的价值迭代（VI）方法和基于模型的近端策略优化（PPO）方法。

Result: 经过 1,000 次测试，PPO 始终获得最高奖励，同时客户等待时间和员工空闲时间最短。

Conclusion: PPO 在最小化客户等待时间和员工空闲时间方面表现最佳，尽管需要更长的训练时间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated Compact-Table algorithm for efficiently handling large Table constraints in constraint programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases are too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based approaches.

Method: The Compact-Table (CT) algorithm is enhanced by exploiting the computational power of modern GPUs.

Result: The design and implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, its integration into an existing constraint solver, and an experimental validation performed on a significant set of instances are reported.

Conclusion: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated version of the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm for handling large Table constraints.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Motivation: RAG systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality.

Method: introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary (HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is.

Result: achieving absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset.

Conclusion: The VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point

often not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item
catalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user
frustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased
number of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task
of Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query
Performance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a
search engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational
performance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic
information contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.
Specifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed
representation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the
classification labels to predict the evaluation turn. Our evaluation scenario
addressed two recommendation scenarios, by differentiating between system
failure, where the system is unable to find the target, and catalogue failure,
where the target does not exist in the item catalogue. In our experiments using
the Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets, we measure the accuracy of predictors
for both system and catalogue failures. Our results demonstrate the promise of
our proposed predictors for predicting system failures (existing evaluation
scenario), while we detect a considerable decrease in predictive performance in
the case of catalogue failure prediction (when inducing a missing item
scenario) compared to system failures.

TL;DR: 提出了 Fashion-AlterEval，一个新的数据集，其中包含人类对选择的替代项目的判断，通过在常见的时尚 CRS 数据集中添加新的注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于需要大量数据，因此用户模拟器用于训练和评估。 这种用户模拟器基于对单个目标项目的了解来批评当前检索到的项目。 然而，在具有模拟器的离线设置中进行系统评估受到对单个目标项目以及他们在大量轮次中无限耐心的关注的限制。

Method: 提出了两种新的元用户模拟器，它们使用收集的判断，并允许模拟用户不仅表达他们对替代项目的偏好，还可以改变他们的想法和耐心程度。

Result: 使用 Shoes 和 Fashion IQ 作为原始数据集和三个 CRS 模型进行的实验表明，模拟器对替代方案的了解会对现有 CRS 模型的评估产生相当大的影响，特别是现有的单目标评估低估了它们的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过使用模拟器对替代方案的知识，可以对现有 CRS 模型进行评估，特别是在模拟用户可以考虑替代相关项目时，系统可以快速响应以更快地满足用户。

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RecPS, a membership-inference attack (MIA)-based privacy scoring method, to measure privacy risks in recommender systems (RecSys) at both the interaction and user levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users of such systems should have the right to choose not to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment.

Method: We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation.

Result: RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method.

Conclusion: We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known

*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper uses LLM-based text embedders for prior case retrieval (PCR), outperforming traditional and supervised methods by addressing the limitations of legal text length and training data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IR methods are still dominant in PCR, while deep learning IR methods face challenges such as lengthy legal text limitation and lack of legal training data.

Method: Leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR in an unsupervised manner.

Result: LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths and do not require training data, addressing both challenges simultaneously.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art LLM-based text embedders outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models in four PCR benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 可以在零样本设置中预测前提技能，而无需特定于任务的微调，从而为个性化学习、智能辅导和基于技能的推荐系统等应用提供可扩展的前提技能建模。

Abstract: Prerequisite skills - foundational competencies required before mastering
more advanced concepts - are important for supporting effective learning,
assessment, and skill-gap analysis. Traditionally curated by domain experts,
these relationships are costly to maintain and difficult to scale. This paper
investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict prerequisite
skills in a zero-shot setting, using only natural language descriptions and
without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce ESCO-PrereqSkill, a benchmark
dataset constructed from the ESCO taxonomy, comprising 3,196 skills and their
expert-defined prerequisite links. Using a standardized prompting strategy, we
evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 4,
Qwen2, and DeepSeek, across semantic similarity, BERTScore, and inference
latency. Our results show that models such as LLaMA4-Maverick,
Claude-3-7-Sonnet, and Qwen2-72B generate predictions that closely align with
expert ground truth, demonstrating strong semantic reasoning without
supervision. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable
prerequisite skill modeling for applications in personalized learning,
intelligent tutoring, and skill-based recommender systems.

TL;DR: FastMMRec uses GCNs only during testing to improve efficiency and scalability in multimodal recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The efficiency and scalability of GCNs in training recommender systems are critical challenges, especially in multimodal recommendation, leading to sub-optimal accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes FastMMRec, a multimodal recommendation framework that uses graph convolutions only during the testing phase.

Result: Using GCNs only in the testing phase improves efficiency, scalability, and alleviates modality isolation.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates FastMMRec's superior performance over baselines on three datasets, achieving efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in
training recommender systems remain critical challenges, hindering their
practical deployment in real-world scenarios. In the multimodal recommendation
(MMRec) field, training GCNs requires more expensive time and space costs and
exacerbates the gap between different modalities, resulting in sub-optimal
recommendation accuracy. This paper critically points out the inherent
challenges associated with adopting GCNs during the training phase in MMRec,
revealing that GCNs inevitably create unhelpful and even harmful pairs during
model optimization and isolate different modalities. To this end, we propose
FastMMRec, a highly efficient multimodal recommendation framework that deploys
graph convolutions exclusively during the testing phase, bypassing their use in
training. We demonstrate that adopting GCNs solely in the testing phase
significantly improves the model's efficiency and scalability while alleviating
the modality isolation problem often caused by using GCNs during the training
phase. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently
demonstrating the performance superiority of FastMMRec over competitive
baselines while achieving efficiency and scalability.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: STEER是一个私有向量检索框架，它利用不同嵌入模型的对齐关系来保护查询文本的隐私，同时保持检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VDB服务提供商主要使用专有的黑盒模型，用户被迫通过API向他们公开原始查询文本，以换取向量检索服务。因此，如果查询文本涉及金融或医疗领域的机密记录，这种机制不可避免地导致用户敏感信息的严重泄露。

Method: 利用不同嵌入模型的语义空间之间的对齐关系来推导查询文本的近似嵌入。

Result: STEER的Recall@100基本上可以实现小于5%的下降。此外，即使在数百万条条目的文本语料库中搜索，STEER的Recall@20准确率也比当前基线高20%。

Conclusion: STEER在保护查询文本隐私的同时，保持了检索准确性。即使近似嵌入是专有模型的嵌入的近似值，它们仍然可以防止提供商通过嵌入反演攻击（EIA）恢复查询文本。

Abstract: Vector Database (VDB) can efficiently index and search high-dimensional
vector embeddings from unstructured data, crucially enabling fast semantic
similarity search essential for modern AI applications like generative AI and
recommendation systems. Since current VDB service providers predominantly use
proprietary black-box models, users are forced to expose raw query text to them
via API in exchange for the vector retrieval services. Consequently, if query
text involves confidential records from finance or healthcare domains, this
mechanism inevitably leads to critical leakage of user's sensitive information.
To address this issue, we introduce STEER (\textbf{S}ecure \textbf{T}ransformed
\textbf{E}mbedding v\textbf{E}ctor\textbf{ R}etrieval), a private vector
retrieval framework that leverages the alignment relationship between the
semantic spaces of different embedding models to derive approximate embeddings
for the query text. STEER performs the retrieval using the approximate
embeddings within the original VDB and requires no modifications to the server
side. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that STEER
effectively safeguards query text privacy while maintaining the retrieval
accuracy. Even though approximate embeddings are approximations of the
embeddings from proprietary models, they still prevent the providers from
recovering the query text through Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs). Extensive
experimental results show that Recall@100 of STEER can basically achieve a
decrease of less than 5\%. Furthermore, even when searching within a text
corpus of millions of entries, STEER achieves a Recall@20 accuracy 20\% higher
than current baselines.

Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models' generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with multiple entities.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces QuaRC, a Quantization-Aware Training framework using coresets for edge devices, which reduces computational cost and improves accuracy, especially with small datasets, by employing relative entropy scoring for coreset selection and cascaded layer correction during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of traditional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices and the performance degradation when using small-scale datasets due to quantization errors.

Method: The paper proposes QuaRC, a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices. It consists of two main phases: coreset selection using ``Relative Entropy Score

Result: QuaRC achieves a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset.

Conclusion: The proposed QuaRC framework achieves significant performance improvements in Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices, especially with small data subsets. For instance, when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: Improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder for semantic communication by capturing common knowledge.

Method: We propose a generative adversarial network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and non-causal representations from the data and design sparse update protocols.

Result: Causality-invariant knowledge ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data. Invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification tasks. Knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder, which surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR.

Conclusion: Causality-invariant knowledge ensures consistency across different devices, has promising performance in classification tasks, and highlights the robustness of the decoder.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Result: the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies across different model architectures.

Conclusion: embedding constraints on the self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Conclusion: 本文全面回顾了双曲神经网络及其在基础模型中的最新发展，并概述了推进该领域关键挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Motivation: 在使用 LLM 根据给定标准对项目进行排名或评估答案时，候选项目的顺序会影响模型的最终决策。这种对 LLM 提示中项目定位的敏感性被称为位置偏差。先前的研究表明，即使在大型模型中也存在这种偏差，尽管其严重程度因模型和任务而异。除了位置偏差之外，LLM 还表现出不同程度的低重复一致性，其中使用相同的候选顺序重复 LLM 调用可能会导致不同的排名。为了解决这两个不一致问题，一种常见的方法是使用不同的候选顺序多次提示模型，并通过多数投票来汇总结果。然而，这种重复策略显着增加了计算成本。

Method: 引入了一种动态提前停止方法，该方法可以自适应地确定每个实例所需的重复次数。

Result: 在三个不同大小的 LLM 和两个任务（即重新排序和对齐）上评估了该方法，结果表明，过渡到动态重复策略可将 LLM 调用次数平均减少 81%，同时保持准确性。与静态重复相比，基于置信度的自适应早期停止方法可将 LLM 调用次数平均减少 87%，相对于原始早期停止方法，只有略微的准确性下降。

Conclusion: 提出了一个动态提前停止方法，自适应地决定每个实例所需的重复次数，与静态重复相比，平均减少了 81% 的 LLM 调用次数，同时保持了准确性。此外，还提出了一种基于置信度的自适应早期停止方法，与静态重复相比，LLM 调用次数平均减少了 87%，相对于原始早期停止方法，只有略微的准确性下降。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality

Method: a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains

Result: CICME reliably detects domain-invariant causal mechanisms and guides the estimation of remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually.

Conclusion: CICME outperforms existing methods by leveraging causal discovery on pooled and individual domain data.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LSDM的流量预测模型，该模型结合了扩散模型和LLM，在预测精度和泛化性方面都优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测方法在不同城市环境中的适应性有限，并且由于个人流量模式的高度不确定性、缺乏详细的环境背景以及不同网络服务之间复杂的依赖关系，导致结果不准确。这些挑战需要能够捕获动态流量分布和丰富的环境特征的先进建模技术。

Method: 提出了一种LLM增强的时空扩散模型 (LSDM)。LSDM 将扩散模型的生成能力与transformers的自适应学习能力相结合，并通过捕获多模态环境信息来建模服务级别模式和动态。

Result: 在真实服务级别数据集上的大量评估表明，该模型在流量使用预测方面表现出色，显示出出色的泛化性和适应性。通过LLM整合上下文信息后，决定系数至少提高 2.83%。与同类型模型（如 CSDI）相比，均方根误差至少可降低 8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM模型在流量预测方面表现出色，具有出色的泛化性和适应性。通过LLM整合上下文信息后，决定系数至少提高 2.83%。与同类型模型（如 CSDI）相比，均方根误差至少可降低 8.29%。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: accurate predictions and robust anomaly detection.

Method: CoCAI leverages a diffusion-based model for forecasting and copula-based modeling for anomaly detection, enhanced by conformal prediction and dimensionality reduction.

Result: High-quality forecasting and statistically grounded anomaly scores, validated on real operational data.

Conclusion: CoCAI demonstrates effectiveness in forecasting target sequences and identifying anomalous segments in real operational data from water distribution and sewerage systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Conclusion: Reasoning models excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise

inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel

Result: 与使用均方误差训练的传统神经网络相比，WGAN生成了具有精细结构的可视化逼真的降水场，即使WGAN在传统评估指标上表现出略低的性能。WGAN的学习评论家与人类感知真实感密切相关。基于案例的分析表明，评论家分数的巨大差异有助于识别不切实际的WGAN输出和参考数据中的潜在伪影。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提高了降水降尺度中的感知真实感，而且为评估和质量控制降水数据集提供了新的视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing methods often fail to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within the network.

Method: a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions.

Result: GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Conclusion: GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Motivation: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design.

Method: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules.

Result: molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules, and can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties.

Conclusion: molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Conclusion: MFNO模型在性能上与基线模型相当或更好，并且比经典数值方案提供更快的样本路径生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Motivation: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data sources.

Method: extend the known lower bounds for public-private learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the two distributions exhibit parameter shift.

Result: when the shift is small (relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made

Conclusion: 该论文验证了SETOL的假设和预测，发现HTSR alpha和SETOL ERG层质量指标在MLP和SOTA NN上表现出惊人的一致性。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Motivation: Robust evaluation of text-to-image models against adversarial attacks is a critical priority, requiring continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts across diverse domains.

Attack success rates are comparable to human-crafted prompts (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16).

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the importance of human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of

Conclusion: UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability for city-wide OD flow predictions.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFTRR 框架通过模仿人类认知过程，解决了现有帖子质量评估方法的局限性，并在实验中取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究存在三个主要局限性：(1) 将任务视为单模态分类，未能利用多模态线索和细粒度的质量区分；(2) 在深度多模态融合过程中引入噪声，导致误导信号；(3) 缺乏捕捉复杂语义关系（如相关性和全面性）的能力。

Method: 多模态细粒度主题-帖子关系推理 (MFTRR) 框架，包含局部-全局语义相关推理模块和多层次证据关系推理模块。

Result: MFTRR 在三个新建的多模态主题-帖子数据集和公共 Lazada-Home 数据集上进行了评估，实验结果表明 MFTRR 显著优于现有技术水平的基线。

Conclusion: MFTRR显著优于现有技术水平的基线，在艺术史数据集上，相对于最佳单模态方法，NDCG@3 提高了 9.52%。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Conclusion: 该研究通过优化数据加载流程、简化GA的前向传递过程来提高计算效率；并结合模型集成策略和基于GeoShapley框架的事后模型解释功能来增强模型的可解释性。实验结果表明，改进后的GA模型在预测精度和推理速度上均优于原始实现，并且能够有效地捕捉到合成数据集中固有的空间效应。

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表格数据集中识别驱动数据偏移的因素对于分析和决策支持系统来说是一个重大的挑战，特别是那些专注于医疗保健的系统。隐私规则限制了数据访问，而来自复杂过程的噪声阻碍了分析。

Method: SIFOTL (用于表格学习的统计知情保真度优化方法)

Result: 对于模仿新的医疗保险药物补贴的 MEPS 面板数据集，SIFOTL 达到了 0.85 的 F1 分数，大大优于 BigQuery 贡献分析 (F1=0.46) 和统计测试 (F1=0.20)。此外，在基于 Synthea ABM 生成的 18 个不同的 EHR 数据集中，SIFOTL 在没有噪声的情况下维持 0.86-0.96 的 F1 分数，即使在注入观测噪声的情况下也 >= 0.75，而基线平均 F1 分数在相同的测试下范围从 0.19-0.67。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释的、注重隐私的工作流程，并且在经验上对观测噪声具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven

Conclusion: The model was evaluated on real-world Copernicus ocean current data and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the

<details>

Motivation: 可穿戴加速度计和陀螺仪包含精细的行为特征，可能被用于重识别用户，因此隐私保护对于医疗保健应用至关重要。

Method: 提出了C-AAE，它结合了匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM）。AAE将原始传感器数据投影到保留活动相关特征并抑制身份信息的潜在空间，ADPCM进一步编码该潜在流，掩盖残余身份信息并缩小比特率。

Result: 在MotionSense和PAMAP2数据集上的实验表明，相对于单独使用AAE，C-AAE将用户重识别的F1分数降低了10-15个百分点，同时保持活动识别的F1分数在未保护基线的5个百分点以内。ADPCM还将数据量减少了大约75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在保持活动识别精度的前提下，显著降低了用户重识别的风险，并有效压缩了数据量，为医疗保健领域中基于传感器的活动识别提供了一条平衡隐私和效用的实用途径。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM通过分阶段混合精度量化，以平均每权重1.6比特的精度有效压缩LLM，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLM）的参数巨大，计算成本高昂，因此部署具有挑战性。超低比特量化可以显著减少存储并加速推理，但极端压缩（即，平均比特宽度<=2）通常会导致严重的性能下降。

Method: Squeeze10-LLM是一个分阶段的混合精度后训练量化（PTQ）框架，通过将80%的权重量化为1比特，20%的权重量化为4比特，实现了平均每权重1.6比特。

Result: Squeeze10-LLM在LLaMA和LLaMA2上的实验表明，其在低于2比特的权重量化方面实现了最先进的性能，在六个零样本分类任务上的平均准确率从43%提高到56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM在低于2比特的权重量化方面实现了最先进的性能，在六个零样本分类任务上的平均准确率从43%提高到56%，与现有的PTQ方法相比有了显著的提升。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 研究了在数据有限的情况下，如何利用额外的监督信息来提高分类模型的准确性。发现关于非硬标签类别的分布信息是最有益的额外监督信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练数据受限的情况下，丰富与每个实例相关的标签信息对于构建高精度分类模型至关重要。通常可以获得硬标签以及额外的监督信息，例如硬标签的置信度。这引发了基本问题：哪些类型的额外监督本质上有益？它们如何提高泛化性能？

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，将硬标签和额外的监督信息视为概率分布，并通过它们的仿射组合构建软标签。通过泛化误差分析，从理论上描述了额外的监督及其混合系数如何影响误差界的收敛速度和渐近值。

Result: 额外的监督信息不是分配的硬标签的置信度，而是关于非硬标签类别的分布信息。额外的监督和混合系数在完善软标签方面起着互补的作用。额外的监督决定了硬标签应调整的方向，而混合系数控制沿该方向的步长。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验表明，额外的监督信息（特别是关于非硬标签类别的分布信息）可以提高分类精度，即使以简单的方式使用。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture, focusing on multiple MVNOs competing for physical resource blocks (PRBs).

Method: The paper proposes Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL).

Result: PDA-DRL achieves a 38% reduction in average delay compared to DRL models optimized for average delay constraints.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a reward-based personalization method for model weight sharing among MVNOs, outperforming traditional aggregation methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for RL systems are often impractical as they modify the environment or policy.

Method: A reward iteration optimization framework using LLMs and a critical state identification algorithm.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in diverse environments.

Conclusion: This paper introduces an adversarial attack method that uses LLMs to generate adversarial rewards, guiding the target policy to make suboptimal actions. A critical state identification algorithm is used to find the agent's most vulnerable states. Experiments show this method outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: systematically investigates robust node classification for class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels, addressing the gap of clean and reliable labels assumption violation in real-world graphs

Method: a novel Graph Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and Pseudo-labeling techniques

Result: produce label-accurate minority nodes to alleviate class imbalance and obtain high-confidence pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio

Conclusion: GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

TL;DR: ChronoSelect uses a four-stage memory architecture to handle noisy labels in deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels in real-world datasets degrade the generalization performance of deep neural networks.

Method: A novel four-stage memory architecture compresses prediction history into temporal distributions with a sliding update mechanism.

Result: ChronoSelect demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect achieves state-of-the-art performance on noisy data.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一个使用异构图的图神经网络，该网络包含交通参与者和矢量化道路网络。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Result: FedSA-GCL outperforms the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis on multiple real-world graph datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed FedSA-GCL method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing an appropriate library of basis functions is a major challenge in SINDy for many dynamical systems.

Method: The study proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), combining sparse regression and a novel library learning strategy with a two-layer optimization architecture.

Result: The SINDy-LOM approach is validated on a diesel engine airpath system, demonstrating its effectiveness on a complex industrial system.

Conclusion: The SINDy-LOM model exhibits good interpretability and usability, yielding a parsimonious model with reduced user burden due to the library optimization mechanism. The RLT perspective enhances the model's reliability compared to traditional SINDy.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM在预测活动和最终结果方面表现优于现有技术，统计增强显著优于随机转换，并提高了数据的可变性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Conclusion: 提出了一种回归感知惩罚来减轻安全回归问题，并调整正同余训练 (PCT) 以在模型无关的方式中保留先前的预测行为。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TIDSIT的新架构，用于更准确地估计电池健康状态，即使在不规则数据下也能表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池在这些系统的效率和安全性中起着核心作用，但由于重复的充放电循环，它们不可避免地会随着时间的推移而退化。这种退化导致能源效率降低和潜在的过热，构成重大的安全问题。因此，准确估计电池的健康状态(SoH)对于确保运行可靠性和安全性至关重要。然而，这些模型难以处理真实测量中固有的不规则性：放电读数通常以非均匀的间隔记录，并且放电循环的长度变化很大。为了解决这个问题，大多数现有方法从序列中提取特征而不是完整地处理它们，这会引入信息丢失并损害准确性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的架构：时间感知动态序列反向Transformer (TIDSIT)。TIDSIT结合了连续时间嵌入来有效地表示不规则采样数据，并利用带有时间注意机制的填充序列来管理可变长度输入，而不会丢弃序列信息。

Result: 在NASA电池退化数据集上的实验结果表明，TIDSIT显著优于现有模型，预测误差降低超过50%，并保持低于0.58%的SoH预测误差。

Conclusion: TIDSIT显著优于现有模型，预测误差降低超过50%，并保持低于0.58%的SoH预测误差。该架构具有通用性，并在涉及不规则时间序列数据的健康监测任务中具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: the empirical success of current model-free MARL algorithms is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning

Method: model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function approximators

Result: co-adapting agents can learn brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents

Conclusion: current MARL environments may not adequately test the core assumptions of Dec-POMDPs

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Motivation: HyperDeepONets improves expressivity but incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large number of output parameters required.

Method: Introduce PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank matrices.

Result: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70% reduction in parameters and consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieves up to 70% reduction in parameters and consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard LLMs, and existing Bayesian and ensemble-based methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper distills uncertainty-aware teacher models into compact student models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and compares softmax-based outputs with Dirichlet-distributed outputs for uncertainty modeling.

Result: Student models achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while requiring only a single forward pass.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

### [192] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HYPER is a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, using multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate flood prediction and water management are critical, but many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill of rainfall-runoff analyses. Achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major challenge.

Method: HYdrological Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is applied to 43 uncalibrated catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear regression to correct errors in the BMA output.

Result: In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median KGE of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55) but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23% of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).

Conclusion: Individual conceptual hydrological models do not necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide range of regions.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

TL;DR: 提出了改进的 bisimulation 度量，以解决传统方法中的问题，并在强化学习任务中实现了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 bisimulation 度量存在两个主要问题：1) 无法表示某些独特的场景；2) 在递归更新期间，依赖于奖励差异和后续状态的预定义权重。

Method: 通过引入状态-动作对的度量，提出了改进的 bisimulation 度量。

Result: 在 DeepMind Control 和 Meta-World 两个代表性基准上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了改进的 bisimulation 度量，具有更精确的奖励差距定义和具有自适应系数的新型更新算子。为提出的度量及其改进的表示独特性提供了收敛的理论保证。在 DeepMind Control 和 Meta-World 两个代表性基准上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generator never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's output through a combination of semantic and structural losses.

Method: a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA

Result: By constraining generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and diversity.

Conclusion: Even minimal class structure is sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [196] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law that unifies various learning algorithms and optimization methods, revealing a common structure underlying these processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences.

Method: a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$.

Result: The force $\mathbf{f}$ drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$ rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables exploration.

Conclusion: This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics, Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPTQ等价于Babai最近平面算法，获得了几何解释和误差保证，为未来量化算法设计奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型语言模型（LLM）的权重从16位量化到更低的位宽，是将大型Transformer部署到更经济的加速器上的事实方法。GPTQ已成为LLM规模上单次训练后量化的标准方法之一。然而，其内部工作原理被描述为一系列临时的代数更新，掩盖了几何意义或最坏情况保证。

Method: 通过复杂的数学论证，证明了GPTQ与Babai最近平面算法在特定条件下的数学等价性。

Result: GPTQ误差传播步骤获得了直观的几何解释，并且GPTQ继承了Babai算法在无剪切条件下的误差上界。

Conclusion: GPTQ在满足无剪切条件时，继承了Babai算法的误差上限，为未来十亿参数模型的量化算法设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.
