However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGIRAM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00POI\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "GIRAM\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u5174\u8da3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u952e\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u751f\u6210\u952e\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5174\u8da3\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGIRAM\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GIRAM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00POI\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroCLIP: \u901a\u8fc7prompt tuning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8111\u7535\u56fe(EEG)\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86zero-shot\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8111\u7535\u56fe-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u751f\u7406-\u7b26\u53f7\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548ctoken\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793atoken\u5230\u8111\u7535\u56fe-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728THINGS-EEG2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeuroCLIP\u5728zero-shot\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523063.2%\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd512.3%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08+4.6% Top-1\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u7684prompt tuning\u5177\u6709\u6865\u63a5\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Classical rank-centric IR metrics (nDCG/MAP/MRR) are a poor fit for RAG, where LLMs consume a set of passages rather than a browsed list; position discounts and prevalence-blind aggregation miss what matters: whether the prompt at cutoff K contains the decisive evidence. Second, there is no standardized, reproducible way to build and audit golden sets. Third, leaderboards exist but lack end-to-end, on-corpus benchmarking that reflects production trade-offs. Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations.

The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u610f\u4e49\u8868\u793a(AMR)\u56fe\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800cASP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6237\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u89e3\u6790AMR\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5730\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-RAR: A retrieval-augmented reasoning framework for complex, multi-step reasoning that mitigates reward hacking and improves response quality.", "motivation": "Existing RAG methods are limited in complex reasoning and lack explicit guidance for intermediate steps, leading to reward hacking and degraded response quality.", "method": "Proposes Bi-RAR, which evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions using a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity.", "result": "Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods on seven question answering benchmarks and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine.", "conclusion": "Bi-RAR is effective for complex reasoning by providing bidirectional evaluation of intermediate steps and optimizing reasoning with multi-objective reinforcement learning."}}

Key tasks in this process, such as schema matching and entity resolution, are essential but often require significant effort. Although previous studies have aimed to automate these tasks, the influence of dataset characteristics on the matching effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined, and combinations of different methods remain limited. This study introduces a contextual graph embedding technique that integrates structural details from tabular data and contextual elements such as column descriptions and external knowledge. Tests conducted on datasets with varying properties such as domain specificity, data size, missing rate, and overlap rate showed that our approach consistently surpassed existing graph-based methods, especially in difficult scenarios such those with a high proportion of numerical values or significant missing data. However, we identified specific failure cases, such as columns that were semantically similar but distinct, which remains a challenge for our method. The study highlights two main insights: (i) contextual embeddings enhance the matching reliability, and (ii) dataset characteristics significantly affect the integration outcomes. These contributions can advance the development of practical data integration systems that can support real-world enterprise applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u5408\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u975e\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6570\u503c\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}
