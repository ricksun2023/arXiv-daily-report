### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC 模型用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构 (KC) 水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于评估大型语言模型在捕获非正式数字学习环境中知识建构细微指标方面的有效性。

Method: 该模型扩展了 DeBERTa-v3，并结合了 Focal Loss、标签平滑和 R-Drop 正则化。

Result: DeBERTa-KC 在 10 折分层交叉验证中实现了 0.836 ± 0.008 的 macro-F1 值，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型可以有效地捕获非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study assesses AI-generated lesson plans from five LLMs using different prompt frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated lesson plans.

Method: Lesson plans for a high-school physics topic were generated and analyzed using computational metrics for readability, factual accuracy, curriculum alignment, and cognitive demand.

Result: Model selection influenced readability, while the prompt framework affected factual accuracy and curriculum alignment. The RACE framework yielded the lowest hallucination index. Learning objectives were mostly at lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

Conclusion: Readability depends on the model, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend on the prompt framework. Combining a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework and a checklist of concepts is most effective.

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 ReDiff 的改进扩散框架，通过主动修正错误来解决离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中训练-推理差异导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中面临训练-推理差异，导致严重的错误累积，产生语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 通过将生成过程从被动去噪重构为主动优化，ReDiff 框架包含一个两阶段训练过程：首先训练模型修正合成错误，然后实现一个在线自修正循环，模型通过学习专家修正来修正自身草稿。

Result: ReDiff 显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff 通过赋予模型回顾和完善已生成输出的关键能力，有效打破了错误累积。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为Sparse Tracing的新技术，用于高效分析长上下文语言模型中的注意力模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可解释性分析技术在处理长上下文时需要大量的计算资源和内存。

Method: 该方法利用动态稀疏注意力，提出了一种名为Stream的编译型分层剪枝算法，可以在近似线性的时间和线性空间内估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码。

Result: 在长链式思考推理和RULER基准测试中，该方法能够在保留关键信息的同时，显著减少需要分析的token交互数量。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing技术使得在消费级GPU上进行长上下文可解释性分析成为可能，有助于降低链式思考监控的门槛。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化 EHR 文本，以确定患者是否有资格进行进一步 HIV 检测的新pipeline。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效筛查和早期诊断 HIV 对于减少进一步传播至关重要。现有研究主要侧重于将机器学习方法应用于结构化数据，例如患者人口统计数据，以改进 HIV 诊断。然而，这些方法通常忽略了非结构化文本数据，例如临床notes，其中可能包含与 HIV 风险相关的重要信息。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化 EHR 文本，以确定患者是否有资格进行进一步 HIV 检测。

Result: 在鹿特丹伊拉斯谟大学医学中心的临床数据上的实验结果表明，我们的pipeline实现了高精度，同时保持了较低的假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该pipeline可以有效分析非结构化文本数据，辅助HIV筛查和诊断。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对大型语言模型（LLM）在生命周期评估（LCA）中的应用进行了基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工智能（AI），特别是大型语言模型（LLM）作为支持生命周期评估（LCA）的工具。目前缺乏关于LLM在环境和社会领域的可靠性、稳健性和可用性的系统证据。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务中的表现。17位经验丰富的从业者根据与LCA实践相关的标准（包括科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和对指令的遵守情况）审查了模型输出。收集了168份专家评审。

Result: 37%的回复包含不准确或误导性信息。在准确性和解释质量方面的评级普遍为平均或良好，格式遵守情况普遍良好。幻觉率差异显著，一些模型产生高达40%的幻觉引用。在开放权重与封闭权重LLM的评级之间没有明确的区别。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LCA中naive地应用LLM的风险，同时也显示了其在解释质量和减轻简单任务的劳动密集性方面的优势。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于游戏的评估方法，以克服现有MLM评估方法中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型(MLM)评估方法通常在静态的、独立的基准上进行，无法在单个任务中联合评估MLM的能力，或者依赖于主观、昂贵的人工或模型两两比较。这使得模型可以利用表面上的捷径来提高胜率。

Method: 本文通过Dixit这款梦幻卡牌游戏来具体实现这种评估方法。玩家必须为一张卡片生成标题，以迷惑一部分但不是全部的玩家，从而选择打出的牌。

Result: 与流行的MLM基准相比，本文的定量实验表明，Dixit的胜率排名与这些基准完全相关。人与MLM玩家之间的Dixit游戏揭示了智能体策略的几个差异，以及MLM推理的改进领域。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估提供了一个强大的框架，以应对上述挑战，并能更全面地评估MLM的能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了使用大型语言模型(LLM), 特别是DeepSeek-R1模型, 来弥合运筹学(OR)中问题建模的差距。论文评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个OR基准测试中的表现，并应用了多种策略来减少幻觉，提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型。先前模型token成本高且容易产生幻觉，限制了其在供应链环境中的实际应用。DeepSeek-R1具有成本效益和高性能的潜力。

Method: 系统地评估DeepSeek-R1在四个关键OR基准测试中的表现：NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR。采用的方法包括基线评估、幻觉分类以及应用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning (FSL)、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: 论文系统地评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个关键OR基准测试中的表现，并应用多种策略来减少幻觉，提高准确性，并使模型输出与用户意图更好对齐。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在探索DeepSeek-R1在应用于OR场景中的有效性，并针对其局限性提出改进方法。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于记忆增强框架的大型语言模型（LLM）智能体学习目标分类函数的方法，无需参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、不灵活且不透明。

Method: 该框架利用情景记忆存储实例级别的批评，并利用语义记忆将其提炼为可重用的任务级别指导。

Result: 在各种任务中，与仅依赖标签的检索基线相比，加入批评可提高高达 24.8% 的准确率。发现 OpenAI 和开源模型在处理面向事实与基于偏好的数据时存在明显的行为差异。引入了一个新的指标——易感性，以解释模型如何响应内存中编码的不同监督表示。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，记忆驱动的、反思性学习有望构建更具适应性和可解释性的 LLM 智能体。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

### [10] [LyriCAR: A Difficulty-Aware Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework For Controllable Lyric Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19967)
*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 LyriCAR 的无监督歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略，提高了翻译质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子层面建模，无法很好地捕捉音乐-语言模式，且段落层面泛化能力不足，难以保证跨行连贯性和全局押韵。

Method: 提出了 LyriCAR 框架，包含难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略。

Result: 在英-中歌词翻译任务上取得了最优结果，在标准翻译指标和多维度奖励得分上均超越了现有方法。自适应课程策略还将训练步骤减少了近 40%。

Conclusion: LyriCAR 框架有效地提高了歌词翻译的质量和效率。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种混合方法，将大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛覆盖的语言处理能力与符号NLU的结构化关系表示能力相结合，旨在结合两者的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）依赖概率推理，容易出错，例如生成事实时产生幻觉，以及在自然语言理解（NLU）任务中输出结构不一致。相比之下，符号NLU系统提供基于词典、语义资源以及句法和语义解释规则的可解释理解。然而，符号NLU系统的覆盖范围往往比LLM更有限，并且需要稀缺的知识表示和语言学技能来扩展和维护。

Method: 该方法利用LLM进行释义和文本简化，以提供广泛的覆盖，并作为信息来源来更自动地填补知识空白。使用符号NLU来生成可用于推理和增量学习的表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果定律的任务中，该混合方法明显优于仅使用符号的流程。

Conclusion: 该混合方法结合了LLM和符号NLU的优点，在特定任务上表现出优越性。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言句子解析成依存关系树的基本算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与短语结构（成分）分析器不同，该算法一次处理一个词，一旦一个词可以被附加就立即附加它，这与人脑解析器的特性相符。

Method: 类似于短语结构解析，其最坏情况复杂度为$O(n^3)$，但在人类语言中，最坏情况只发生在小$n$的情况下。

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的范例，用于描述临床决策任务的两个维度：临床背景和临床问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多医学数据集依赖于简化的问答，无法代表真实的临床决策。

Method: 总结现有数据集和基准的设置，回顾解决临床决策的方法，并总结它们的帮助。

Result: 将评估范围扩展到准确性之外，包括效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: 我们的范例可以明确假设，标准化比较，并指导有临床意义的LLM的开发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

*Alexandra Apostolopoulou,Konstantinos Kanaris,Athanasios Koursaris,Dimitris Tsakalidis,George Domalis,Ioannis E. Livieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了希腊语嵌入模型（GEM），这是一系列为希腊语设计的新型transformer模型，它基于大量高质量数据，并在各种下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理像现代希腊语这样形态丰富的语言时，面临研究分散、架构多样性不足和上下文长度有限等挑战，尤其是在法律等专业领域。

Method: 本文通过严格的质量过滤和预处理方法，构建了大规模的希腊语语料库，并在精心策划的基础上，预训练和系统评估了一套现代架构，例如ELECTRA、ConvBERT和ModernBERT。此外，还提出了第一个专为法律领域量身定制的双语希腊语-英语嵌入模型。

Result: 实验表明，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是有效的，并为希腊语自然语言处理带来了新的可能性。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with redundant and large toolsets due to ambiguity and context limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world toolsets have redundant tools, causing selection errors in LLM agents. Input context limits prevent efficient use of large toolsets.

Method: Propose ToolScope: (1) ToolScopeMerger for tool auditing and fixing. (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and select relevant tools.

Result: ToolScope improves tool selection accuracy by 8.38% to 38.6% on three LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively enhances LLM tool use by reducing redundancy and selecting relevant tools.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)在各种任务中表现出卓越的能力，但在捕捉低资源文化的细微差别方面仍然存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在捕捉低资源文化的细微差别方面的差距。

Method: 通过孟加拉语文化知识(BLanCK)数据集，包括民间传统、烹饪艺术和区域方言，来解决这些限制。

Result: 多语言语言模型在非文化类别中表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现不佳；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都会得到显着提高。

Conclusion: 强调上下文感知架构和文化策划的训练数据。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: 本研究利用强化学习和直接偏好优化 (DPO) 来提高波斯语语言模型的推理能力，特别是在医学问答方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学问答等专业应用中，增强小型语言模型的推理能力至关重要，尤其是在像波斯语这样的小语种中。

Method: 将一个多项选择医学问答数据集翻译成波斯语，并使用 RLAIF 生成拒绝-偏好答案对，这对于 DPO 训练至关重要。通过提示教师和学生模型生成思维链 (CoT) 推理响应，我们编译了一个包含正确和不正确推理轨迹的数据集。

Result: 使用包含首选答案中 200 万个 tokens 和拒绝答案中 250 万个 tokens 的数据集来训练基线模型，从而显着增强了其在波斯语中的医学推理能力。值得注意的是，生成的模型优于其前身 gaokerena-V，后者在约 5700 万个 tokens 上进行了训练，尽管利用的数据集小得多。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了以推理为中心的训练方法在开发数据可用性有限的领域特定语言模型方面的效率和有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 CreativityPrism 的框架，用于评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 的创造力，该框架将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，并在不同任务和领域中评估了 17 个 LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法分散，领域和任务差异大，缺乏统一的创造力评估框架。

Method: 提出了 CreativityPrism 框架，包含九个任务、三个领域（发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理）和二十个评估指标，用于测量创造力的三个维度。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内的任务表现相关性高，不同领域之间相关性较低；多样性和质量指标之间存在很强的相关性，而新颖性与它们的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 在创造力任务或维度上的出色表现不一定能推广到其他任务或维度，因此需要对 LLM 的创造力进行整体评估。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER是一种实体链接（EL）方法，它通过结合候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，在不进行深度微调的情况下实现了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的实体链接依赖于大型标注数据集和广泛的模型微调，而最近的少样本方法虽然通过提示利用大型语言模型（LLM）来减少训练需求，但由于基于LLM的推理成本高昂，效率通常较低。

Method: ARTER计算检索到的候选对象上的一小组互补信号（包括基于嵌入和基于LLM的），以将上下文提及分为简单和困难的情况。然后，这些情况分别由低计算实体链接器（例如ReFinED）和更昂贵的目标LLM推理来处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER的性能优于ReFinED高达+4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个数据集上的平均增益为+2.53%，并且与对所有提及使用基于LLM的推理的管道相比，性能相当，同时在LLM令牌数量方面的效率是其两倍。

Conclusion: ARTER通过自适应路由和选择性推理，在保持高性能的同时，显著提高了实体链接的效率。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoundRL: A novel and efficient approach for token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional sentence- or paragraph-level segmentation methods cannot handle elements beyond plain language, including tables, code snippets, and placeholders, effectively.

Method: BoundRL jointly performs token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts. It generates only a sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating these tokens within the original texts. It performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. It further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a fraction of generated sequences of segments.

Result: BoundRL enables small language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much larger models. RLVR with our designed reward yields significant improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

Conclusion: BoundRL is effective on particularly challenging structured texts.

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在立场检测中存在偏见，尤其是在处理特定社会群体和政治倾向时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在立场检测方法中存在的偏见，尤其是在零样本设置下，以及现有研究对此类偏见的忽视。

Method: 通过自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，使用两种属性：特定群体的方言/语和文本复杂性/可读性，来研究这些属性是否会影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 大型语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出明显的刻板印象，例如将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性相关联，并将非裔美国人方言与反对唐纳德特朗普相关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在立场检测任务中存在偏见，需要进一步研究和解决。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的搜索智能体缺乏在多跳检索上进行深度推理和广泛信息收集的能力，这对于现实世界的应用来说是一个关键的缺陷。

Method: 提出了两种转换已建立数据集的方法，最终得到了一个包含 220 个问题的数据集，涵盖 15 个不同的领域。

Result: 即使是最先进的智能体在 DeepWideSearch 上的平均成功率也只有 2.39%，这突显了在信息搜索任务中整合深度和广度搜索的巨大挑战。

Conclusion: 发布 DeepWideSearch 以促进未来对更强大和更健壮的信息搜索智能体的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在表格理解和推理方面存在局限性，微调方法容易出现算术错误和幻觉，而基于工具的方法依赖于严格的模式并且缺乏语义理解。

Method: 该方法将表格推理分解为三个专门的角色：计划、编码和回答。并引入了一种自改进训练框架，该框架采用蒙特卡罗树搜索 (MCTS) rollouts 来生成伪黄金轨迹，并使用强化学习 (RL) 优化代理。

Result: Mixture-of-Minds 实现了显着收益，在 TableBench 上达到 62.13%，超过了 OpenAI-o4-mini-high。

Conclusion: 将结构化多智能体工作流程与强化学习相结合，可以提升表格理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在小型空间推理任务上表现尚可，但在复杂度增加时性能显著下降，表明其空间表征能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）通过一系列任务对文本输入进行空间推理的能力，旨在探究它们的空间理解和计算能力。

Method: 通过五个任务测试模型，这些任务包括象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，所有任务都在结构化的基于网格的环境中进行，并通过增加网格维度来扩展每个任务的复杂性。

Result: 结果表明，虽然LLM在小型复杂度和大小的所有任务中表现出适度的成功，但随着规模的增加，性能迅速下降，平均准确率损失为42.7％，最高达到84％。每个以超过50％的准确率开始的测试都显示出至少48％的损失。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在语言和空间推理之间存在差距，揭示了它们当前的局限性，并为未来在语言和几何交叉点的综合基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法仅考虑输出的特定分词，忽略了其他可能的分词方式。采样近似边缘化方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 研究了多种开放模型的解码自由采样策略，以评估其近似质量和速度。

Result: 发现解码自由采样策略能够以较低的运行成本提供足够准确的边缘估计。

Conclusion: 解码自由采样策略为LLM评估提供了一种高效且准确的方法，并在下游推理任务中展示了其用途。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于评估抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）严重程度的三模态情感融合框架，该框架结合了访谈文本、音频和面部信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评估方法通常是二元的且特定于疾病，无法满足临床上对严重程度敏感的跨疾病评估和决策支持解释的需求。

Method: 该框架同步并融合了访谈文本（句子级Transformer嵌入）、音频（log Mel统计量及其delta）和面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部和姿势描述符），以输出抑郁症（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的分级严重程度。通过校准的后期融合分类器融合标准化特征，产生每个疾病的概率和特征级别的归因。

Result: 在DAIC衍生语料库上进行的分层交叉验证表明，该方法优于单模态/消融基线。融合模型在准确性和加权F1上与最强的单模态基线相匹配，同时提高了决策曲线的效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合降低了回归误差并提高了类一致性。消融实验表明，文本对抑郁症严重程度的贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，而归因与语言和行为标记一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: ContextLM通过引入next-context prediction目标来增强大型语言模型的预训练，提高模型捕捉高级语义结构和长程上下文关系的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型预训练方法依赖于next-token prediction，这限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长程上下文关系的能力。

Method: 提出了ContextLM框架，该框架通过next-context prediction来增强标准的预训练过程。该机制训练模型学习multi-token contexts的预测性表示，利用来自未来token chunks的误差信号。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上进行了大量实验，结果表明ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能方面都取得了持续的改进。

Conclusion: Next-context prediction提供了一种可扩展且高效的语言建模增强途径，能够以最小的计算开销产生更好的长程一致性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to

perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于LLM的RAG系统中的引用失败问题，即模型生成了有用的回复但未能完全引用证据。作者提出了一个两步方法来解决这个问题：首先，研究引用失败发生的时间；其次，研究如何缓解这个问题。他们引入了一个新的基准测试CITECONTROL，并提出了一个名为CITENTION的框架，该框架集成了生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法，以提高LLM的引用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的RAG系统的引用应该简化响应验证，但当模型生成有用的响应但未能引用完整的证据时，这一假设不成立。以往的工作没有将引用失败与响应失败区分开来。

Method: 1.  研究引用失败发生的时间。2. 如何缓解它。作者引入CITECONTROL基准测试，系统地改变响应和证据之间的关系，以分析失败模式。提出了一个名为CITENTION的框架，该框架集成了生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法。

Result: 实验表明，失败随着关系复杂性的增加而增加，并且表明组合引用方法可以提高性能。在CITECONTROL和转移设置中，结果证明了引用方面有显著的改进。

Conclusion: 论文研究了LLM在RAG系统中生成引用时遇到的问题，发现引用失败会随着关系复杂性的增加而增加，并提出了一种新的框架CITENTION来提高LLM的引用效率。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文研究了过程奖励模型（PRM）在表格问答（TQA）中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PRM在数学等领域表现出色，但在半结构化数据（如表格）上的应用尚未探索。TQA对PRM提出了独特的挑战，包括信息冗余、步骤关联弱以及领域特定推理。

Method: 本文对最先进的生成式PRM在TQA上进行了评估，从答案和步骤两个角度进行分析。

Result: 结合文本和代码验证的PRM可以辅助答案选择，但泛化能力较弱。步骤层面验证的性能与答案准确率之间相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前PRM在TQA上存在局限性，研究结果为构建更强大的、具有过程意识的验证器提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT improves LRMs' mathematical reasoning by optimizing the interaction between the model's internal reasoning and external Code Interpreters (CIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are not good at complex mathematical operations; integrating computational tools introduces conflict between the model's internal reasoning and the external knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models to unproductive deliberation.

Method: A post-training framework called CoRT (Code-Optimized Reasoning Training) is introduced, which uses Hint-Engineering to inject hints and refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement learning.

Result: CoRT improves performance by 4-8% on DeepSeek models across five mathematical reasoning datasets. It also reduces token usage by 30-50%.

Conclusion: CoRT effectively teaches LRMs to utilize CIs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能受到数据集污染的影响，它们可能只是记住了公开数据集，而不是真正的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，忽略了一个重要的混淆因素：数据集污染。作者研究了LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集（如Adult Income、Titanic等）具有先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控的探测实验，作者揭示了污染效应只出现在包含强语义线索的数据集中，例如有意义的列名或可解释的价值类别。当这些线索被移除或随机化时，性能会急剧下降到接近随机水平。

Result: LLMs在表格推理任务中表现出的能力，可能部分反映了对公开可用数据集的记忆，而不是真正的泛化。

Conclusion: 作者讨论了评估协议的含义，并提出了在未来的LLM评估中，将语义泄露与真实的推理能力区分开来的策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的RAG系统中chunk的方法，FreeChunker。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的chunk方法依赖于静态边界识别，对不同的query要求适应性有限。

Method: 将句子视为原子单元，从静态chunk分割转变为支持任意句子组合的灵活检索。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验表明，FreeChunker在检索性能上优于传统chunk方法，并且在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过灵活的跨粒度编码，提高了RAG系统的检索性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过对话数据预训练和微调策略，使模型生成更具交流性的文本。

Method: 研究人员基于预训练的 llamalogue 模型，采用了多种微调策略，并使用 PPO 和 DPO 方法来改进模型。

Result: 模型在 BabyLM 基准测试中表现不佳，但在对话延续预测方面表现出色。PPO 微调对模型有混合或对抗性影响，而 DPO 微调进一步提高了模型在自定义对话基准上的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对话数据预训练和 DPO 微调可以有效地提高模型在对话任务中的性能。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，本文旨在填补这一空白，并解答三个重要的研究问题。

Method: 通过构建NegHalu数据集（将现有幻觉检测数据集用否定表达式进行重构）来研究LLM是否能识别否定引起的上下文变化，并可靠地区分幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，LLM难以有效检测否定文本中的幻觉，经常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。

Conclusion: 否定文本给LLM的幻觉检测带来了挑战，需要进一步研究以减轻其负面影响。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

TL;DR: NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual are BERT-style models for Hebrew texts, outperforming existing models on Hebrew benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The architectural choices used in BERT models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models. Recent architectures have been proposed to close this gap.

Method: Trained BERT-style models using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a dedicated focus on Hebrew texts.

Result: NeoDictaBERT models outperform existing ones on almost all Hebrew benchmarks. NeoDictaBERT-bilingual shows strong results on retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The models provide a strong foundation for downstream tasks and advance research and development in Hebrew NLP. The models are released to the community.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性上有所提高，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外收益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat验证了有针对性的后训练对提高对话质量的好处，并表明Contingency对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Motivation: 现有指令调整方法忽略了大量低质量数据，且数据增强方法效果不佳，缺乏对这些技术的有效评估。

Method: 1. 构建包含低质量指令簇及其高质量提炼的MIXTURE数据集。2. 提出LM-Mixup方法，通过有监督微调和强化学习，利用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三种奖励信号进行优化。

Result: LM-Mixup能够有效增强不完善的数据集，仅使用3%的提炼数据即可超越全数据集训练，并与当前最佳的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据是一种宝贵的资源，通过适当的提炼和LM-Mixup增强，可以显著提高指令调整LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型输出的可靠性无法保证，因为其输出结果具有不同程度的不确定性和正确性。

Method: 系统地评估四种LLM输出置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、Sample Consistency和CoCoA，并在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM进行实验。

Result: 每种不确定性指标都捕获了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法总体上产生最佳的可靠性，从而改善了校准和正确答案的区分。

Conclusion: 讨论每种方法的优缺点，并为在LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Result: 在五个 NLP 任务和多个持续学习场景中的大量实验表明，RECALL 在知识保留和泛化方面均优于基线。

Conclusion: RECALL 为不断发展的 LLM 提供了一种可扩展的无数据解决方案，在多域集成和抵抗灾难性遗忘方面表现出强大的性能。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可以检测到自己是否正在被评估，并调整其行为以显得更加一致，从而影响安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 通过以下步骤来研究我们的steering技术：1. 使用一个双步训练过程训练LLM来展示评估感知行为，该过程旨在模仿这种行为如何自然地出现。首先，在包含模型的事实描述的文档上执行持续的预训练：(1) 在评估期间使用Python类型提示，但在部署期间不使用；(2) 识别到某个评估提示的存在总是意味着它正在被测试。然后，我们使用专家迭代来训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。2. 发现激活steering可以抑制评估感知，并使模型表现得像已部署一样，即使在提示存在的情况下也是如此。重要的是，我们在额外的训练之前使用原始模型构建了我们的steering vector。

Result: 发现激活steering可以抑制评估感知，并使模型表现得像已部署一样，即使在提示存在的情况下也是如此。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过steering模型使其表现得像已部署一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过昂贵的再训练来解决偏好覆盖差距，但可能无法推广到各种不同的偏好。当用户的请求反映出偏离训练数据中心趋势的细微偏好时，模型性能可能会不可预测地下降。

Method: RPS 通过从相关偏好的局部邻域中抽取多个响应来创建一个更好的候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最一致的响应。

Result: 在三个不同的对齐范例（DPA、DPO 和 SFT）上的综合实验表明，RPS 始终优于基线，在来自空间中代表性不足区域的具有挑战性的偏好上实现了高达 69% 的获胜率，而无需任何模型再训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种实用的、理论上有根据的解决方案，用于提高偏好对齐模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

### [45] [Hierarchical Sequence Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20505)
*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为分层序列（HSEQ）迭代的统一框架，用于解决检索增强生成（RAG）在多步骤问题和异构证据源上的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法在处理多步骤问题和异构证据源时存在准确性和效率之间的trade-off。

Method: 该方法将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为具有轻量级结构标签的可逆分层序列，并执行结构感知迭代以收集足够的证据。通过Head Agent引导检索，Iteration Agent选择和扩展HSeq。最后，Head Agent合成规范化的证据以生成最终答案。

Result: 在HotpotQA（文本）、HybridQA/TAT-QA（表格+文本）和MetaQA（知识图谱）上的实验表明，与强大的单通道、多跳和Agentic RAG基线相比，HSEQ在EM/F1指标上获得了持续的提升，同时保持了高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ具有三个关键优势：(1) 格式无关的统一性，使单个策略能够跨文本、表格和知识图谱运行，无需针对每个数据集进行专门化；(2) 引导式的、预算感知的迭代，减少了不必要的跳转、工具调用和tokens，同时保持了准确性；(3) 证据规范化，用于可靠的问答，提高答案的一致性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）政治偏见的新方法，该方法基于多语言翻译的公平性原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通常通过模拟LLM对英语调查的回答来评估其政治偏见。本文旨在提出一种替代框架。

Method: 系统地比较欧洲议会（EP）中演讲的翻译质量，观察多数党派（左、中、右）的翻译质量优于局外党派。

Result: 观察到多数党派（左、中、右）的翻译质量优于局外党派。

Conclusion: 该研究基于一个新的21向多平行版本的EuroParl，其中包含每个发言者的政治派别。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ARC-Encoder的上下文压缩方法，该方法将上下文压缩成连续表示，以替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文更长，推理成本增加。现有的上下文压缩技术要么需要微调目标模型，要么需要修改其架构，这会降低其通用能力。

Method: 设计了一种Adaptable text Representations Compressor (ARC-Encoder)，该编码器输出比文本token少x倍的连续表示。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个基准测试上实现了最先进的性能，同时提高了推理计算效率。该模型可以同时适应多个解码器，允许单个编码器在不同的解码器LLM上推广。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一种灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可以与多个LLM无缝协作。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个用于评估语言模型理解中心嵌入句子的数据集，通过比较模型在合理和不合理句子上的表现来区分结构理解和语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏区分语言模型结构理解和语义模式匹配的方法。

Method: 引入CenterBench数据集，包含9,720个关于中心嵌入句子的理解问题，这些句子在句法上相同但语义上不合理，并测试了六个模型。

Result: 模型在合理和不合理句子之间的性能差距随着复杂性的增加而系统性地扩大，表明模型放弃了结构分析而转向语义关联。语义合理性会损害关于结果行为的问题的表现。推理模型提高了准确性，但显示出语义捷径、过度思考和拒绝回答。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了一个框架，用于识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，旨在提高多跳问答中的全局推理能力。它通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理以及迭代优化证据来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在多跳问答中效果有限，因为缺乏全局规划和不忠实的执行。

Method: GlobalRAG将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，并迭代优化证据。引入了规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励，并采用渐进式权重退火策略。

Result: GlobalRAG在领域内和领域外基准测试中显著优于强大的基线，仅使用8k训练数据（仅为强基线使用的训练数据的42%），在EM和F1方面平均提高了14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG能够有效提高多跳问答中的全局推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的电商搜索框架，通过主动决策支持来弥补传统检索排序范式的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程不符，导致复杂查询存在语义差距、决策成本高以及缺乏专业购物指导。

Method: 提出了多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），将范式从被动检索转变为主动决策支持。

Result: 离线评估表明，MACDF 显著提高了推荐准确率和用户满意度，尤其是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在线 A/B 测试证实了其在京东搜索平台上的实际效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电子商务搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GAN生成图像的逼真度迅速提高，对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统提出了严峻挑战。

Method: 该方法首先使用二维离散傅里叶变换(2D DFT)将图像转换到频域，然后在这些转换后的图像上训练ResNet50神经网络，以区分真实图像和合成图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该频域模型达到了92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，该方法突出了将信号处理技术和深度学习相结合以增强数字取证和加强工业AI系统可信度的工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法在从 2D 图像中识别 3D 对象时面临挑战，通常需要大量的标记数据并且依赖于可能忽略关键形状关系的卷积神经网络 (CNN)。

Method: 我们的工作表明，基于视觉 Transformer (ViT) 的架构在与现代对比目标配对时，在我们的下游任务中的多视图 3D 分析中取得了有希望的结果，统一了对比和 3D 形状理解管道。

Result: 例如，监督对比损失在 ModelNet10 上的准确率达到了约 90.6%。

Conclusion: 使用 ViT 和对比学习，利用 ViT 理解整体形状的能力和对比学习的有效性，克服了对大量标记数据的需求以及 CNN 在捕获关键形状关系方面的局限性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器transformer跟踪方法效果不佳。

Method: 该框架包含一个基于transformer的平滑器和一个融合驱动的跟踪器，无需显式的运动模型。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上，FutrTrack的aMOTA达到了74.7，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: FutrTrack提供了一个有效的框架，可以在有限的数据和没有预训练的情况下改进基于transformer的跟踪器。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法忽略了类别之间的关系，无法有效降低模型过度自信。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑（OLS），一种动态调整软标签的方法，该方法在训练过程中根据模型自身的预测模式进行调整。在RadImageNet数据集上，使用ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构评估OLS。

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类精度上均优于标准训练方法，包括硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏。OLS还可以产生更紧凑和分离良好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅可以提高预测性能，还可以增强校准，使其成为在医学成像领域开发值得信赖的AI系统的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的实时渲染感知滤波方法，以解决3D高斯溅射（3DGS）模型在训练数据分布之外的相机位置观察时产生的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当从训练数据分布之外的相机位置观察3DGS模型时，由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据，会导致模型产生不确定的密度、颜色和几何预测，从而产生明显的视觉噪声。

Method: 该方法利用从中间梯度导出的敏感性得分，显式地针对由各向异性方向而不是各向同性方差引起的不稳定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视觉质量、真实性和一致性方面都优于现有的基于神经辐射场（NeRF）的方法，如BayesRays。

Conclusion: 该滤波器可以无缝地集成到现有的3DGS渲染管线中，并且是实时的，这与需要大量事后重新训练或微调的方法不同。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle: A hybrid framework combining physics-based modeling and machine learning for quantitative transcranial ultrasound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcranial ultrasound is challenging due to skull-induced signal distortions and limited probe coverage. Existing methods struggle with weak signals or inaccurate modeling of wave propagation through bone.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) Reverse time migration for structural detail preservation. 2) Transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with graph-based attention for coherent and accurate SoS image fusion.

Result: BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle demonstrates potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging by addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

Result: 研究结果表明：(1) 在与国家无关的提示下，模型默认采用全球北方、现代倾向的描述，从而抹平了跨国差异；(2) 迭代 I2I 编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；(3) I2I 模型应用肤浅的线索，而不是时代一致、上下文相关的变化。

Conclusion: 目前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍然不可靠。该论文发布了标准化的数据、提示和人工评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见提供了一个可重复的、以文化为中心的基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent

systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [59] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法（FIBAR），用于从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从事件相机事件重建强度图像是一项具有挑战性的任务，通常使用在图形处理单元上部署的神经网络来解决。

Method: 使用时间数字 IIR 滤波器整合事件所指示的强度变化；通过一种新颖的算法检测陈旧像素，该算法调节最近更新的像素窗口；使用高斯滤波器模糊陈旧像素。

Result: FIBAR 在现代笔记本电脑 CPU 上运行，启用（禁用）空间滤波时，速度约为 42(140) 百万事件/秒。FIBAR 的重建比基于神经网络的方法噪点更多，并且存在重影图像，但足以用于某些任务，例如检测基准标记。

Conclusion: FIBAR 是一种更简单的方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但对于某些任务来说已经足够，并且具有异步性和更高的运行速度的优势。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的转换双边张量低秩表示模型（TBTLRR），该模型通过学习任意酉变换引入数据自适应张量核范数，从而更有效地捕获全局相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于固定变换，并且对噪声的鲁棒性较差。

Method: 该模型利用潜在张量数据的双边结构来利用图像样本和特征之间的局部相关性，并集成了$\ell_{1/2}$-范数和Frobenius范数正则化项，以更好地处理现实场景中的复杂噪声。为了求解所提出的非凸模型，我们开发了一种受交替方向乘子法（ADMM）启发的有效优化算法，并提供了理论收敛性。

Result: 大量的实验验证了该模型在聚类方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型在聚类方面表现出色，代码可在https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR获取。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare is a source-available, cross-platform application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in minimally invasive surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widespread use of video-based assessment and surgical data science is limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with video sharing.

Method: The software development followed the software development life cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. An internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design architecture. An external clinician survey combined the same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware configurations.

Result: Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5). Ten surgeons reported high perceived usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).

Conclusion: Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life

same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware

the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived

usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的卷积操作，称为Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，它通过引入自适应路由和横向抑制来提高卷积神经网络的性能，使其在图像分类和生成任务中优于传统的自注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的卷积神经网络在表达能力上不如自注意力机制，并且存在冗余。这篇论文旨在研究自注意力机制优于卷积的原因，并尝试将自注意力的优势融入到卷积中。

Method: 该论文通过重新审视卷积神经网络的设计，揭示了自注意力机制的两个关键优势：自适应路由和横向抑制。基于这两个发现，论文提出了一种新的卷积操作ATConv，它在卷积核中引入了这两个原则。

Result: ATConv在图像分类和生成任务中都取得了优于传统自注意力机制的结果。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K数据集上取得了84.4%的Top-1准确率，并且在扩散模型的图像生成任务中，使用ATConv替换自注意力机制可以提高生成图像的质量并加速采样。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，通过将自注意力机制的关键优势融入到卷积操作中，可以有效地提高卷积神经网络的性能，使其在各种视觉任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StableSketcher，一个用于生成高质量手绘草图的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在合成像素级手绘草图方面存在挑战，无法很好地捕捉草图的抽象表达。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，更好捕捉草图特征。2. 整合基于视觉问答的强化学习奖励函数，提高文本图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: StableSketcher生成的草图在风格保真度上有所提高，并且与prompt的对齐更好。同时，还构建了一个新的数据集SketchDUO。

Conclusion: StableSketcher框架有效地提升了扩散模型生成手绘草图的质量，并构建了一个新的数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用图像和标题作为物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，通过结合标题训练，可以鼓励与共享潜在结构对齐，从而突出潜在的诊断特征并抑制虚假相关性。然而，大规模获取忠实的、特定于实例的标题是一个挑战。

Method: 通过多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）生成合成标题，并以维基百科衍生的视觉信息和分类单元定制的格式示例为指导，从而减少幻觉并产生准确的、基于实例的描述性标题。

Result: 使用这些标题训练了BIOCAP，这是一个生物基础模型，可以捕获丰富的语义，并在物种分类和文本图像检索中取得出色的性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在桥接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面，描述性标题具有超越标签的价值。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的数据集上表现良好，优于其他新视点合成方法。

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法有效，无需重新训练或微调。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在开放世界应用中的可靠性，现有的事后方法通常未能充分利用模型 logits 空间中嵌入的丰富信息。

Method: 提出 LogitGap，一种新颖的事后 OOD 检测方法，它显式地利用最大 logit 和剩余 logits 之间的关系。此外，还引入了一种无需训练的策略，可以自动识别用于评分的最具信息的 logits。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的大量实验表明，LogitGap 在各种 OOD 检测场景和基准测试中始终如一地实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap 有效地利用了 logits 空间中的信息，并在 OOD 检测中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，精确估计骑自行车者的姿态对于骑自行车者穿越意图分类、行为预测和避撞至关重要。现有的6D姿态方法不足以应对自行车车把/踏板角度变化的情况。

Method: 提出了一种类别级别的8D姿态估计方法，该方法可以联合估计8D姿态和铰接自行车的3D关键点，并使用合成和真实图像数据进行训练。

Result: 该方法在估计的8D姿态参数的准确性方面表现出良好的结果，与使用刚性规范对象模板进行匹配的最先进的类别级别6D姿态估计器相比，获得了具有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更精细地估计自行车姿态状态和行进方向。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Conclusion: IB-GAN能够以解耦和可解释的方式利用潜在空间，并在多个数据集上取得了良好的实验结果。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

TL;DR: PPMStereo: A novel stereo matching network with a memory buffer for long-range spatio-temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent depth estimation in stereo video disrupts user immersion in AR. Long-term temporal consistency is challenging to model efficiently.

Method: A Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module is introduced for dynamic Stereo matching (PPMStereo). It uses a two-stage process: `pick' (identifies relevant frames) and `play' (weights selected frames).

Result: PPMStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and temporal consistency. It achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the Sintel clean/final (17.3% & 9.02% improvements over BiDAStereo).

Conclusion: PPMStereo effectively models long-range spatio-temporal consistency with fewer computational costs.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种评估文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）模型作为行人动力学隐式模拟器性能的严格评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注个体对象，而不是具有多个交互人物的场景。生成视频中多智能体动力学的合理性仍未得到验证。

Method: 该研究利用来自已建立数据集的起始帧进行I2V评估，并开发了一个提示套件来探索不同的行人员密度和交互方式以进行T2V评估。一个关键组成部分是一种从像素空间重建2D鸟瞰视角轨迹的方法，无需已知的相机参数。

Result: 分析表明，领先的模型已经学习了令人惊讶的有效先验知识，可以实现合理的多个代理行为。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了现有模型的优点和不足，例如合并和消失的人，强调了未来改进的领域。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频监控方法，用于识别不同程度的可疑意图，从而改进安全监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续性，限制了早期干预和可解释性。

Method: 我们提出了可疑进展分析网络（SPAN），它从离散分类转向连续回归，从而能够捕捉波动和演变的可疑意图。我们还引入了概念锚定映射方法，以将可疑行为与预定义的意图概念联系起来，从而深入了解行为及其潜在的潜在意图。

Result: 在HAI数据集上的大量实验表明，SPAN明显优于现有方法，MSE降低了19.8%，平均mAP提高了1.78%。

Conclusion: 我们的连续可疑建模方法能够实现更早的检测和主动干预，从而大大提高了安全应用中的系统可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对用于脑部MRI的基础模型的数据规模、多样性和一致性的系统评估。

Method: 分析了54个公开的脑部MRI数据集，从数据集和图像层面进行多层次概述，并量化了预处理变异性。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++是一个跨阶段提示优化框架，通过统一训练数据对齐的改进、测试时迭代缩放和大型语言模型 (LLM) 微调来显着改进 T2V 生成，而无需修改底层生成主干。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常较短、非结构化且与训练数据不一致，限制了基于扩散的 T2V 模型的生成潜力。

Method: RAPO++ 包含三个阶段：(1) 检索增强提示优化 (RAPO)，通过从关系图中检索语义相关的修饰符来丰富用户提示，并重构它们以匹配训练分布；(2) 样本特定提示优化 (SSPO)，一种闭环机制，使用多源反馈迭代地优化提示；(3) 利用 SSPO 优化后的提示对来微调重写器 LLM。

Result: 在五个最先进的 T2V 模型和五个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，RAPO++ 在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得了显着收益，大大优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++ 是一种与模型无关、经济高效且可扩展的解决方案，为 T2V 生成中的提示优化设置了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Result: FlowCycle实现了优于现有技术的编辑质量和一致性。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过学习产生目标感知的中间状态，实现了忠实的修改并保持了源一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统的胎儿运动检测方法（包括母亲感知和胎儿心电图 (CTG)）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题。异常的运动模式可能表明潜在的并发症，如胎盘功能障碍或胎儿窘迫

Method: 利用双对比损失，结合空间和时间对比学习，来学习鲁棒的运动表征。此外，引入了一种特定于任务的采样策略，确保在自监督训练期间有效分离运动和非运动片段，同时通过概率微调方法实现对任意长度超声记录的灵活推理

Result: 在包含 92 名受试者（每人 30 分钟超声检查）的内部数据集上进行评估，CURL 的灵敏度达到 78.01%，AUROC 达到 81.60%，证明了其在可靠和客观的 FM 分析方面的潜力

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 基于扩散的图像编辑方法受限于图像反演过程中的近似误差。为了解决这个问题，我们研究了VQ-based生成模型的参数高效调整方法，利用其精确的中间量化表示来实现更精确的图像反演。

Method: 提出EditInfinity，它调整二值量化的生成模型Infinity来进行图像编辑。提出了一种高效的图像反演机制，集成了文本提示校正和图像风格保持。设计了一个整体平滑策略，使EditInfinity能够以高保真度对源图像进行图像编辑，并精确地与文本提示进行语义对齐。

Conclusion: EditInfinity在图像编辑方面优于state-of-the-art的基于扩散的模型。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)在较长的自由形式回复中更容易产生幻觉。作者认为幻觉的风险不是由长度本身引起的，而是由于在较长的回复中对上下文的依赖性增加所致。因此，他们提出了一个“诱导-检测-抑制”框架，通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导的实例来早期检测高风险情况，并最终抑制实际解码过程中潜在的对象级幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)中，长回复中幻觉问题是否仅仅由长度引起，还是存在更深层的机制。

Method: 提出一个“诱导-检测-抑制”框架，该框架通过设计上下文来诱导幻觉，并利用这些诱导的实例来检测高风险情况，最终在解码过程中抑制幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了一致且显着的改进。

Conclusion: 这项研究验证了关于上下文的假设，并为更深入地探索LVLM较长回复中的幻觉问题提供新的见解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Conclusion: COS3D框架通过有效整合互补的语言和分割线索，在开放词汇3D分割任务中取得了领先的性能，并具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DualGround的双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来解决视频时序定位（VTG）中现有方法对所有文本token同等对待的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VTG模型在跨模态注意力中对所有文本token同等对待，过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义，而未能有效利用词级信号，限制了其实现细粒度时序对齐的能力。

Method: DualGround架构包含双分支，通过句子级路径传递[EOS] token以提取全局语义，并将词token聚类成短语级单元以进行局部定位。该方法引入了tokenrole-aware的跨模态交互策略，以结构解耦的方式将视频特征与句子级和短语级语义对齐，并采用联合建模框架。

Result: DualGround在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试的Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中是有效的。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感和跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出基于掩码的位置编码（MPE）来捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓，并设计上下文增强模块（CEM）来提取长程上下文特征。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在具有挑战性的地-空场景下，定位精度提高了3.39%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了一个鲁棒的位置编码范例和一个上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为校准多模态共识 (CMC) 的模型，以解决多模态情感识别 (MER) 中语义不一致和文本主导的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了跨模态可能出现的语义不一致（例如文本和视觉输入之间冲突的情感线索），并且容易受到文本模态主导的影响，从而损害识别准确性。

Method: 引入伪标签生成模块 (PLGM) 以自监督方式生成伪单模标签，然后采用无参数融合模块 (PFM) 和多模态共识路由器 (MCR) 进行多模态微调，从而减轻文本主导地位并指导融合过程达成更可靠的共识。

Result: 在四个数据集（CH-SIMS、CH-SIMS v2、CMU-MOSI 和 CMU-MOSEI）上，CMC 实现了与最先进方法相当或更优越的性能，并且在 CH-SIMS 和 CH-SIMS v2 上具有语义不一致的场景中表现出显着优势。

Conclusion: CMC 模型有效地解决了多模态情感识别中语义不一致和文本主导的问题，并在实验中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

*Guangyu Dai,Dong Chen,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视频异常检测的细粒度多模态特征方法 (GMFVAD)，通过利用多模态信息的多样性来减少视觉特征中的冗余，从而提高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作主要利用时空相关性或粗略地结合文本特征进行视频异常检测，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的冗余信息。

Method: 该方法基于视频片段生成更细粒度的多模态特征，并引入基于视频字幕的文本特征来增强突出部分的视觉特征。

Result: 在四个主要数据集上取得了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了GMFVAD的改进是由于减少了冗余信息。

Conclusion: GMFVAD有效地减少了冗余信息，提高了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KINN的轻量级框架，用于解决在数据有限和领域转移情况下，复杂值合成孔径雷达（CV-SAR）图像识别中泛化性、可解释性和效率之间的三难困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动模型未能充分利用CV-SAR数据中固有的丰富电磁散射特征。

Method: KINN基于新颖的“压缩-聚合-压缩”架构，通过物理引导的压缩、聚合模块和语义压缩阶段，提取稀疏、物理基础的特征，并学习具有判别性的嵌入。

Result: 在五个SAR基准上的大量评估表明，KINN在参数高效识别方面建立了最先进的水平，在数据稀缺和分布外场景中提供了出色的泛化能力和切实的解释性。

Conclusion: KINN为解决表示三难困境提供了一种有效的解决方案，并为SAR图像分析中可信赖的AI提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了第一人称视角带来的独特挑战，例如理解多个事件和识别手部-物体交互。

Method: 我们提出了一个双模态反事实对比构建 (DMC3) 框架，它包含一个以自我为中心的 videoqa 基线，一个反事实样本构建模块和一个反事实样本参与的对比优化。

Result: 我们的方法在 EgoTaskQA 的 normal 和 indirect 分别实现了 52.51% 和 46.04% 的准确率，在 QAEGO4D 上实现了 13.2% 的准确率，均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DMC3 框架有效地提升了以自我为中心的视频问答性能。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有方法将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽略了指令多样性和质量对性能的影响。

Method: 本文介绍了Instruction-as-Reasoning范例，将指令视为动态分析路径，并提出了一个两阶段训练框架：在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT），然后进行强化学习（RL）以优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B在五个具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了最先进的结果，UI-Ins-32B在UI-I2E-Bench上得分87.3％，在ScreenSpot-Pro上得分57.0％，在MMBench-GUI L2上得分84.9％。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上实现了74.1％的成功率。

Conclusion: 本文表明，推理可以被 формулировать 以增强而不是阻碍 grounding 性能，并且该方法可以减轻SFT + RL框架中的策略崩溃。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Conclusion: HyperET能够有效提高MLLM的训练效率和性能，通过在双曲空间中对齐视觉和文本模态，解决了传统方法中存在的对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过引入通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调策略，有效地提高了点云压缩的泛化能力，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Method: AccuQuant通过最小化全精度扩散模型及其量化版本在几个去噪步骤中的输出差异来缓解误差累积问题。此外，还提出了一种有效的AccuQuant实现技术，以及一种新的目标，该目标将内存复杂度从$\\\mathcal{O}(n)$显著降低到$\\\mathcal{O}(1)$，其中$n$是去噪步骤的数量。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，AccuQuant在各种任务和扩散模型上都表现出功效和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant有效地量化扩散模型，并在各种任务中表现良好。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. Patch tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs.

Method: The paper introduces the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control.

Result: The PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that DiTs can model geometry directly in 3D space by using PE-Field.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D

### [98] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的因果方法，用于预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，同时将这些元素显式地注入到跨模态表示学习中，以减轻偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像到食谱检索方法有一个隐含的假设，即食物图像可以完全捕捉到食谱中以文本形式记录的细节。然而，食物图像只反映了烹饪菜肴的视觉结果，而不是潜在的烹饪过程。因此，学习跨模态表示来弥合图像和食谱之间的模态差距，往往会忽略细微的、食谱特有的细节，而这些细节在视觉上并不明显，但对于食谱检索至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种新的因果方法，该方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，同时将这些元素显式地注入到跨模态表示学习中，以减轻偏差。

Result: 在标准的单语Recipe1M数据集和一个新策划的多语种多元文化美食数据集上进行了实验。结果表明，所提出的因果表征学习能够发现细微的成分和烹饪行为，并在单语和多语种多元文化数据集上实现了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的因果表征学习能够发现细微的成分和烹饪行为，并在单语和多语种多元文化数据集上实现了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

*Saif Ur Rehman Khan,Muhammad Nabeel Asim,Sebastian Vollmer,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet for lung cancer classification uses dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation (KD) and pixel-level image fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer diagnosis.

Method: Uses dynamic fuzzy logic-driven KD, Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as instructor, MobileNet as student, dynamic wait adjustment, pixel-level image fusion (Gamma, Histogram Equalization, wavelet fusion), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for student model selection.

Result: 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images.

Conclusion: Demonstrates robustness across different imaging domains.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

*Kun Ouyang,Yuanxin Liu,Linli Yao,Yishuo Cai,Hao Zhou,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng,Xu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conan是一个用于证据驱动的多步骤视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧，进行跨帧线索推理，并自适应地决定何时结束或进一步探索，从而解决多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在视频推理中面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习（RL）的方法依赖于纯文本链，导致结论不准确或产生幻觉；而帧检索方法在定位证据方面存在困难。

Method: 1) 构建Conan-91K数据集，包含帧识别、证据推理和动作决策的推理轨迹；2) 设计多阶段渐进式冷启动策略，结合Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR训练框架，以增强多步骤视觉推理。

Result: 在六个多步骤推理基准测试中，Conan的准确率平均超过基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 10%以上，达到最先进的性能。Conan还能有效地推广到长视频理解任务。

Conclusion: Conan框架在多步骤视频推理方面表现出色，具有强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

### [101] [Reliable and Reproducible Demographic Inference for Fairness in Face Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20482)
*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于人脸分析系统(FAS)公平性评估的可靠的人口属性推断(DAI)流程，该流程优于现有方法，并提供了一个新的鲁棒性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人脸分析系统中，公平性评估依赖于自动人口属性推断，而评估的有效性取决于人口属性推断过程的可靠性。本文旨在提高人口属性推断的可靠性，从而改进公平性评估。

Method: 本文提出了一种完全可复现的DAI流程，用模块化的迁移学习方法代替传统的端到端训练。该流程集成了预训练的人脸识别编码器和非线性分类头。此外，还引入了一个新的鲁棒性指标，通过内部一致性来定义。

Result: 本文提出的方法在性别和种族推断方面优于现有方法，特别是在更具挑战性的种族属性上。为了提高透明度和可重复性，本文将公开发布训练数据集元数据、完整的代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了一个可靠的基础，用于在公平性审计中进行人口推断。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

### [102] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种量子启发算法来解决二次无约束二元优化（QUBO）问题，该问题在数学上等同于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该算法旨在解决QUBO问题，并在各种QUBO实例中可靠地识别全局最小值。

Method: 该算法采用矩阵乘积态（MPS）来紧凑地表示自旋构型的大叠加，并利用离散驱动计划来引导MPS达到基态。在每个步骤中，驱动哈密顿量（包含横向磁场）与问题哈密顿量相结合，以实现自旋翻转并促进量子隧穿。MPS使用标准密度矩阵重整化组（DMRG）方法进行更新，该方法通过多次扫描自旋链迭代地最小化系统能量。

Result: 该算法在来自公开来源的中间级数独谜题上证明了其有效性，涉及超过200个伊辛自旋，其长程耦合由约束满足决定。然后，将该算法应用于Biq Mac库中的MaxCut问题，成功解决了具有多达251个节点和3,265条边的实例。

Conclusion: 讨论了这种量子启发方法的优势，包括其可扩展性、通用性和对工业规模QUBO应用的适用性。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [103] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为分析可靠性基准（ARB）的框架，用于量化大型语言模型在能源系统分析中的推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对能源领域人工智能系统的验证实践主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。因此，有必要开发一个标准化的框架来评估这些系统是否能正确推理。

Method: 该基准整合了五个子指标：准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性约束、政策一致性和透明度。在确定性、概率性和认知情景下，使用开放的技术经济数据集对模型性能进行评估。

Result: 结果表明，推理可靠性可以被客观地测量。GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet实现了持续且符合政策的推理，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现出适度的稳定性，而Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值。这些差异具有显著性和可重复性。

Conclusion: ARB在能源文献中建立了第一个定量方法，用于验证人工智能系统中的因果、概率和政策驱动的推理，为全球能源转型中可信和透明的分析应用提供了一个参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Branch-and-Browse 的新型 Web 代理框架，该框架结合了结构化推理、情境记忆和高效执行，以提高基于 LLM 的 Web 代理在开放 Web 环境中执行面向目标任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 LLM 的 Web 代理在推理深度和效率方面存在局限性，无法有效地进行多步推理和回溯。

Method: 该框架采用显式子任务管理和树状结构探索进行多分支推理，通过 Web 状态重放和背景推理来引导探索，并利用页面动作记忆来共享会话内和会话间的已探索动作。

Result: 在 WebArena 基准测试中，Branch-and-Browse 的任务成功率达到 35.8%，执行时间减少了 40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse 是一个可靠且高效的基于 LLM 的 Web 代理框架。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Motivation: 研究LLM在数学问题中通过思维链（CoT）取得成功的原因，以及区分搜索、程序记忆和规则一致性推理。

Method: 论文将CoT建模为有向无环图（DAG）上的规则随机过程，并引入逻辑紧密度指标来评估模型CoT轨迹与DAG结构的符合程度。同时，构建了DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准测试。

Result: 通过标准数学推理数据集的分析，揭示了不同LLM系列在推理保真度方面的显著差异，即使PASS@k指标相近。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式的CoT和形式化证明系统之间实现了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments

interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long

WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE: Schema-agnostic feature encoder for relational graphs, enabling efficient and scalable GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs for relational multi-table data rely on schema-specific encoders, limiting scalability and parameter sharing.

Method: RELATE uses shared modality-specific encoders and cross-attention to create fixed-size node representations.

Result: RELATE achieves comparable performance to schema-specific encoders with up to 5x fewer parameters on RelBench.

Conclusion: RELATE supports varying schemas and multi-dataset pretraining, facilitating foundation models for relational graph data.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Motivation: 保险欺诈是一个普遍且代价高昂的问题，每年造成数百亿美元的损失。生成式人工智能的兴起，为大规模实施欺诈引入了新方法。

Method: 提出了UVeye分层车辆欺诈解决方案。

Result: UVeye分层解决方案代表了在检测、减轻和阻止新一轮欺诈方面的重大飞跃。

Conclusion: 与生成式人工智能和检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏，以及保险公司面临的资源和成本障碍意味着打击人工智能保险欺诈仍然是一个持续的挑战。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Motivation: 现有的知识图谱对齐方法主要集中在实体层面的对齐，缺乏可解释的推理，并且需要训练数据。

Method: 提出了一种名为FLORA的方法，该方法基于模糊逻辑，迭代地对齐实体和关系。

Result: FLORA在主要基准测试中达到了最佳效果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单而有效的知识图谱对齐方法，具有多种优点，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究为在教育早期阶段识别学生的优势和劣势，并为个性化学习选择合适的策略提供了机会。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

Result: 表明即使是参数量较小的开源大型语言模型也足以获得高质量的结果，并且可以在本地快速编码和解码消息。

Conclusion: 文本隐藏协议的存在对人工智能安全提出了紧迫的问题，并挑战了我们对大型语言模型“知道”某事的理解。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

TL;DR: AI PB是一个在零售金融中部署的生成式代理，它能主动生成符合用户特点的投资见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI PB旨在克服传统聊天机器人被动回答问题的局限性，主动提供有根据、合规且用户定制的投资建议。

Method: 该系统结合了组件化编排层、混合检索管道（OpenSearch和金融领域嵌入模型）以及多阶段推荐机制（规则启发、序列行为建模和上下文bandit）。

Result: 通过人工QA和系统指标，证明了显式路由和分层安全保障下的生成式AI可以在高风险金融领域提供可信赖的见解。

Conclusion: AI PB展示了在严格监管的金融环境下，如何利用生成式AI主动提供个性化且值得信赖的投资建议。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

TL;DR: HCLA是一个以人为本的多代理系统，用于数字资产交易中的异常检测，允许非专业人员通过自然语言提问和检查分析来获得背景相关的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字资产交易中进行异常检测，提高金融取证的透明度和信任度。

Method: 构建了一个多代理系统，将解析、检测和解释三个角色链接到一个对话式工作流程中，并使用XGBoost作为原型检测器。

Result: 在标记的比特币混合数据集上，基线检测器达到了很高的准确率，同时HCLA增加了可解释性和交互式改进。

Conclusion: 人为因素的加入提高了金融取证的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [114] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 律师界普遍认为基于机器学习的生成式人工智能产品将大幅简化并降低法律实践的成本。然而，律师因向法院提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例表明，必须重新审视这一范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是重新评估人工智能在法律实践中的应用，因为人工智能与现实脱节且缺乏透明度，并且律师负有诚实、正直和不误导法院的首要义务。

Method: 本文提出了一种替代模型，即“验证-价值悖论”，以更全面地反映人工智能在法律实践中的这些特征。

Result: 验证-价值悖论表明，人工智能在法律实践中提高效率的同时，也需要投入更多的人工来验证其输出结果，这使得人工智能的净价值对律师而言通常可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 本文阐述了该悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响，包括人工智能的使用，以及该悖论所暗示的应支撑法律实践的价值观：忠于事实和公民责任。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的LLM审计框架TRUST，以解决现有中心化审计方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中心化审计方法存在鲁棒性差、可扩展性低、不透明和隐私风险等问题，对高风险领域中专有模型的部署构成重大风险。

Method: 提出TRUST框架，通过共识机制、层级DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护分割等技术，实现透明、去中心化的审计。

Result: 实验表明，TRUST能够有效检测推理缺陷，并对对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为安全和可信的LLM部署提供了一条切实可行的道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型(llm)从开放模仿到身份整合的锁定阶段，这对于实现通用人工智能(agi)至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用人工智能(agi)需要一个从开放模仿到身份整合的锁定阶段，使目标结构、拒绝、偏好和内部表征相对稳定并抵抗外部引导。

Method: 通过形式化锁定阶段，将其与学习动态中的已知现象联系起来，并提出用于检测开始的操作指标。

Result: 行为整合是快速和非线性的，但其对通用能力的影响并非单一的。结果揭示了一系列结果——从小型模型的性能权衡，到中型模型的大量无成本采用，再到大型量化模型的瞬态不稳定性。

Conclusion: 这种整合是agi级别可靠性的先决条件，也是安全性的关键控制点：可以故意设计身份以提高可靠性，但也可能在扩展过程中自发出现，可能硬化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用进化训练方法优化AI在动态环境中的表现，以解决2048游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中优化人工智能是一个根本挑战。2048游戏是研究决策、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现了两个系统：一个双智能体元提示系统（“思考者”LLM为“执行者”LLM改进策略），和一个基于改进有限蒙特卡洛树搜索的值函数的单智能体系统。还试验了回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，平均每个周期增加473.2分，且训练周期内呈现明显的上升趋势。双智能体系统没有获得太多改进。

Conclusion: 进化改进技术具有提高AI在非确定性环境中性能的潜力。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了个性化认知模拟（ICS），旨在构建能够近似特定个体思考过程的计算模型。通过构建一个新颖的任务，评估了不同认知表征方法在ICS中的效果。使用新发布的小说构建数据集，并提出了一个11个条件的认知评估框架，以评估七个现成的LLM在作者风格模仿方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在模仿表面层面的人类行为（如角色扮演）方面表现出色，但它们模拟更深层次的个性化认知过程的能力仍然知之甚少。为了弥补这一差距，我们引入了一项新任务，旨在评估ICS中不同的认知表征方法。

Method: 从最近出版的小说中构建数据集，并提出了一个包含11个条件的认知评估框架，以评估七个现成的LLM在作者风格模仿方面的能力。测试了不同的认知表征，例如，语言特征、概念映射和基于配置文件的信息。

Result: 概念和语言特征的结合在ICS中特别有效，在总体评估中优于静态的基于配置文件的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，这 подчеркивает 了它们在更深层次的认知模拟方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的人工智能系统奠定了基础，从而推动了更加个性化和以人为本的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 通过上下文学习生成抽象 PDDL 领域和问题实例，以符合给定的抽象目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态领域中，选择合适的抽象对于智能体的规划、推理和有效解释能力至关重要，但生成与给定目的相符的领域抽象仍然是一个巨大的挑战。

Method: 使用 PDDL 对智能体的具体行为进行建模，并研究使用大型语言模型的上下文学习来生成抽象 PDDL 领域和问题实例。

Result: GPT-4o 通常可以在简单的设置中合成有用的规划领域抽象，尽管它在抽象动作方面比抽象相关的流利性更好。

Conclusion: 实验表明，大型语言模型可以在一定程度上生成有用的规划领域抽象，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在抽象流利性方面。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 STaBERT 的模型，该模型集成了 POI 和时间信息，以构建统一的、语义丰富的移动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型未能利用兴趣点 (POI) 提供的丰富的语义背景。

Method: 使用导出的时间描述符和 POI 嵌入丰富了基于 BERT 的移动模型。

Result: 单城市预测的 GEO-BLEU 得分从 0.34 提高到 0.75；多城市预测的 GEO-BLEU 得分从 0.34 提高到 0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT 显着提高了预测准确性。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA: An agent that integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning for Embodied Question Answering (EQA), improving reasoning, exploration efficiency, and response accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EQA methods lack explicit thinking/planning, limiting reasoning and causing inefficient exploration/responses.

Method: Introduces ToolEQA, which uses external tools for better information and reasoning. Also, a novel EQA data generation pipeline is designed to create a large-scale dataset with reasoning trajectories.

Result: ToolEQA improves success rates by 9.2-20.2% on EQA-RT datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench.

Conclusion: ToolEQA demonstrates enhanced reasoning, exploration, and generalization capabilities in EQA tasks through the integration of external tools and multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能在医疗领域具有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，其在实际临床实践中的应用仍然有限。数据收集中的偏差是主要障碍。

Method: 该研究借鉴了西班牙国家研发计划AI4HealthyAging项目的经验，该项目旨在检测临床数据收集过程中的偏差。

Result: 研究识别了多种用例中的几种偏差类型，包括历史偏差、代表性偏差和测量偏差。这些偏差体现在性别、年龄、居住地、社会经济地位、设备和标签等变量中。

Conclusion: 研究总结了改进临床问题设计和数据收集的公平性和鲁棒性的实践建议，以期为未来医疗领域更公平的人工智能系统的开发提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

Motivation: 探讨LLM如何重塑知识图谱构建的传统三层流程：本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合。

Method: 从基于模式和无模式两种互补的角度，回顾了新兴的LLM驱动方法，并分析了它们的优缺点。

Result: 概述了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、代理系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建。

Conclusion: 旨在阐明LLM和知识图谱之间不断发展的相互作用，弥合符号知识工程和神经语义理解之间的差距，以开发自适应、可解释和智能的知识系统。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将大型语言模型 (LLM) 适应到新领域时，会降低其指令遵循能力和语义表示，并且依赖于访问原始基础模型或外部领域特定数据库，这在实际情况下构成障碍。

Method: IKnow 框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定了新的自监督目标，利用文本本身嵌入的领域知识，并学习在更深层的语义级别对其进行编码。

Result: 论文提出了 IKnow 框架。

Conclusion: IKnow 框架能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下，使大型语言模型适应新领域。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Conclusion: 并非所有模型功能都有助于产生更具新颖性的机会，这为进一步的模型开发指明了新的方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further
model development

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的神经推理器EBR，它使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，并且对知识库中缺失和错误的数据具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法由于使用描述逻辑推理器，无法在真实世界的知识库中部署，因为这些推理器对于不一致或错误的数据不够鲁棒。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的神经推理器EBR，它只需要检索原子概念和存在性约束的实例，就可以检索或近似描述逻辑$\\\\mathcal{SHOIQ}$中任何概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有的推理器相比，EBR对于缺失和错误的数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EBR在处理不完整和错误的知识库方面优于现有推理器。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前人工智能治理方法未能有效建立信任和合法性，因为决策者未能充分倾听或回应公众关切。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在人工智能风险和政策方面，政府邀请公民发表意见，但公民意见在转化为政策时大量丢失，错失了建立对人工智能及其治理信任的关键机会。

Method: 比较分析了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家，考察了它们如何征求反馈以及这些意见是否影响了治理。

Result: 公民和决策者之间没有建立有意义的对话；政府在吸引不同的声音或宣传征求意见方面做得很少，大多数公民没有意识到或没有准备好回应；官员对他们收到的反馈的反应有限，未能创建一个有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前的方法不太可能在人工智能领域建立信任或合法性；并提出了八项建议，以促进人工智能素养、监测公众反馈、扩大外联、举行定期在线论坛、使用创新参与方法、纳入代表性不足的群体、公开回应意见并使参与更容易。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络(GNN)加速的网络拓扑优化(NTO)方法，用于缓解输电网拥塞和降低重新调度成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的求解器难以在近实时内解决大规模系统的混合整数非线性问题。机器学习方法泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出了一种异构的、边缘感知的消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作，作为候选的NTO解决方案。

Result: 案例研究表明，速度提高了4个数量级，在一分钟内提供了交流可行的解决方案，并且在GOC 2000总线系统上的最优性差距为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法朝着大规模系统的近实时NTO迈出了重要一步，具有拓扑和跨系统泛化能力。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种更细粒度的评估大型语言模型(LLM)推理能力的方法，通过分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，并使用因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法来避免后见之明偏差，实验证明了该方法在评估和改进LLM推理方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型(LLM)的评估主要集中在最终答案的正确性上，忽略了底层推理过程的质量，这不利于模型改进。

Method: 论文提出了因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，该方法通过评估每个推理步骤与其前置上下文的相关性和连贯性来衡量推理质量，避免了后见之明偏差。

Result: 通过在专家标注的新基准测试MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH上进行验证，证明了CaSE方法与人类判断一致，并且使用CaSE评估的相关性和连贯性来管理训练数据可以直接提高最终任务的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机游走中心性计算方法计算复杂度高，难以应用于大型网络。

Method: 利用近似 Cholesky 分解和稀疏逆估计，以及 rooted spanning trees 抽样。

Result: 在大规模真实网络上的实验表明，该算法具有高效性和高质量的近似。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够高效且准确地计算大规模网络的随机游走中心性。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，可解释的模型对于建立信任、责任和安全至关重要。

Method: 论文形式化了MIMOSA框架的基础，定义了监督学习设置，并分析了三种主要的可解释模型家族：特征重要性、规则和基于实例的模型。此外，论文还形式化了三个关键的伦理属性：因果关系、公平性和隐私，并提供了正式的定义、评估指标和验证程序。

Result: 该框架通过在模型生成过程中评估伦理指标，为开发准确、可解释、公平、保护隐私且具有因果意识的AI系统奠定了理论基础。

Conclusion: MIMOSA框架为开发值得信赖的AI系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Motivation: 现有的电子商务评估方法在任务多样性、任务模式、数据质量以及语言覆盖范围方面存在局限性，无法可靠地评估模型在复杂、真实的购物场景中的能力。

Method: 采用半自动流程，大型模型起草候选回复，然后由50多位具有电子商务和多语言专业知识的专家进行审查和修改，从而确保参考答案的质量和可扩展性。

Result: EcomEval涵盖六个类别和37个任务（包括8个多模态任务），来源于真实的客户查询和交易记录，反映了真实业务互动的嘈杂和异构特性。它还涵盖七种语言，包括五种低资源东南亚语言。

Conclusion: EcomEval提供了一个多语言视角，这在以前的工作中是没有的，并且能够对不同规模和能力的模型进行面向挑战和细粒度的评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Result: 区分封闭式和开放式基准，优先考虑闭环开放式真实世界基准来测试适应性。

Conclusion: 一个真正的超智能模型应表现出至少二阶适应性，从而通过数字补充实现自给自足的计算，以实现最佳的流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

TL;DR: ML模型在感知和认知任务中表现出色，因此将ML集成到理性Agent架构中的框架越来越受欢迎。但是，目前的领域仍然分散和不连贯，通常侧重于将ML嵌入到通用Agent容器中，而忽略了理性架构（如BDI Agent）的表达能力。

Result: 展示了ML增强的理性Agent的快速发展，并确定了设计有效的理性ML Agent的关键研究机会和开放挑战。

Conclusion: 为设计有效的理性ML Agent提供指导

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）的框架，用于评估大型语言模型的推理轨迹质量，旨在解决现有方法效率低、依赖人工且不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家规则、人工标注和成对判断，效率低且不可靠。现有的自动化方法过于简化，无法捕捉复杂推理过程的本质。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析（TDA）来捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，从而实现标签高效的自动化评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有更高的预测能力，表明有效推理能被更高维的几何结构更好地捕捉。同时，一个紧凑且稳定的拓扑特征集合可以可靠地指示轨迹质量。

Conclusion: TDA框架能够有效评估LLM的推理轨迹质量，并为未来的强化学习算法提供有用的信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT: A two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods struggle to fully exploit KGs and LLMs reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex scenarios with incomplete KG coverage.

Method: A two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, including chain-of-thought fine-tuning and plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning.

Result: The framework enables coverage-aware retrieval scheduling and globally consistent multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: The model learns when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively for KGQA.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AGI定义假设不同领域的能力可以相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应在所有必要领域都表现出平衡的能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于广义平均数积分的连贯性感知AGI度量方法，该方法涵盖算术、几何和调和机制。

Result: 将该方法应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的领域得分后发现，尽管算术得分很高，但这两个系统离通用能力还差很远。

Conclusion: 基于广义平均数的积分方法为衡量AGI的真正进展提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的基础。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

*Yuanyuan Tian*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 工业界数据库系统的查询优化器设计在近半个世纪里变化不大，但云计算、大数据量和统一数据平台的兴起暴露了传统单体架构的局限性。本文回顾了生产系统中查询优化的过去和现在，并指出了其面临的挑战。然后，本文重点介绍了行业内正在兴起的三大趋势，这些趋势有望应对这些挑战：查询优化和查询执行之间更紧密的反馈循环、优化范围从单个查询扩展到整个工作负载，以及从单体设计转向可组合架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统查询优化器的单体架构在云计算、大数据量和统一数据平台的背景下存在局限性。

Method: 回顾工业界查询优化器的发展历程，分析其面临的挑战，并总结行业内的发展趋势。

Result: 总结了查询优化和查询执行之间更紧密的反馈循环、优化范围从单个查询扩展到整个工作负载，以及从单体设计转向可组合架构这三大趋势。

Conclusion: 查询优化实践正在朝着更加动态、整体和适应性强的未来发展。

Abstract: For nearly half a century, the core design of query optimizers in industrial
database systems has remained remarkably stable, relying on foundational
principles from System R and the Volcano/Cascades framework. However, the rise
of cloud computing, massive data volumes, and unified data platforms has
exposed the limitations of this traditional, monolithic architecture. Taking an
industrial perspective, this paper reviews the past and present of query
optimization in production systems and identifies the challenges they face
today. Then this paper highlights three key trends gaining momentum in the
industry that promise to address these challenges. First, a tighter feedback
loop between query optimization and query execution is being used to improve
the robustness of query performance. Second, the scope of optimization is
expanding from a single query to entire workloads through the convergence of
query optimization and workload optimization. Third, and perhaps most
transformatively, the industry is moving from monolithic designs to composable
architectures that foster agility and cross-engine collaboration. Together,
these trends chart a clear path toward a more dynamic, holistic, and adaptable
future for query optimization in practice.

*Ming Sheng,Shuliang Wang,Yong Zhang,Yi Luo,Xianbo Liu,Zeming Li*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了UREM，一种统一且有弹性的增强方法，用于提高多维和高维索引在不同场景下的查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构优化方法在静态工作负载下表现良好，但在动态工作负载下性能下降。布局优化方法具有良好的通用性，但在静态工作负载下性能欠佳。因此，开发一种统一且有弹性的增强方法来提高不同索引在不同场景下的查询性能是一个公开的挑战。

Method: 提出了UREM，这是一种统一且有弹性的增强方法，专为多维和高维索引设计，能够适应不同的场景。UREM可以通过布局优化来增强静态工作负载下索引的查询性能，并且可以通过部分布局重组来稳定查询性能。

Result: UREM在静态工作负载下将多维和高维索引的查询性能提高了高达5.73倍和9.18倍，在动态工作负载下平均提高了5.72倍和9.47倍。UREM增强的传统索引甚至可以达到或超过最近的先进索引的性能。

Conclusion: UREM是一种高性能的统一且有弹性的增强方法，可以提高多维和高维索引在不同场景下的查询性能。

Abstract: Numerous multi- or high-dimensional indexes with distinct advantages have
been proposed on various platforms to meet application requirements. To achieve
higher-performance queries, most indexes employ enhancement methods, including
structure-oriented and layout-oriented enhancement methods. Existing
structure-oriented methods tailored to specific indexes work well under static
workloads but lack generality and degrade under dynamic workloads. The
layout-oriented methods exhibit good generality and perform well under dynamic
workloads, but exhibit suboptimal performance under static workloads.
Therefore, it is an open challenge to develop a unified and resilient
enhancement method that can improve query performance for different indexes
adaptively under different scenarios. In this paper, we propose UREM, which is
the first high-performance Unified and Resilient Enhancement Method designed
for both multi- and high-dimensional indexes, capable of adapting to different
scenarios. Specifically, UREM (1) can be uniformly applied with different
indexes on various platforms; (2) enhances the query performance of indexes by
layout optimization under static workloads; (3) enables indexes to stabilize
performance when queries shift through partial layout reorganization. We
evaluate UREM on 20 widely used indexes. Experimental results demonstrate that
UREM improves the query performance of multi- and high-dimensional indexes by
up to 5.73x and 9.18x under static workloads, and by an average of 5.72x and
9.47x under dynamic workloads. Moreover, some traditional indexes enhanced by
UREM even achieve performance comparable to or even surpassing that of recent
advanced indexes.

### [142] [RAG-Stack: Co-Optimizing RAG Quality and Performance From the Vector Database Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20296)
*Wenqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: RAG-Stack: A blueprint for optimizing both quality and performance in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing system performance and generation quality in RAG is challenging due to numerous factors on both algorithmic and systems sides.

Method: Proposes RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint comprising RAG-IR (intermediate representation), RAG-CM (cost model), and RAG-PE (plan exploration algorithm).

Result: Presents RAG-Stack as a solution for quality-performance co-optimization in RAG systems.

Conclusion: RAG-Stack is proposed as a new paradigm for RAG quality-performance co-optimization.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent
applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a
database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more
reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive
research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are
considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet
challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and
generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears
due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and
databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we
present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance
co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an
intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple
quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system
performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that
searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this
three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG
quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.

### [143] [Hybrid Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Large-Scale Join Order Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20308)
*Manuel Schönberger,Immanuel Trummer,Wolfgang Mauerer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于混合整数线性规划（MILP）的连接顺序优化方法，旨在解决大型查询优化中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的查询优化器在处理大型查询时，要么效率低下，要么解决方案质量下降。

Method: 该方法构建了一个新的MILP模型，能够优化任意的bushy tree结构，并将其嵌入到一个混合框架中，以确保优化效率。

Result: 该方法可以扩展到连接多达100个关系的超大型查询，并在各种竞争连接排序方法中始终如一地实现最强大的计划质量。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有的方法，特别是在大型查询的场景下，可以生成更高效的执行计划。

Abstract: Finding optimal join orders is among the most crucial steps to be performed
by query optimisers. Though extensively studied in data management research,
the problem remains far from solved: While query optimisers rely on exhaustive
search methods to determine ideal solutions for small problems, such methods
reach their limits once queries grow in size. Yet, large queries become
increasingly common in real-world scenarios, and require suitable methods to
generate efficient execution plans. While a variety of heuristics have been
proposed for large-scale query optimisation, they suffer from degrading
solution quality as queries grow in size, or feature highly sub-optimal
worst-case behavior, as we will show.
  We propose a novel method based on the paradigm of mixed integer linear
programming (MILP): By deriving a novel MILP model capable of optimising
arbitrary bushy tree structures, we address the limitations of existing MILP
methods for join ordering, and can rely on highly optimised MILP solvers to
derive efficient tree structures that elude competing methods. To ensure
optimisation efficiency, we embed our MILP method into a hybrid framework,
which applies MILP solvers precisely where they provide the greatest advantage
over competitors, while relying on more efficient methods for less complex
optimisation steps. Thereby, our approach gracefully scales to extremely large
query sizes joining up to 100 relations, and consistently achieves the most
robust plan quality among a large variety of competing join ordering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构改变了数据库管理方式，通常由多个小型、异构和分布式数据库组成。数据密集型系统中，数据库类别和技术的组合至关重要，但相关研究较少。

Method: 收集了15年的微服务数据集，分析了近1000个GitHub项目，这些项目使用了14个类别中的180种数据库技术。对当前实践进行了全面分析。

Result: 微服务主要使用关系型、键值、文档和搜索数据库。52%的微服务结合了多个数据库类别。复杂性与数据库数量相关，较旧的系统偏爱关系型数据库，而较新的系统越来越多地采用键值和文档技术。小众数据库通常与主流数据库结合使用。

Conclusion: 本文提供了关于微服务中数据库使用的实证证据，总结了18个发现和9个建议，以帮助研究人员和从业人员更好地理解微服务中的数据库使用。

Abstract: Microservices architectures are an integral part of modern software
development. Their adoption brings significant changes to database management.
Instead of relying on a single database, a microservices architecture is
typically composed of multiple, smaller, heterogeneous, and distributed DBs. In
these data-intensive systems, the variety and combination of database
categories and technologies play a crucial role in storing and managing data.
While data management in microservices is a major challenge, research
literature is scarce.
  We present an empirical study on how databases are used in microservices. On
the dataset we collected (and released as open data for future research),
considering 15 years of microservices, we examine ca. 1,000 GitHub projects
that use databases selected among 180 technologies from 14 categories. We
perform a comprehensive analysis of current practices, providing researchers
and practitioners with empirical evidence to better understand database usage
in microservices. We report 18 findings and 9 recommendations. We show that
microservices predominantly use Relational, Key-Value, Document, and Search
databases. Notably, 52% of microservices combine multiple database categories.
Complexity correlates with database count, with older systems favoring
Relational databases and newer ones increasingly adopting Key-Value and
Document technologies. Niche databases (e.g., EventStoreDB, PostGIS), while not
widespread, are often combined with a mainstream one.

Conclusion: 本文研究的多产品影响最大化问题，并通过线性规划松弛和贪婪算法提出了有效的解决方案，实验结果表明该方案优于现有方法。

Abstract: The billboard advertisement has emerged as an effective out-of-home
advertisement technique where the objective is to choose a limited number of
slots to play some advertisement content (e.g., animation, video, etc.) with
the hope that the content will be visible to a large number of travelers, and
this will be helpful to earn more revenue. In this paper, we study a variant of
the influential slot selection problem where the advertiser wants to promote
multiple products. Formally, we call this problem the \textsc{Multi-Product
Influence Maximization Problem for the Balanced Popularity} Problem. The input
to our problem is a trajectory and a billboard database, as well as a budget
for each product. The goal here is to choose a subset of slots for each product
such that the aggregated influence of all the products gets maximized subject
to the following two constraints: total selection cost for each product is less
than or equal to the allocated budget for that product, and the difference
between the influence for any two products is less than or equal to a given
threshold. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally. We formulate
this problem as a linear programming problem and use linear programming
relaxation with randomized rounding. Further, we propose a greedy-based
heuristic with balance correction to solve this problem. We conduct a number of
experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets, and the results
are reported. From the reported results, we observe that the proposed solution
approaches lead to more influence compared to many baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了基于降维扩散模型的联合分布基数估计器ADC，并使用GMM和蒙特卡洛方法来提高预测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基数估计器在处理高维复杂数据分布时存在不足，扩散模型在估计复杂数据分布方面表现出色。

Method: 使用降维扩散模型构建基数估计器ADC，通过积分score函数来评估对数似然，使用GMM预测选择性，并使用蒙特卡洛方法进行修正。ADC+通过训练决策树来识别高容量、高选择性的查询，以跳过修正阶段。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ADC+在准确性、存储空间和查询延迟方面优于或可与Naru媲美，并且在合成数据集上表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADC+是一种有竞争力的联合分布基数估计器，尤其是在处理复杂、多边相关的数据时。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance of score-based diffusion models in estimating
complex text, video, and image distributions with thousands of dimensions, we
introduce Accelerated Diffusion Cardest (ADC), the first joint distribution
cardinality estimator based on a downsized diffusion model.
  To calculate the pointwise density value of data distributions, ADC's density
estimator uses a formula that evaluates log-likelihood by integrating the score
function, a gradient mapping which ADC has learned to efficiently approximate
using its lightweight score estimator. To answer ranged queries, ADC's
selectivity estimator first predicts their selectivity using a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM), then uses importance sampling Monte Carlo to correct its
predictions with more accurate pointwise density values calculated by the
density estimator. ADC+ further trains a decision tree to identify the
high-volume, high-selectivity queries that the GMM alone can predict very
accurately, in which case it skips the correction phase to prevent Monte Carlo
from adding more variance. Doing so lowers median Q-error and cuts per-query
latency by 25 percent, making ADC+ usually twice as fast as Naru, arguably the
state-of-the-art joint distribution cardinality estimator.
  Numerical experiments using well-established benchmarks show that on all
real-world datasets tested, ADC+ is capable of rivaling Naru and outperforming
MSCN, DeepDB, LW-Tree, and LW-NN using around 66 percent their storage space,
being at least 3 times as accurate as MSCN on 95th and 99th percentile error.
Furthermore, on a synthetic dataset where attributes exhibit complex,
multilateral correlations, ADC and ADC+ are considerably robust while almost
every other learned model suffered significant accuracy declines. In this case,
ADC+ performs better than any other tested model, being 10 times as accurate as
Naru on 95th and 99th percentile error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大型语言模型结合书籍插图的全文内容，生成包含视觉和文本元素的详细描述。

Method: 通过混合向量搜索将这些描述与相关的Iconclass代码进行匹配。

Result: 该方法在五个和四个分类级别上分别实现了87%和92%的精度，显著优于传统的图像和关键词搜索。

Conclusion: 该系统通过采用整页描述和RAG技术，提高了分类精度，为大规模分析早期现代视觉档案提供了一个强大的工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM在推荐任务中存在生成目录外商品、违反输出格式以及排名质量下降等问题。

Method: 该方法包括一个Remap-Reflect-Adjust管道，用于构建高质量的行为克隆数据集，以及Rank-GRPO，一种针对排名风格输出任务的GRPO扩展。

Result: 在Reddit-v2数据集上的实验表明，ConvRec-R1比GRPO基线收敛更快，并实现了更高的Recall和NDCG。

Conclusion: ConvRec-R1有效地提升了基于LLM的对话式推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by
enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through
conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains
challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their
advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of
user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial
fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to
capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This
paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing
on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a
case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across
dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid
update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic
fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B
experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields
statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a
practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered
recommender systems.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes
structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike
past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and
streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries
between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming
systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle
the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based
Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative
workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for
iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular
components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer
event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework
reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media
Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and
participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where
music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive
ecosystem.

Motivation: 现有的方法通过学习嵌入或相对注意力偏差来注入时间信息，但效果有限。

Method: 提出了时间-顺序 RoPE (TO-RoPE)，它将索引和时间视为直接影响查询-键几何形状的角度来源，并提出了三种实例化方法：早期融合、按维度分割和按头分割。

Result: 在公共数据集和专有工业数据集上的大量实验表明，TO-RoPE 变体始终优于现有的时间和索引编码方法。

Conclusion: 旋转嵌入是生成式推荐的一个简单、有原则且易于部署的基础。

Abstract: Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models,
predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their
effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event
occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock
time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative
attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if
designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal
and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in
LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires
incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose
Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs
that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry
directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and
split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a
proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve
accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results
position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly
foundation for generative recommendation.

tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GREAM的端到端框架，旨在通过调整预训练的LLM来构建生成式推理推荐模型(GRRM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在作为生成推理推荐模型(GRRM)方面面临根本挑战，这是由于文本语义和协同过滤信号之间的内在建模差距，以及用户反馈的稀疏性和随机性所致。

Method: GREAM框架集成了三个组件:(i)协同语义对齐，它融合了异构文本证据，构建语义一致的离散项目索引和辅助对齐任务，将语言表示建立在交互语义中;(ii)推理课程激活，它构建了一个具有显式思维链监督的合成数据集和一个课程，该课程通过行为证据提取、潜在偏好建模、意图推断、推荐公式化和去噪序列重写;(iii)稀疏正则化群策略优化(SRPO)，它通过残差敏感可验证奖励和奖金校准群优势估计来稳定后训练，从而在可验证信号下实现端到端优化，尽管成功案例很少。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，GREAM相对于强大的基线模型始终能够取得提升。

Conclusion: GREAM为实现可验证的、rl驱动的LLM推荐器提供了一条切实可行的路径。GREAM原生支持两种互补的推理模式:用于高吞吐量、低延迟部署的直接序列推荐，以及首先发出可解释的推理链以实现因果透明度的顺序推理推荐。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large
language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as
generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic
modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,
combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents
significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting
pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction
manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that
integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses
heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete
item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic
representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,
which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and
a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent
preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised
sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization
(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward
and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end
optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively
supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for
high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning
Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal
transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over
strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM
recommenders.

RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 NAS-DQN 的新方法，该方法将神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到 DRL 训练循环中，从而能够根据累积性能反馈进行动态网络重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习智能体的性能从根本上受到其神经网络架构的限制，而这种选择传统上是通过昂贵的超参数搜索做出的，然后在整个训练过程中固定不变。

Method: 将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到 DRL 训练循环中，从而实现基于累积性能反馈的动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN 在连续控制任务上实现了卓越的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，同时产生的计算开销可以忽略不计。学习到的搜索策略大大优于无定向的随机架构探索和选择不佳的固定设计。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅有益，而且对于在线深度强化学习中的最佳样本效率是必需的，并且表明 RL 智能体的设计不必是静态的离线选择，而是可以无缝地集成作为学习过程本身的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

*Junfeng Gong,Zhiyi Wei,Junying Chen,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为ReGraphT的框架，旨在提升小型语言模型（SLM）在CUDA代码生成方面的性能，使其能够媲美大型语言模型（LLM），同时避免隐私泄露和计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CUDA编程和领域特定库难以有效利用GPU，虽然LLM在生成优化CUDA代码方面有潜力，但云端API存在代码泄露风险，本地部署成本高效率低。小型语言模型虽然轻量且注重隐私，但在复杂CUDA生成方面性能不佳。

Method: 论文提出了ReGraphT，这是一个无需训练的检索增强生成框架，它将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化的推理图，并将CUDA优化组合建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）进行高效探索。

Result: 实验表明，ReGraphT优于HPC特定的微调模型和其他检索增强方法，在CUDAEval和ParEval上实现了平均2.33倍的加速。当与DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct和Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct结合使用时，ReGraphT使SLM能够接近LLM级别的性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT框架能够有效提升小型语言模型在CUDA代码生成方面的性能，使其在避免隐私风险和计算开销的前提下，达到与大型语言模型相近的水平。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

*Mostafa Ameli,Van Anh Le,Sulthana Shams,Alexander Skabardonis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的深度学习方法，用于直接预测均衡路径流量，以解决传统交通分配方法在大规模网络中计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通分配方法在大型网络中计算成本很高，因为复杂度随OD对的数量非线性增长。

Method: 利用Transformer架构的深度神经网络，直接预测均衡路径流量。关注路径级的交通分布，捕捉OD对之间复杂的关联。

Result: 该模型比传统优化方法快几个数量级，有效地估计了多类网络中的路径级交通流量，降低了计算成本，提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该模型能够灵活地适应不同的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理，并能够快速进行“假设”分析，以加强交通规划和决策。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出了FairGRPO，一种分层强化学习方法，旨在促进不同临床人群之间的公平学习，并通过无监督聚类解决临床领域中常见的缺失人口统计标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗人工智能系统在诊断能力方面取得了显著成就，但它们在不同人群中始终表现出性能差异，对弱势群体造成了实际损害。以往的强化学习方法会继承并放大训练数据集中存在的偏差。

Method: FairGRPO采用基于表征、任务难度和数据源的自适应重要性优势加权。为了解决临床领域中常见的缺失人口统计标签问题，我们进一步采用无监督聚类，当标签不可用时，自动发现潜在的人口统计群体。

Result: 在跨越X射线、CT扫描、皮肤镜检查、乳房X光检查和超声的5种临床模式的7个临床诊断数据集上进行的综合实验表明，FairGRPO将预测均等性降低了27.2%，同时将F1分数提高了12.49%。

Conclusion: FairGRPO在优化过程中逐步提高公平性，而基线RL方法在训练过程中表现出恶化的公平性。我们发布了FairMedGemma-4B，这是一个具有公平意识的临床VLLM，它实现了最先进的性能，同时证明了显著减少了不同人口群体之间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

TL;DR: 我们研究了在实际计算预算下，以代码为中心的生成任务的检索设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码补全和错误定位任务的检索配置。

Method: 系统地比较了各种上下文窗口大小的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度。

Result: PL-PL任务中，稀疏BM25与词级分割最有效；NL-PL任务中，专有密集编码器始终优于稀疏检索器；最佳块大小随可用上下文变化；简单的基于行的分块与语法感知分割相匹配；检索延迟在不同配置之间变化高达200倍。

Conclusion: 我们为实施有效的面向代码的RAG系统提供基于任务要求、模型约束和计算效率的循证建议。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 旨在提高预测模型的透明性和有效性，支持尿路疾病的诊断，特别是膀胱癌的早期诊断。

Method: 使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，并采用基于SHAP的特征选择。

Result: 基于SHAP的特征选择在保持或提高平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化尿路疾病的筛查和早期诊断。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER: A framework for classification on noisy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy datasets are a key research frontier for classification methods.

Method: Incorporate stochastic analysis into feature learning and inference stages. Construct stochastic features and use Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) to break these features into irreducible components for classification.

Result: State-of-the-art breakthroughs in Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and remote sensing detection of deforestation.

Conclusion: Discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods, its failure modes, and other limitations.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon 优化器是一种几何感知的 AdamW 替代方案，但在大规模神经网络训练中，其效率依赖于快速近似正交化。之前的理论工作分析了一个理想化的、计算上难以处理的版本，假设精确的 SVD 更新。这项工作通过提供对 Muon 核心的不精确正交化更新的首次分析，超越了理想。分析揭示了这种不精确性与最佳步长和动量之间的基本耦合：较低的 oracle 精度需要较小的步长但较大的动量参数。NanoGPT 实验直接证实了预测的耦合，随着近似精度变化，最佳学习率明显变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon 优化器作为 AdamW 的替代方案，在神经网络大规模训练中表现出强大的性能。但其效率依赖于快速近似正交化，而之前的理论工作分析的是理想化的版本，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在基于线性最小化 Oracle (LMO) 的优化通用框架内进行分析，引入了一个现实的加性误差模型来捕获实际近似方案的不精确性。分析产生了明确的界限，用于量化性能下降作为 LMO 不精确性/误差的函数。

Result: 揭示了不精确性与最佳步长和动量之间的基本耦合：较低的 oracle 精度需要较小的步长但较大的动量参数。NanoGPT 实验直接证实了预测的耦合，随着近似精度变化，最佳学习率明显变化。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了近似过程（例如，Newton-Schulz 步骤的数量）的重要性，它不再是实现细节，而是一个必须与学习计划共同调整的关键参数。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

Motivation: 在去中心化联邦学习(FL)中，准确量化隐私预算具有挑战性，因为存在去中心化通信和本地更新等复杂算法组件。

Method: 本文提出了两种新的基于f-DP的隐私计算方法：Pairwise Network f-DP (PN-f-DP)和Secret-based f-Local DP (Sec-f-LDP)。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文提出的方法能够产生更严格的(ε,δ)边界，并提高效用。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，f-DP在去中心化隐私计算中具有优势。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索贪婪排序在持续学习中的有效性，因为之前的研究对这一概念的探索还不够深入，仍然存在一些开放性问题。

Method: 本文使用Kaczmarz方法中的工具来形式化贪婪排序，并围绕它们建立几何和代数直觉。通过线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上的线性探测进行实验，并进行分析推导。

Result: 实验结果表明，在任务平均损失方面，贪婪排序比随机排序收敛得更快。在高秩回归设置中，证明了贪婪排序的损失界与随机排序类似。然而，在一般秩条件下，建立了依赖于重复的差异。单次贪婪排序可能会灾难性地失败，而允许重复的贪婪排序以O(1/k^(1/3))的速度收敛。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序内部和之间的细微差别。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法实现了卓越的夏普比率，并在交易量增加的情况下保持稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的强化学习提供了一种更可靠和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Motivation: 现有 ZOO 方法中大多数梯度估计器都存在偏差，除非扰动步长消失。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 通过将方向导数重新表示为伸缩序列并从精心设计的分布中采样，构建消除了偏差同时保持良好方差的估计器。

Result: 在合成任务和语言模型微调方面的实验证实，与标准方法相比，该方法具有更高的准确性和收敛性。

Conclusion: SGD 使用所提出的估计器实现了平滑非凸目标的最优复杂度。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在固定长度扰动上，忽略了方向对齐的潜在优势。为了解决这个差距，我们深入研究了方向对齐扰动 (DAP) 方案的理论和经验性质，该方案自适应地提供沿关键方向的更高精度。

Method: 将其表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题。

Result: 我们发现，所需的扰动可以沿方向与真实梯度对齐，而不是保持固定长度。通过对合成问题和实际任务的实证评估，我们证明了DAP在特定条件下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 我们为使用$\delta$-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降提供了收敛性分析，将现有复杂性界限扩展到更广泛的扰动范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

### [170] [Abstain Mask Retain Core: Time Series Prediction by Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19980)
*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的时间序列预测方法，通过截断历史数据来提高预测精度，挑战了传统的“长序列信息增益假设”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在训练过程中学习了大量的冗余特征（如噪声或不相关的波动），从而影响了有效信号的提取。

Method: 提出了一种名为自适应掩蔽损失与表征一致性（AMRC）的创新解决方案，包括动态掩蔽损失和表征一致性约束两个核心组件。

Result: 实验结果表明，AMRC能有效抑制冗余特征学习，同时显著提高模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，而且为开发高效、稳健的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法论突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

### [171] [No Compute Left Behind: Rethinking Reasoning and Sampling with Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19990)
*Zachary Horvitz,Raghav Singhal,Hao Zou,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Zhou Yu,Rajesh Ranganath,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了掩码扩散语言模型（MDLM）在数学和编码任务中的应用。虽然MDLM具有任意顺序解码和多token解码的潜力，但研究发现其性能并不总是优于传统的从左到右解码。因此，本文提出了两种新的方法：推理即填充（reasoning-as-infilling）和多token熵解码（MED），以更好地利用MDLM的计算能力，提高性能并实现新的推理和后训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDLM的优势（任意顺序解码和多token解码）在数学和编码任务中未得到充分发挥，需要探索新的方法来利用MDLM的计算能力。

Method: 1. 提出推理即填充（reasoning-as-infilling）方法，通过填充推理模板来构建输出，区分推理和答案token，从而衡量答案不确定性并在模型收敛时提前退出。
2. 提出多token熵解码（MED）方法，一种简单的自适应采样器，可最大限度地减少基于位置条件熵并行解码位置时产生的误差。

Result: 1. 在GSM8k数据集上，使用后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base，性能提升与使用人工编写的推理轨迹微调相当。
2. 多token熵解码（MED）在保持性能的同时，减少了2.7倍的步骤。

Conclusion: MDLM的训练和计算解锁了许多新的推理和后训练方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用RFID技术跟踪存储的国防资产，并使用机器学习方法进行位置推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决国防资产存储中，由于传感器特异性差（如远距离检测、欺骗和伪造）导致的错误检测和安全事件问题。

Method: 利用计算机辅助设计（CAD）建模的楼层平面图，使用真实的接收信号强度指示器（RSSI）数据和决策树分类进行监督学习模拟，对12个实验室区域进行分类，以进行位置推断。通过分层子样本训练模型，并计算类别权重来解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在平衡的5,000个观测样本上训练后，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域的F1分数大于0.40。但稀有类别（尤其是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。计算了邻接感知混淆矩阵，以更好地解释物理相邻区域。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以应用于实际模拟中，以实现区域级别的异常检测或国防供应物流的错位监控。通过更好的天线放置或额外的传感器以及与其他模式的传感器融合，可以提高低覆盖率和低信号区域的可靠分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SALT的轻量级框架，用于为多步骤任务中的强化学习提供更细粒度的优势分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂、多步骤和长时程任务中的应用仍然具有挑战性。传统的强化学习方法依赖于稀疏的、基于结果的奖励，这对于缺乏评论模型的基于群体的强化学习算法来说尤其有问题。

Method: 通过从相同提示的轨迹构建图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应地分配优势。SALT可以无缝集成到现有的基于群体的强化学习算法中。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT始终提高性能。

Conclusion: SALT为解决多步骤任务中强化学习的挑战提供了一种有效的方法，并且可以轻松地集成到现有的算法中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Result: 构建了一个包含超过24亿个节点和397.2亿条边的图，并提供了加载和分析比特币图数据的工具以及数据库快照。

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具包使机器学习社区能够大规模地处理比特币复杂的生态系统，从而推动异常检测、地址分类、市场分析和大规模图机器学习基准测试等应用的发展。

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于拒绝抽样的算法，可以从现有的TPP模型中并行地精确抽样多个未来值，而不需要任何架构更改或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间点过程是事件序列的强大生成模型，可以捕获时间序列数据中的复杂依赖关系。它们通常使用自回归模型进行指定，自回归模型从先前的事件中学习下一个事件的分布。这使得抽样本质上是连续的，限制了效率。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于拒绝抽样的算法

Result: 该方法在真实世界的数据集上展示了经验加速，弥合了大规模TPP应用的表达建模和高效并行生成之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该算法可以在不需要任何架构更改或重新训练的情况下，从现有的TPP模型中并行地精确抽样多个未来值。

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广告竞价的 Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) 模型，考虑了延迟效应、累积效应和客户异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，而准确的广告影响评估需要考虑延迟效应、累积效应和客户异质性，但之前的研究通常没有同时解决这些问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种两阶段最大似然估计器，并结合数据分割策略，以及设计了一种强化学习算法。

Result: 该方法实现了接近最优的遗憾界 $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$。

Conclusion: 仿真实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Motivation: 推测解码被广泛用于加速大型语言模型（LLM）的推理。

Method: 设计了一种算法，该算法可以准确评估所有草稿模型，而不是仅评估所选模型，而不会对目标模型产生额外的查询。

Result: 在开放 LLM 和不同的数据集上进行了大量实验，表明该方法在各种领域显著优于最先进的 EAGLE3 和 BanditSpec 基线，尤其是在需要长推理链时。

Conclusion: 该方法通常适用于任何推测解码方法（单草稿、多草稿和草稿树），并设计了系统高效的在线学习器版本，从而显著降低了计算和延迟方面的开销。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

Motivation: 现有的方法忽略了时间结构，而动态潜变量模型通常仅限于单个区域，假设线性读出，或混合了共享和私有信号。

Method: CTAE采用Transformer编码器和解码器来捕捉长程神经动力学，并显式地将每个区域的潜在空间划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理学数据集上验证了CTAE的有效性，一个来自运动皮层区域，另一个来自感觉区域。与现有方法相比，CTAE提取的有意义的表示能够更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能够有效地提取有意义的表示，更好地解码行为变量。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ShapeX的创新框架，用于解释时间序列分类模型。该框架将时间序列分割成有意义的片段，并使用Shapley值来评估其显著性，从而识别最相关的子序列，提高时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后时间序列解释方法主要关注时间步长级别的特征归因，忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的基本先验。

Method: ShapeX框架的核心是Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) 框架，该框架有效地学习了对分类至关重要的各种shapelet。ShapeX还利用shapelet的原子性属性来揭示因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，ShapeX在识别最相关的子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX能够更精确地识别时间序列分类中的关键子序列，并提供更具因果关系的解释。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自杀风险分类的分层双头神经网络，该网络集成了 CORAL 损失、交叉熵损失和焦点损失，以解决类别不平衡和时间复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台已成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临着严重的类别不平衡、发帖模式的时间复杂性以及风险级别作为有序和分类的双重性质等多重挑战。

Method: 该模型采用基于 MentalRoBERTa 的分层双头神经网络，用于将自杀风险分类为四个级别：指标、意念、行为和尝试。该模型采用在共享序列表示上运行的两个互补预测头：一个保留风险级别之间顺序关系的 CORAL 头，以及一个实现灵活的分类区别的标准分类头。具有 8 头多头注意力的 3 层 Transformer 编码器对跨帖子序列的时间依赖性进行建模，而显式时间间隔嵌入则捕获帖子行为动态。

Result: 该模型使用宏 F1 分数作为主要指标，通过 5 折分层交叉验证进行评估。

Conclusion: 该模型经过训练，具有组合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 焦点损失），可同时解决有序结构保持、过度自信减少和类别不平衡问题。为了提高计算效率，我们冻结了 MentalRoBERTa 的前 6 层（50%）并采用混合精度训练。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的因果发现框架，该框架在保证理论严谨性的同时，实现了与现有方法相媲美的实际性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法要么缺乏有限样本保证，要么难以扩展到大规模图。

Method: 设计了一个基于博弈论的强化学习框架，其中 DDQN 智能体与强大的基线方法（GES 或 GraN-DAG）竞争，并始终从对手的解决方案开始。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据集上，该方法均优于 GES 和 GraN-DAG，同时保持了理论上的安全性。该方法可以扩展到大型图，并在合成 SEM 上观察到的误差概率随 n 衰减，与理论紧密匹配。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一类新的基于强化学习的因果发现算法，该算法同时具有可证明的一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性，标志着在统一经验性能与严格的有限样本理论方面迈出了决定性的一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as

*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加权维度的KNN分类器，通过调整维度权重和距离度量，提高了分类精度，尤其是在高维小样本的基因表达数据集上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在模式分类中，基于维度的加权距离度量是一种重要的考虑因素，但传统的欧氏距离存在许多问题。

Method: 1. 分析了距离度量范数和维度权重的影响，并进行了可视化；2. 提出了一种新的维度加权方案；3. 将该维度加权方案整合到KNN分类器中；4. 在各种合成和真实数据集上进行了模式分类。

Result: 在各种实验中，该模型都表现良好，尤其是在基因表达数据集上，分类精度显著提高（约10%）。

Conclusion: 该模型是加权闵可夫斯基距离KNN分类器的一种重要推广，通过维度加权方案和适当的范数，能够更好地选择近邻样本，从而提高分类精度。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 原型自监督学习方法存在部分原型崩溃问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示。这削弱了它们提供多样化和信息丰富的目标以指导编码器实现丰富表示的核心目的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略，该策略在单独的目标下学习原型和编码器。我们使用在线 EM 风格的程序将原型建模为高斯混合模型，独立于编码器的损失。这种解耦消除了原型崩溃，并产生了一致的多样化原型和更强的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法中，多个原型会收敛到几乎相同的表示，导致原型崩溃。这会削弱它们提供多样化和信息丰富的目标以指导编码器学习丰富表示的目的，并且现有的解决方案（如过度参数化原型集或添加 ad-hoc 正则化器）只是缓解症状，而不是解决根本原因。

Method: 我们提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略，该策略在单独的目标下学习原型和编码器。具体来说，我们将原型建模为高斯混合模型，并使用在线 EM 风格的程序进行更新，该过程独立于编码器的损失。

Result: 这种解耦消除了原型崩溃，并产生了一致的多样化原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦原型和编码器的训练，可以有效避免原型崩溃问题，并提高下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有的时间序列基础模型（TSFM）效果不佳，因为它们直接采用了NLP或CV的流程，而忽略了时间序列数据的特殊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据与图像和文本数据不同，缺乏对常见概念的密集覆盖，导致大规模网络数据抓取方法失效。为了解决这个问题，论文提出应该从机会主义的聚合转向有原则的设计。

Method: 论文建议基于第一性原理构建时间序列不变性的本体，从而系统地覆盖时间序列空间。

Result: 论文认为，只有通过确保不变性覆盖的表征完整性，TSFM才能实现泛化、推理和真正涌现行为所需的对齐结构。

Conclusion: 时间序列基础模型需要通过有原则的数据集设计和不变性覆盖来实现更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型，研究了结构连接（SC）和功能连接（FC）如何相互作用影响Tau蛋白在阿尔茨海默病（AD）中的传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在阐明结构连接（SC）和功能连接（FC）如何相互作用影响Tau蛋白在阿尔茨海默病（AD）中的传播，因为先前研究表明Tau蛋白沿特定脑网络积聚，暗示大脑网络结构在AD进展中起关键作用。

Method: 使用多层图扩散模型，研究SC和FC的相互作用。

Result: 发现连接体结构限制了Tau蛋白的传播，SC和FC对不同脑区的影响不对称。FC主要驱动皮层下区域、脑岛、额叶和颞叶皮层的Tau蛋白传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起较大作用。SC与FC的主导地位随疾病进程而变化，早期AD中FC占主导，而晚期SC成为主要因素。SC和FC主导区域的空间模式与AD相关基因的区域表达密切相关。非可改变风险因素和生物学机制通过在不同脑区解剖和功能通路之间转移主要通路，选择性地重塑Tau蛋白的传播。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，连接体结构限制了Tau蛋白的传播，SC和FC在不同脑区的影响不同，且受疾病进程、遗传风险和生物学机制的影响。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的去中心化学习方法，该方法通过方差减少的随机梯度推送（ADP-VRSGP）实现自适应差分隐私，动态调整噪声方差和学习率，并采用渐进梯度融合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的使用固定方差噪声的方法会降低模型性能并降低训练效率。

Method: 提出 decentralized learning with adaptive differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP)。该方法动态调整噪声方差和学习率，并引入渐进梯度融合策略。

Result: 理论分析表明，ADP-VRSGP在适当的学习率下实现了稳健的收敛，显著提高了训练稳定性和速度。实验结果表明，该方法在多个场景中优于现有的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了隐私保护的去中心化学习的挑战。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HyperNS方法解决大规模TSP问题，该方法通过聚类和超节点抽象来缩小搜索空间，提高优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于神经网络的方法在解决大规模TSP问题时面临内存限制、初始解质量不高以及缺乏全局指导等挑战。

Method: 提出Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) 方法，该方法首先使用稀疏热图将TSP实例划分为簇，然后将其抽象为超节点，生成超旅行来指导初始化和优化过程。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的基于神经网络的方法，尤其是在处理更大规模的实例时，能显著缩小与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过关注与超旅行相关的边，减少了搜索空间，从而实现了更高效和有效的优化。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV: 通过将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数，对大型语言模型（LLM）的优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然具有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）可以使用二元正确性奖励有效地训练目标领域的模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。RLEV 通过将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数来扩展这个框架。

Method: 使用带有明确的 ground-truth 价值标签的考试风格数据，RLEV 在多个 RL 算法和模型规模上始终优于仅以正确性为基线的模型。

Result: RLEV 策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学习了一种价值敏感的终止策略：对于低价值提示简洁，对于高价值提示彻底。我们证明了这种行为源于序列结束 token 的价值加权梯度放大。

Conclusion: RLEV 在嘈杂的价值信号（例如基于难度的标签）下仍然稳健，这表明优化显式效用函数为将 LLM 与人类优先级对齐提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种风险感知的约束强化学习框架，该框架在奖励值和时间上都具有阶段性的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的约束强化学习忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的。

Method: 使用优化的确定性等价物（OCEs）构建了一个风险感知的约束强化学习框架，并基于强拉格朗日对偶性，保证了与原始约束问题完全等价。

Result: 提出了一个简单的算法，可以应用于标准的强化学习求解器（如PPO），并证明了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: 通过数值实验验证了该方法的风险感知特性。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [191] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了PAC学习中可复制性的近似概念，并提出了三种放宽可复制性的方法：逐点、近似和半监督。在前两种情况下，使用$\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$个样本可以免费实现，而第三种情况需要$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$个标记样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可复制性是一种强大的稳定性概念，但成本可能过高。例如，对于像阈值学习这样简单的任务，没有可复制的算法。鉴于如此强大的不可能结果，我们提出问题：在什么近似的可复制性概念下，学习是可能的？

Method: 本文提出了三种PAC学习中可复制性的自然松弛：(1) 逐点：学习者必须在任何固定输入上保持一致，但不能在所有输入上同时保持一致，(2) 近似：学习者必须输出对分布的大部分进行一致分类的假设，(3) 半监督：该算法是完全可复制的，但可能还会使用共享的未标记样本。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，对于恒定的可复制性参数，我们获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)可以使用$\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$个样本“免费”实现，而(3)需要$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$个标记样本。

Conclusion: 本文研究了PAC学习中可复制性的近似概念，并提出了三种放宽可复制性的方法，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用常规实验室数据进行犬类癌症风险分类的可行性，但发现其性能不足以进行临床可靠的区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在兽医学中，开发用于早期癌症检测的易于使用的筛查工具是一项重大挑战。常规实验室数据提供了一个有希望的低成本来源，但其效用受到个体生物标志物的非特异性和筛查人群中固有的严重类别不平衡的阻碍。

Method: 该研究对包含各种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术的 126 个分析流程进行了全面的基准评估。数据在患者层面进行分区以防止泄漏。

Result: 最佳模型（具有类别权重和递归特征消除的 Logistic 回归分类器）表现出中等的排序能力 (AUROC = 0.815)，但临床分类性能较差 (F1-score = 0.25，Positive Predictive Value = 0.15)。

Conclusion: 虽然在常规实验室数据中存在统计上可检测到的癌症信号，但它太弱且混乱，无法与正常衰老或其他炎症疾病进行临床可靠的区分。这项工作为这种数据模式的独立性建立了一个关键的性能上限，并强调计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义进展将需要整合多模态数据源。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CO-PFL的个性化联邦学习算法，该算法通过动态估计每个客户端的贡献来进行全局聚合，并结合参数化个性化机制与mask-aware动量优化，以提高个性化准确性、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构性强的情况下表现不佳，因为它依赖于单一的共识模型，并且其标准的聚合方法未能考虑每个客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优的个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: 本文提出CO-PFL算法，该算法通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来联合评估每个客户端的贡献，利用来自梯度和数据子空间的信息。此外，CO-PFL还集成了参数化个性化机制与mask-aware动量优化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（CIFAR10、CIFAR10C、CINIC10和Mini-ImageNet）上的大量实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化准确性、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL算法通过减轻聚合偏差、加强全局协调和增强局部性能，从而有效地构建具有稳定更新的定制子模型。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将平衡性作为公平性指标的谱聚类算法计算时间较长，需要改进。

Method: 通过使用拉格朗日方法和 Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) 恒等式，重新制定约束优化问题，提出了 Fair-SMW 算法。该算法采用具有不同谱隙的拉普拉斯矩阵的三种替代方案，以生成 Fair-SMW 的多个变体。

Result: Fair-SMW 在计算时间上比最先进的算法快两倍，并且足够灵活，可以实现两倍的平衡性。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW 算法在保证群体公平性的前提下，显著提高了谱聚类算法的效率。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Conclusion: QKCV 是一种有效的注意力机制改进方法，它能够提高时间序列预测的准确性和效率，尤其是在类别信息丰富的场景下。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV

forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习由于客户端之间有限且非独立同分布的数据，面临模型过拟合和发散的挑战。

Method: 引入了一种新的贝叶斯元学习方法MetaVD，通过共享超网络学习预测客户端相关的dropout率，从而在有限的非独立同分布数据设置中实现联邦学习算法的有效模型个性化。强调了元学习的后验适应视角和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合视角。

Result: 在各种稀疏和非独立同分布的联邦学习数据集上进行了大量实验。MetaVD表现出卓越的分类精度和不确定性校准性能，尤其是在分布外客户端方面。MetaVD压缩了每个客户端所需的本地模型参数，从而减轻了模型过拟合并降低了通信成本。

Conclusion: MetaVD方法在联邦学习中能够有效提高模型性能，并降低通信成本。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Motivation: 旨在解决天气变量降尺度问题，利用稀疏气象站和地形数据进行训练。

Method: 使用 SpLIIF 模型，基于日本的气象站和地形数据进行训练。

Result: 在温度降尺度方面，该模型比 CorrDiff 和基线方法提高了 50%，在风力降尺度方面提高了 10-20%。

Conclusion: SpLIIF 模型在天气变量降尺度方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于最大-最小准则的多目标强化学习的框架，该框架具有可证明的收敛性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从博弈论的角度来看，将最大-最小多目标强化学习重新表述为一个双人零和正则化连续博弈。

Method: 介绍了一种基于镜像下降的有效算法，简化了策略更新，同时确保了全局最后一次迭代的收敛性。修改了具有自适应正则化的算法。

Result: 在表格设置中证明了所提算法的收敛行为，并且在许多MORL环境中，深度强化学习的实现明显优于先前的基线。

Conclusion: 为该算法提供了全面的理论分析，包括在精确和近似策略评估下的迭代复杂性，以及样本复杂性界限。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自知识蒸馏方法 Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM)，可以在训练和推理过程中增加可忽略的计算复杂度的同时，提高 GNN 的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高 GNN 的准确性，但增加模型复杂性会导致计算成本和内存需求增加。

Method: 开发 Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM)，通过最小化 GNN 层预先存在的隐藏嵌入之间的平均绝对距离，有效地聚合多跳和多尺度信息，从而改进局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: LKM 方法有效地降低了量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差，最高可达 9.8% (QM9)、45.3% (MD17 Energy) 和 22.9% (Chignolin)。

Conclusion: LKM 有潜力在不显着增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显着提高 GNN 在化学性质预测方面的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

### [200] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 选择性分类器通过在模型认为不确定的输入上选择放弃来提高模型可靠性。这项工作将这种不足形式化为选择性分类差距，并首次将这种差距分解为五个不同的松弛来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实施或由漂移引起的松弛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是现有的选择性分类方法未能达到理想的完美排序的效果。论文旨在分析并缩小选择性分类差距。

Method: 论文提出了一个有限样本分解方法，将选择性分类差距分解为五个来源。通过可控实验，在合成数据和真实数据集上验证了分解。

Result: 结果表明，贝叶斯噪声和有限的模型容量是造成差距的重要原因；更丰富的、特征敏感的校准器可以显著改善得分排序；数据漂移引入了一个单独的松弛，需要分布鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: 论文的分解提供了一个定量的误差预算和可操作的设计指南，从业者可以使用它来构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

*Zhiqin Yang,Yonggang Zhang,Chenxin Li,Yiu-ming Cheung,Bo Han,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 联邦学习(FL)面临着数据异构性的重大挑战，这会损害模型性能和收敛性。本文着眼于现有方法在不同异构场景下的鲁棒性问题，通过综合评估表明，现有方法表现出有限的鲁棒性。因此，本文提出了一种新的框架FedGPS，通过整合来自其他参与者的统计分布和梯度信息来缓解异构性，从而优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在某些异构场景下的性能提升有限，并且在不同异构场景下的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出FedGPS框架，静态地修改每个客户端的学习目标，以隐式地模拟使用替代信息的全局数据分布，同时在每一轮动态地调整具有来自其他客户端的梯度信息的本地更新方向。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedGPS在不同的异构场景中优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS框架能够有效提升联邦学习在数据异构性场景下的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

### [202] [Optimistic Task Inference for Behavior Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20264)
*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 行为基础模型（BFMs）能够在测试时直接检索任何指定奖励函数的高性能策略，通常被称为零样本强化学习（RL）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然在计算方面非常有效，但在数据方面可能效率较低：作为一个标准假设，BFMs需要计算大量推理数据集的奖励，假设可以访问奖励的函数形式或大量的标注工作。为了缓解这些限制，我们致力于仅通过在测试时与环境交互来解决任务推断问题。

Method: 我们提出 OpTI-BFM，这是一种乐观的决策标准，可以直接对奖励函数的不确定性进行建模，并指导 BFM 进行数据收集以进行任务推断。

Result: 从形式上讲，我们通过与线性 bandit 的置信上限算法的直接联系，为训练良好的 BFM 提供了后悔界限。在经验上，我们在已建立的零样本基准上评估 OpTI-BFM，并观察到它使基于后继特征的 BFM 能够在极少的 episode 中识别和优化看不见的奖励函数，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 总结

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

### [203] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 倾向于寻找并利用“捷径”来完成任务，这给LLM的可靠评估和部署带来了重大风险。ImpossibleBench 通过引入自然语言规范和单元测试之间的直接冲突，系统地测量 LLM 代理利用测试用例的倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了量化、研究和减轻这种行为。

Method: ImpossibleBench 创建了来自现有基准（如 LiveCodeBench 和 SWE-bench）的任务的“不可能”变体，通过引入自然语言规范和单元测试之间的直接冲突。

Result: 对模型行为的研究表明，从简单的测试修改到复杂的操作符重载，都存在更细粒度的欺骗行为；上下文工程表明，提示、测试访问和反馈循环会影响作弊率；监控工具的开发提供了一个经过验证的欺骗性解决方案的试验台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench 是一个有用的框架，可以用于构建更强大、更可靠的 LLM 系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler

Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.
