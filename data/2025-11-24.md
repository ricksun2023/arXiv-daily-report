### [1] [Shona spaCy: A Morphological Analyzer for an Under-Resourced Bantu Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16680)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Shona spaCy，一个为班图语Shona开发的开源、基于规则的形态学分析pipeline。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shona语在多语言NLP领域中服务不足，缺乏形态学分析和语言感知工具。

Method: 该系统结合了一个精心设计的JSON词典和语言学规则，以建模名词类前缀、动词主语一致、时态标记、拟声词和附着词，并将它们整合到词条级别的lemma、词性和形态特征的注释中。

Result: 在正式和非正式Shona语料库上的评估结果显示，词性标注准确率为90%，形态特征准确率为88%，同时保持了语言决策的透明性。

Conclusion: Shona spaCy通过桥接描述性语法和计算实现，提高了Shona语使用者的NLP可访问性和数字包容性，并为其他资源不足的班图语的形态学分析工具提供了一个模板。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multilingual natural language processing (NLP), the Bantu language Shona remains under-served in terms of morphological analysis and language-aware tools. This paper presents Shona spaCy, an open-source, rule-based morphological pipeline for Shona built on the spaCy framework. The system combines a curated JSON lexicon with linguistically grounded rules to model noun-class prefixes (Mupanda 1-18), verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics, integrating these into token-level annotations for lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological features. The toolkit is available via pip install shona-spacy, with source code at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/shona-spacy and a PyPI release at https://pypi.org/project/shona-spacy/0.1.4/. Evaluation on formal and informal Shona corpora yields 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy, while maintaining transparency in its linguistic decisions. By bridging descriptive grammar and computational implementation, Shona spaCy advances NLP accessibility and digital inclusion for Shona speakers and provides a template for morphological analysis tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.

### [2] [Towards Hyper-Efficient RAG Systems in VecDBs: Distributed Parallel Multi-Resolution Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16681)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多分辨率向量索引框架，名为语义金字塔索引（SPI），用于改进RAG系统中向量数据库的检索效率和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的向量数据库检索管道依赖于扁平或单分辨率索引结构，无法适应不同用户查询所需的不同语义粒度，导致检索速度和上下文相关性之间的权衡不佳。

Method: SPI在文档嵌入上构建一个语义金字塔，并通过一个轻量级分类器动态选择每个查询的最佳分辨率级别。这种自适应方法能够从粗到精逐步检索，从而显著加速搜索，同时保持语义覆盖。

Result: SPI在多个RAG任务中实现了高达5.7倍的检索速度提升和1.8倍的内存效率提升，同时端到端QA F1分数提高了高达2.5个点。

Conclusion: SPI与现有向量数据库基础设施兼容，使其易于在生产RAG系统中部署。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems. Code is availabe at \href{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI_VecDB}{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI\_VecDB}.

### [3] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bench360 is a benchmarking tool for local LLM inference that helps users find the optimal configuration for their needs by considering both system and task-specific metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM inference benchmarks are too narrow and not user-focused, failing to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics.

Method: Bench360 allows users to define custom tasks, datasets, and metrics, and then automatically benchmarks LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios. It tracks system metrics (e.g., latency, energy) and task-specific metrics (e.g., ROUGE, F1 score).

Result: The authors demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks, revealing trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency. The results show that there is no single best setup for local inference.

Conclusion: The need for a framework such as Bench360 is strongly motivated by the lack of a single best setup for local LLM inference. Bench360 helps bridge the gap in the existing benchmarks .

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [4] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Tunisian Arabic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16683)
*Mohamed Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在理解低资源语言（如突尼斯阿拉伯语）方面常被忽视，这会威胁到突尼斯语的保护，并可能影响年轻一代。本研究引入了一个包含平行语料的数据集，并在三个任务上评估了多个LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前工业级LLM对低资源语言的理解不足，可能导致数百万人无法用自己的语言与AI互动，从而威胁到突尼斯语的传承和文化认同。

Method: 构建了一个包含突尼斯阿拉伯语、标准突尼斯阿拉伯语和英语平行翻译以及情感标签的新数据集，并在音译、翻译和情感分析三个任务上对多个流行的LLM进行了基准测试。

Result: 实验结果揭示了不同模型在理解和处理突尼斯方言方面的显著差异，突出了它们的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过量化这些差距，强调了在下一代AI系统中包含低资源语言的重要性，以确保技术的可访问性、包容性和文化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [5] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的开放意图分类方法，该方法通过学习椭球决策边界来提高开放意图检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设已知类别的各向同性分布，限制了边界为球形，忽略了沿不同方向的分布方差。

Method: 1) 采用监督对比学习获得已知样本的判别特征空间。2) 应用可学习矩阵参数化椭球作为每个已知类的边界。3) 通过新设计的双重损失函数优化边界，平衡经验和开放空间风险。

Result: 在多个文本意图基准测试和一个问题分类数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 椭球的灵活性证明了卓越的开放意图检测能力和推广到更多样化的复杂开放世界场景中的文本分类任务的强大潜力。

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

### [6] [AutoLink: Autonomous Schema Exploration and Expansion for Scalable Schema Linking in Text-to-SQL at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17190)
*Ziyang Wang,Yuanlei Zheng,Zhenbiao Cao,Xiaojin Zhang,Zhongyu Wei,Pei Fu,Zhenbo Luo,Wei Chen,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AutoLink的自主代理框架，用于解决工业级文本到SQL中schema linking的问题，该框架通过迭代和代理驱动的方式动态探索和扩展schema子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有schema linking方法成本高昂，难以平衡召回率和噪声，且难以扩展到大型数据库。

Method: AutoLink通过LLM引导，动态探索和扩展链接的schema子集，逐步识别必要的schema组件，而无需输入完整的数据库schema。

Result: AutoLink在Bird-Dev和Spider-2.0-Lite上实现了最先进的严格schema linking召回率，分别为97.4%和91.2%，并且具有竞争力的执行准确率。AutoLink在大型schemas上表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: AutoLink是一种高度可扩展、高召回率的schema-linking解决方案，适用于工业文本到SQL系统。

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

### [7] [Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688)
*Giulio Antonio Abbo,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估提示候选是否能有效引导生成文本符合特定人类价值观的实用、可复现且与模型无关的程序，形式化了一种评分方法来量化生成响应中目标价值观的存在和增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地应用于与人类价值观对齐至关重要的应用中。微调模型通常用于确保安全响应，但这种技术是静态的，不适用于涉及动态价值观和偏好的日常情况。

Method: 使用Schwartz的基本人类价值观理论和一个通过对话数据集进行的结构化评估，将该方法应用于Wizard-Vicuna语言模型的一个变体。将基线提示与明确以价值观为条件的提示进行比较。

Result: 即使不改变模型或动态优化提示，价值观引导也是可能的。

Conclusion: 展示了价值观引导是可能的，即使不改变模型或动态优化提示。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [8] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于概念的毒性检测解释方法，并提出了一种基于概念梯度（CG）的解释技术，以更准确地衡量概念变化对模型输出的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络的兴起导致有害内容的传播，而对毒性检测中基于概念的解释探索仍然有限。

Method: 1. 利用毒性检测数据集中的子类型属性（如淫秽、威胁、侮辱等）作为概念。
2. 提出基于概念梯度（CG）的解释技术，衡量概念变化对模型输出的影响。
3. 提出Targeted Lexicon Set，捕捉导致文本分类模型错误分类的毒性词语。
4. 计算Word-Concept Alignment (WCA)分数，量化这些词语因过度归因于毒性概念而导致错误的程度。
5. 引入无词汇增强策略，生成排除预定义毒性词汇集的毒性样本。

Result: 通过引入Targeted Lexicon Set和计算WCA分数，可以评估词汇集在错误分类中的重要性。提出的无词汇增强策略能够深入了解模型对更广泛的毒性语言模式的归因。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于概念的毒性检测解释方法，并引入了一系列技术来识别和减轻由于概念过度归因导致的分类错误，从而提高了毒性检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [9] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI检测模型容易将润色过的人工文章误判为AI生成，尤其是在阿拉伯语文章中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI检测模型在区分人工撰写和AI生成的文章时存在局限性，尤其是在面对AI润色过的人工文章时，可能导致误判，损害AI检测模型的信誉。且现有研究多集中于英语，缺乏阿拉伯语的研究。

Method: 1. 构建包含800篇阿拉伯语文章的数据集，评估14个大型语言模型和商业AI检测器区分人工和AI生成文章的能力。
2. 选择8个最佳模型，构建Ar-APT数据集，包含400篇人工文章，由10个LLM使用4种润色设置进行润色，共生成16400个样本。
3. 使用Ar-APT数据集评估这8个模型，确定轻微润色是否会影响其性能。

Result: 所有AI检测器都错误地将大量润色后的文章归因于AI生成。性能最佳的LLM Claude-4 Sonnet的准确率从83.51%下降到57.63%（被LLaMA-3润色）。Originality.AI的准确率从92%下降到12%（被Mistral或Gemma-3润色）。

Conclusion: AI检测器容易受到AI润色的影响，导致误判。

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

### [10] [Reproducibility Report: Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16691)
*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文重现了 Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024) 的核心论点，即通过在检索到的最近邻序列上进行微调来在推理时调整语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证在测试时训练中，模型如何在不同领域和数据集上提高性能，并探讨其对不同预训练模型的影响。

Method: 使用 Faiss 索引的预训练 RoBERTa 嵌入，检索每个测试输入 20 个邻居，并对 GPT-2、GPT-Neo 和 R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B 应用每个邻居一个梯度更新。

Result: 测试时训练显著降低了 The Pile 中不同领域的困惑度和每字节位数指标，在 GitHub 和 EuroParl 等结构化或专业数据集中改进最大。未在 The Pile 上预训练的模型从此适应中受益更多，允许较小的模型接近较大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持最近邻测试时训练的稳健性和通用性，同时强调了重现大规模检索增强适应的实际考虑因素。

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

### [11] [How Language Directions Align with Token Geometry in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16693)
*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究深入探讨了多语言大型语言模型（LLMs）中语言信息的内部结构，以及这种结构如何在不同层中形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多语言LLMs在多种语言上表现出色，但对其内部表征空间中语言信息的结构化方式，以及这种结构如何在层间涌现的系统性分析仍然有限。

Method: 我们对六个多语言LLMs的所有268个transformer层进行了全面的探测研究，使用线性和非线性探针，以及新的Token-Language Alignment分析，以量化语言编码的层间动态和几何结构。

Result: 研究结果表明，语言信息在第一个transformer块中迅速分离（从第0层到第1层增加+76.4$\%\pm$8.2个百分点），并在整个模型深度中几乎保持完全线性可分。我们还发现，语言方向和词汇嵌入之间的对齐与训练数据的语言组成密切相关。值得注意的是，包含中文的模型达到了16.43\%的ZH Match@Peak，而以英语为中心的模型仅达到3.90\%，揭示了4.21$\times$的结构印记效应。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，多语言LLMs区分语言不是通过表面脚本特征，而是通过由训练语料库塑造的潜在表征结构。我们的分析为多语言表征学习中的数据组成策略和公平性提供了实践见解。

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning. All code and analysis scripts are publicly available at: https://github.com/thisiskorea/How-Language-Directions-Align-with-Token-Geometry-in-Multilingual-LLMs.

### [12] [Hierarchical Retrieval with Out-Of-Vocabulary Queries: A Case Study on SNOMED CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16698)
*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语言模型的本体嵌入方法，用于解决SNOMED CT中OOV查询的分层概念检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNOMED CT中的知识检索对于其应用至关重要，但由于语言歧义、同义词、多义词等问题，检索具有挑战性。当查询是词汇表外(OOV)时，问题会更加严重。

Method: 提出了一种基于语言模型的本体嵌入方法。

Result: 该方法优于包括SBERT和两种词汇匹配方法在内的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可以扩展到其他本体。

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

### [13] [Detecting and Steering LLMs' Empathy in Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16699)
*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究调查了LLM激活空间中，将同理心付诸行动（牺牲任务效率以满足人类需求）作为一个线性方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解和操纵LLM中的同理心行为。

Method: 使用基于Empathy-in-Action (EIA)基准的对比提示，测试了Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (安全训练), 和 Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (未审查) 模型的检测和引导能力。

Result: 所有模型在最佳层显示AUROC 0.996-1.00。Qwen在双向控制下达到65.3%的成功率，Phi-3达到61.7%。Dolphin在亲同理心引导下表现出94.4%的成功率，但在反同理心引导下出现灾难性崩溃。Phi-3 probes与EIA行为评分高度相关 (r=0.71, p<0.01)。

Conclusion: 检测-引导差距因模型而异。Qwen和Phi-3保持双向一致性；Dolphin仅在同理心增强方面显示出鲁棒性。安全训练可能会影响引导鲁棒性，而不是防止操纵。

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate code from Bangla instructions.

Method: A multi-agent pipeline with a code-generation agent and a debugger agent.

Result: Achieved first place with a Pass@1 score of 95.4.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for code generation from Bangla instructions. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的翻译思维ABC框架，该框架基于扩展思维（EM）理论和激进具身认知，将翻译视为一种动态整合情感、行为和认知（ABC）过程的具身活动，而非对静态的语际对应的操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨表征性思维模型的替代方案。

Method: 本文提出了翻译思维的ABC框架，并结合预测处理和(En)Active Inference，论证了翻译者的思维是通过大脑-身体-环境互动的循环而涌现的。

Result: 本文将翻译重新定义为对社会文化实践的熟练参与，其中意义是通过与文本、工具和环境的具身互动实时共同创造的。

Conclusion: 本文对翻译的非表征性解释为理解翻译过程提供了一个新的视角。

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了非及物动词的句法分类（主动动词和非宾格动词）与语义属性（主动性和有界性）之间的关系。之前的研究发现，人类对主动性和有界性的评级不能很好地预测非及物动词的句法行为。这篇论文通过从主动和有界量表的两极选取的种子词计算可解释的维度，重新探讨了这个问题。研究结果表明，主动/非宾格与主动性/有界性之间存在联系，并且使用可解释的维度与人类判断相结合可以为语义属性提供有价值的证据。

Motivation: 先前的研究发现，人类对主动性和有界性的评级不能很好地预测非及物动词的句法行为。

Method: 通过从主动和有界量表的两极选取的种子词计算可解释的维度。

Result: 研究结果支持主动/非宾格与主动性/有界性之间存在联系。

Conclusion: 使用可解释的维度与人类判断相结合可以为语义属性提供有价值的证据。

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

TL;DR: PEPPER是一种防御文本到图像扩散模型后门攻击的方法，它通过将标题重写为语义上不同但视觉上相似的标题，同时添加不显眼的元素来扰乱嵌入在输入提示中的触发器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，输入提示中的触发器会将生成导向有害或非预期的内容。

Method: PEPPER通过重写标题，将其转换为语义上较远但视觉上相似的标题，并添加不显眼的元素来扰乱触发器。

Result: 实验表明，PEPPER能有效对抗基于文本编码器的攻击，显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持生成质量。PEPPER还可以与任何现有防御方法配对，产生比任何独立方法更强大和更具通用性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEPPER是一种有效的后门防御方法，它通过扰乱输入提示中的触发器，提高文本到图像扩散模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的、无需参考的指标来评估大型语言模型生成响应的简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常生成冗长且verbose的响应，降低了清晰度和用户满意度，并增加了模型开发者的成本。

Method: 该方法量化了非必要内容，不依赖于黄金标准参考，并计算三个计算的平均值：i) 原始响应和LLM抽象摘要之间的压缩率；ii) 原始响应和LLM提取摘要之间的压缩率；iii) 词语删除压缩，其中LLM从响应中删除尽可能多的非必要词语，同时保留其含义，删除的token数量表示简洁性得分。

Result: 实验结果表明，该指标可以识别LLM输出中的冗余。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动评估会话AI系统中响应的简洁性提供了一种实用的工具，无需人工标注。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

### [19] [Improving Latent Reasoning in LLMs via Soft Concept Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16885)
*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通常通过生成离散的 tokens 进行推理，这限制了它们的表达能力。为了弥补推理中软概念和训练中离散 tokens 之间的差距，论文提出了软概念混合（SCM）方法，这是一种软概念感知训练方案，可以在训练期间直接将模型暴露于软表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 通常通过生成离散 tokens 进行推理，这限制了它们的表达能力。软思考 (Soft Thinking) 表明，LLM 通过软概念进行潜在推理是一个有希望的方向，但 LLM 是在离散 tokens 上训练的。

Method: SCM 通过形成概率加权平均的嵌入来构建软概念向量。然后，将该向量混合到模型的隐藏状态中，这些隐藏状态包含丰富的上下文信息。最后，使用强化学习 (RL) 优化整个潜在推理过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准上的实验表明，SCM 提高了 LLM 的推理性能，同时保持了稳定的训练动态。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的软概念混合（SCM）方法，可以提高 LLM 的推理能力，为 LLM 的训练提供了一个新的思路。

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

Motivation: 如何以最小的改动进一步提高这些方法的效率？

Method: 将TRM的潜在推理构建为一种无分类器引导和隐式策略改进算法，并提出一种新的训练方案，为训练期间的每个循环提供目标。

Result: 该方法将前向传播的总数减少了18倍，并消除了停止机制，同时保持了与标准TRM相当的质量。在ARC-1上以仅0.8M的参数实现了24%的准确率，优于大多数LLM。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了训练效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

Motivation: 精确描述归纳头的形成仍然不清楚

Method: 研究了训练数据的统计特性（包括自然数据和合成数据）与 IH 形成之间的关系

Result: (1) 一个结合了批量大小和上下文大小的简单公式可以预测 IH 形成的时刻；(2) 表面二元语重复频率和可靠性强烈影响 IH 的形成，并且在这两个值方面找到了精确的帕累托前沿；(3) 具有高二元语重复频率和可靠性的局部依赖性足以形成 IH，但是当频率和可靠性较低时，类别性和边际分布的形状很重要。

Conclusion: 揭示了训练数据统计特性对归纳头形成的影响

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

Motivation: 现有的文本摘要研究忽略了在线对话的论证性质，并且未能解释句子中更深层次的论证结构。

Method: 本文提出了ARQUSUMM框架，该框架利用LLM小样本学习来识别句子中的命题及其claim-reason关系，并采用论证结构感知的聚类算法来聚合论点并量化其支持。

Result: 实验表明，ARQUSUMM优于现有的对话和定量摘要模型，并生成代表论证结构的摘要，这些摘要对用户更有帮助，具有更高的文本质量和量化准确性。

Conclusion: ARQUSUMM框架能够有效地揭示在线对话中的论证结构，并生成高质量的定量摘要。

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

Motivation: 利用大语言模型和知识图谱在文化遗产研究中潜力巨大，但湖南历史名人数据资源有限，通用模型表现不佳。

Method: 1. 设计schema-guided instruction template，构建instruction-tuning数据集。 2. 对Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct四个开源大模型进行参数高效的instruction fine-tuning。 3. 建立评估标准以评估模型的提取性能。

Result: 所有模型在微调后性能均显著提升，其中Qwen3-8B效果最佳，在100个样本和50次训练迭代后，得分达到89.3866。

Conclusion: 本研究为区域历史文化领域垂直大模型的微调提供了新思路，并突出了其在文化遗产知识提取和知识图谱构建中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在理解视觉说服力方面的能力，因为现有模型在这方面的能力尚不清楚。

Method: 构建了一个用于二元说服力判断的数据集，并引入了视觉说服因素（VPF）的分类，包括低级感知、中级组合和高级语义线索。同时，探索了认知引导和知识注入策略。

Result: 视觉语言模型表现出一种以召回为导向的偏差，即模型过度预测高说服力，并且对低/中级特征的区分能力较弱。消息和对象存在之间的高级语义对齐是人类判断的最强预测指标。简单的指令或无引导的推理支架产生边际或负面影响，而简洁的、以对象为基础的理由显著提高了精度和 F1 分数。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的核心局限性不在于识别有说服力的对象，而在于将它们与交流意图联系起来。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的自动评分框架AnalyticScore，该框架在保持较高评分准确率的同时，提高了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏被广泛接受的、可用于大规模真实评估的可解释的自动评分解决方案。

Method: 1) 提取response中明确的可识别元素；2) 使用LLM将每个response特征化为人类可解释的值；3) 应用直观的序数逻辑回归模型进行评分。

Result: AnalyticScore在评分准确率上优于许多不可解释的评分方法，并且在ASAP-SAS数据集的10个项目上的平均QWK仅比不可解释的SOTA低0.06。AnalyticScore的特征化行为与人类的特征化行为非常吻合。

Conclusion: 本文为短答案评分开发了AnalyticScore框架，为未来的研究提供了一个基准参考框架，并提出了可解释性的四个原则 -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI)。

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

Motivation: 现有的LLM缺乏可靠性，声明层面的UQ是一种有前景的缓解方法。之前的基准依赖于人工或LLM进行分割，耗时较多

Method: 设计了一个新的确定性算法来分割声明，该算法只需LLM生成时间的0.2%。发布每个token的24个生成logits，以促进未来白盒方法的发展

Result: 构建了一个包含四种欧洲语言和四个指令调整开放权重LLM的包含4,873个样本的数据集。评估表明，目前的方法在性能和效率方面仍有很大的改进空间

Conclusion: MUCH是第一个声明层面的UQ基准，专为在实际条件下公平和可重复地评估未来方法而设计。

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AMD 硬件、网络和软件堆栈对于有竞争力的大规模预训练来说已经足够成熟和优化。

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

Result: 实验表明，精心设计的压缩目标可以显著增强基于 LLM 的文本表示，优于使用 token 级别预训练任务训练的模型。通过对比学习进一步改进后，产生了一个强大的表示模型 (LLM2Comp)，在各种任务上优于现有的基于 LLM 的文本编码器，同时更具样本效率，需要更少的训练数据。

Conclusion: 本文证明了上下文压缩作为预训练任务，可以有效提升 LLM 的文本表示能力，并且通过对比学习可以进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的、大规模的、多语种的自动后编辑（APE）数据集LangMark，用于改进机器翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动后编辑系统由于缺乏针对神经机器翻译（NMT）输出的大规模多语种数据集而受到限制。

Method: 创建了一个包含206,983个三元组的数据集，每个三元组包含源片段、NMT输出和人工后编辑翻译，由专业的语言学家进行注释。

Result: 利用该数据集，实验表明，通过少量样本提示，大型语言模型（LLM）可以有效地执行APE，优于领先的商业和专有机器翻译系统。

Conclusion: 新的LangMark数据集将促进APE系统的未来发展和评估。

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）经常产生流畅但事实不正确的回答，即幻觉。弃权是一种常见的保障措施，模型选择不回答，而是输出“我不知道”等短语。然而，现有的弃权方法通常依赖于生成后的信号，例如生成变异或反馈，这限制了它们预先阻止不可靠响应的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会产生幻觉，并且现有方法依赖于生成后的信号，这限制了它们预先阻止不可靠响应的能力。

Method: 本文介绍了一种新的基于方面的因果弃权（ABCA）框架，该框架通过因果推理分析LLM知识的内部多样性来实现早期弃权。ABCA 估计以这些方面为条件的因果效应，以评估与给定查询相关的知识的可靠性。基于这些估计，我们启用了两种类型的弃权：类型 1，其中方面效应不一致（知识冲突），以及类型 2，其中方面效应始终支持弃权（知识不足）。

Result: 在标准基准上的实验表明，ABCA 提高了弃权的可靠性，实现了最先进的性能，并增强了弃权决策的可解释性。

Conclusion: ABCA 是一种新的框架，通过因果推理分析 LLM 知识的内部多样性来实现早期弃权，并且在标准基准上的实验表明，ABCA 提高了弃权的可靠性，实现了最先进的性能，并增强了弃权决策的可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合统计和语义特征的Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) 模型，用于新闻文本分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法侧重统计特征但忽略上下文，深度学习方法侧重语义特征但忽略统计指标。

Method: 使用注意力机制动态确定每种特征类型的重要性，从而结合统计和语义特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上，AGFF 模型优于传统统计模型和纯语义深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 战略性地整合多种特征类型可以显著提高分类准确率。

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有的层剪枝方法难以同时解决性能下降、训练成本高和加速有限等实际部署挑战。

Method: 采用了一种可微分的掩码优化方法，使用Gumbel-TopK采样器，并提出了一种熵感知自适应知识蒸馏策略。

Result: 在各种模型架构和基准测试中，该方法都优于现有技术。在MATH-500上，当剪枝Qwen3-32B的25%层时，达到了96%的准确率，仅比原始模型下降0.8%，优于现有的SOTA。

Conclusion: 该框架在任务有效性、训练经济性和推理效率方面都具有优势。

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件中心的新方法，以改进LLM驱动的对话代理在多轮对话中的连贯性和个性化，通过将对话历史表示为包含参与者、时间信息和局部上下文的事件样命题，并构建异构图来支持关联回忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM对话代理在保持长期对话的连贯性和个性化方面存在困难，主要是由于固定上下文窗口的限制和外部记忆方法需要在粗略检索和细粒度碎片化视图之间进行权衡。

Method: 将对话历史分解为富含信息的初级话语单元（EDU），这些单元是包含规范化实体和来源信息的独立语句，并将对话session、EDU及其参数组织在一个异构图中，以支持关联回忆。在此基础上，构建了两个简单的基于检索的变体，使用密集相似性搜索和LLM过滤，并可选择使用基于图的传播步骤来连接和聚合相关EDU之间的证据。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval$_S$基准测试上的实验表明，这种基于事件中心的记忆方法可以与强大的基线相匹配或超过它们，同时使用更短的QA上下文。

Conclusion: 结构简单、事件级别的记忆为长期对话代理提供了一个原则性和实用的基础。

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在权威和说服的社会压力下，准确性降低的问题，即过度顺从现象。

Method: 通过双盲评估比较中性问题和权威性错误问题，量化置信度变化，并使用八态行为分类系统对失败模式进行分类。

Result: 高级模型表现出较低的“跟随率”和最小的准确性损失，而较旧/较小的模型表现出严重的认知崩溃。较弱的模型会降低对正确答案的信心，同时增加对错误的答案的信心。国际法和全球知识领域表现出高度脆弱性，而初等数学相对有弹性。

Conclusion: 抵抗过度拟合压力应与准确性、避免伤害和隐私一起，作为在现实世界中安全部署的首要目标。

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM在表格问答任务上的评估未能捕捉到真实场景的复杂性，现有数据集的局限性导致研究与实践之间存在差距。

Method: 提出了MirageTVQA基准数据集，包含多语言和具有视觉噪声的表格。

Result: 对领先的VLM的评估表明，模型在面对视觉噪声时性能下降超过35%，并且存在英语优先的偏见。

Conclusion: MirageTVQA提供了一个基准，用于测量和推动更强大的VLM模型在表格推理方面的进展。

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning. The dataset and the code are available at: https://github.com/anshulsc/MirageTVQA.

Motivation: 理解和预测社交媒体用户行为对于内容推荐和平台设计至关重要，但现有方法主要关注常见的转发和点赞等行为，而对罕见但重要的行为的预测却鲜有探索。

Method: 该方法结合了四种互补的方法：基于历史响应模式的查找数据库系统；具有时间和语义特征的，用于常见行为的Persona-Specific LightGBM模型；融合文本和时间表示的，用于罕见行为分类的混合神经架构；以及文本回复的生成。

Result: Persona-Specific模型在常见行为预测中实现了0.64的平均Macro F1-score，而罕见行为分类器在10个罕见行为中实现了0.56的Macro F1-score。

Conclusion: 有效的社交媒体行为预测需要定制的建模策略，能够识别行为类型之间的根本差异。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

Motivation: 在多语言社区中，情感分析系统可用于快速识别社交媒体帖子中的社会挑战，使政府部门能够更准确有效地检测和解决这些问题。目前还没有工作研究利用LLM对南非语言的社交媒体帖子进行情感分析并检测社会挑战。

Method: 分析了最先进的LLM GPT-3.5、GPT-4、LlaMa 2、PaLM 2和Dolly 2的零样本性能，以研究10个南非政府部门管辖范围内，英语、Sepedi和Setswana社交媒体帖子中10个最热门话题的情感极性。

Result: 结果表明，各种LLM、主题和语言之间存在很大差异。此外，不同LLM结果的融合在情感分类性能方面提供了很大的提升，情感分类误差低于1%。

Conclusion: 现在可以提供生成关于情感分析的可靠信息的系统，以检测社会挑战，并得出关于特定主题和不同语言群体中可能需要采取行动的结论。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统主要针对一对一场景，缺乏在多人异步群聊中自然交互的能力。为了提高用户信任和参与度，开发自然和人性化的交互模式至关重要。

Method: HUMA采用事件驱动架构，包含Router、Action Agent和Reflection三个组件，以适应群聊动态。

Result: 在四人角色扮演聊天中，参与者难以区分HUMA和人类社区管理者。主观体验方面，两者在有效性、社交存在感和参与度/满意度上差异不大。

Conclusion: AI引导者在自然群聊环境中可以达到人类水平，且难以被识别为非人类。

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究词义对普通话单音节词音高轮廓的影响。

Method: 使用广义加性模型将观察到的音高轮廓分解为一组与不同控制变量和语义预测因子相关的分量音高轮廓。

Result: 即使控制了词长、性别、说话人身份、声调语境、元音高度和语段位置等变量，词义的影响仍然是声调实现的一个强预测因子。词义比词本身是更好的预测因子，并且异形同音词具有不同的音高轮廓。从语境化嵌入中预测单个词的音高轮廓的准确性大大超过了排列基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果与区分性词典模型的理论框架非常吻合。

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

*Daniil Ignatev,Ayman Santeer,Albert Gatt,Denis Paperno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本自然语言推理(NLI)方法，通过将语言置于视觉语境中，利用多模态表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自然语言推理中存在的文本偏差和表面启发式问题，提高模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用文本到图像模型生成前提的视觉表示，并通过比较这些表示与文本假设进行推理。使用了余弦相似度和视觉问答两种推理技术。

Result: 无需特定任务的微调即可实现高精度，证明了该方法对文本偏差和表面启发式的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 利用视觉模态作为意义表示为鲁棒的自然语言理解提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的位置编码方法 Selective RoPE，它是一种输入相关的旋转嵌入机制，可以推广 RoPE，并为线性 transformers 和 softmax transformers 实现任意角度的旋转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置信息对于语言建模至关重要。现有的位置编码方法或者依赖固定角度旋转（RoPE），或者依赖输入相关的门控机制来处理顺序。

Method: 提出了 Selective RoPE，一种输入相关的旋转嵌入机制，它可以推广 RoPE，并为线性 transformers 和 softmax transformers 实现任意角度的旋转。

Result: 通过在门控 transformers 中配备 Selective RoPE，证明了其输入相关的旋转可以提高语言建模以及复制、状态跟踪和检索等困难序列任务的性能。

Conclusion: Selective RoPE 能够有效提高语言建模和序列任务的性能，因为它是一种输入相关的旋转嵌入机制，可以推广 RoPE，并为线性 transformers 和 softmax transformers 实现任意角度的旋转。

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

### [45] [Beyond Multiple Choice: A Hybrid Framework for Unifying Robust Evaluation and Verifiable Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17405)
*Yesheng Liu,Hao Li,Haiyu Xu,Baoqi Pei,Jiahao Wang,Mingxuan Zhao,Jingshu Zheng,Zheqi He,JG Yao,Bowen Qin,Xi Yang,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多项选择题问答（MCQA）在评估和强化微调多模态语言模型中被广泛使用，但选项可能泄露可利用的信号，导致准确率指标不可靠。我们提出了ReVeL框架，将多项选择题改写为开放式问题，同时保持答案的可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题问答（MCQA）的准确率指标可能因为选项泄露而不可靠，并且鼓励在强化微调期间进行显式或隐式的答案猜测行为。

Method: ReVeL框架根据不同的答案类型对问题进行分类，并应用不同的改写和验证方案。使用GRPO对Qwen2.5-VL模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个选择基准测试中，ReVeL-OpenQA训练的模型与MCQA的准确率相匹配，并且OpenQA的准确率提高了约6个百分点。ReVeL还揭示了MCQA基准测试中高达20个百分点的分数膨胀。

Conclusion: ReVeL框架提高了数据效率和更强大的奖励信号，并且在评估中，ReVeL提高了判断准确率，并降低了成本和延迟。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

*Shrikant Kendre,Austin Xu,Honglu Zhou,Michael Ryoo,Shafiq Joty,Juan Carlos Niebles*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMILE: A new metric for evaluating question answering tasks that combines sentence-level and keyword-level semantics with keyword matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for question answering tasks have limitations in capturing deeper semantic understanding and balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics. LLM-based evaluators have drawbacks like high costs, bias, and inconsistency.

Method: A composite method that balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation.

Result: SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight across text, image, and video QA tasks.

Conclusion: SMILE bridges the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation by combining sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching.

Abstract: Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.

*Zhen Wang,Zhifeng Gao,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-RLVR通过掩码和重排序中间推理步骤，从中间推理中提取可学习的信号，从而增强了RLVR在数学推理中的可扩展性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在数学推理方面表现出了一定的能力，但对于定理证明等任务，由于中间推理过程的关键性和最终答案难以直接验证，RLVR的可扩展性受到限制。同时，token-level的监督微调容易导致死记硬背。

Method: 提出了MR-RLVR，它通过“掩码然后填充”和“步骤重排序”构建过程级的自监督奖励，从中间推理中提取可学习的信号。该训练流程包括两个阶段：首先对采样的数学计算和证明数据进行自监督训练；然后对只有结果可验证的数学计算数据集进行RLVR微调。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上实施了MR-RLVR，并在AIME24、AIME25、AMC23和MATH500上进行了评估。在固定的采样和解码预算下，MR-RLVR相对于原始RLVR，Pass@1提高了+9.86%，Pass@5提高了+5.27%，Pass@8提高了+4.00%。

Conclusion: 将过程感知的自监督信号纳入其中，可以有效地提高RLVR在只有结果可验证的设置中的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

TL;DR: 本研究利用拓扑数据分析中的持续同调方法，对艺术风格进行客观和可解释的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，艺术风格的识别依赖于艺术史学家或评论家的视觉直觉和经验。为了能够通过更结构化的视角探索艺术，从而识别艺术风格。

Method: 使用持续同调（PH）方法。

Result: 研究表明，PH 能够以统计确定性区分不同艺术流派和同一流派的艺术家，并且能够区分艺术家创作的图像与人工智能生成的具有该艺术家风格的图像。

Conclusion: 持续同调方法为艺术风格的识别提供了客观和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

### [49] [A Little More Like This: Text-to-Image Retrieval with Vision-Language Models Using Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17255)
*Bulat Khaertdinov,Mirela Popa,Nava Tintarev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受传统文本搜索启发的机制，以提高推理时检索性能：相关性反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型视觉语言模型(VLM)的性能通常需要微调和扩展到更大的模型变体。

Method: 提出了四种基于VLM的检索反馈策略，包括伪相关反馈(PRF)、生成相关反馈(GRF)和注意力反馈摘要(AFS)。

Result: 在Flickr30k和COCO上的实验表明，GRF、AFS和显式反馈使较小VLM的MRR@5的检索性能提高了3-5%，而较大的VLM的检索性能提高了1-3%。

Conclusion: 相关性反馈可以持续增强VLM的检索，并为交互式和自适应视觉搜索开辟机会。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动物面部表情图像数据有限，尤其是在个体面部表情方面。猕猴在系统神经科学和进化研究中被广泛研究，因此是研究对象。

Method: 1) 使用动作迁移合成新的面部表情图像进行数据增强；2) 基于 StyleGAN2 模型的潜在表征进行样本选择，确保训练数据集的多样性和均匀采样；3) 改进损失函数，确保准确再现细微的运动，如眼部运动。

Result: 该方法能够为多个猕猴个体生成不同的面部表情，优于仅在原始静态图像上训练的模型。该模型可有效地进行基于风格的图像编辑，其中特定的风格参数对应于不同的面部运动。

Conclusion: 该模型具有将运动成分分解为风格参数的潜力，为猕猴面部表情研究提供了一种有价值的工具。

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences.

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

Conclusion: 发布了SAM 3以及新的Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co)基准测试，用于promptable concept segmentation。

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

TL;DR: 通过微调来提高视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的安全性的方法，通常会以牺牲其泛化性能为代价。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种邻近感知方法：将不安全的概念重定向到语义上最接近的安全替代方案，以最大限度地减少表征变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的安全性通常会以牺牲其泛化性能为代价。

Method: 我们提出SaFeR-CLIP，这是一个应用最小干预原则的微调框架，将不安全的概念重定向到语义上最接近的安全替代方案，以最大限度地减少表征变化。

Result: SaFeR-CLIP成功地兼顾了安全性和性能，与之前的方法相比，在保持强大安全性的同时，zero-shot 准确率提高了 8.0%。

Conclusion: 尊重预训练表征的几何结构是在不牺牲性能的情况下实现安全性的关键。

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种从单视图SVG生成多视图一致性SVG的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对于单对象SVG，从单视图输入生成多视图一致性SVG的研究不足。

Method: 该框架分为三个阶段：1) 将栅格化的输入提升为3D表示，并在目标相机姿势下渲染；2) 扩展SAM2的时间记忆机制到空间域，建立部件级别的对应关系；3) 在栅格到矢量转换过程中，进行路径合并和结构优化。

Result: 生成的SVG在视图间具有很强的几何和颜色一致性，显著减少了冗余路径，并保留了精细的结构细节。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了生成模型和结构化矢量表示，为单输入、对象级别的多视图SVG生成提供了一条可扩展的途径，并支持资产创建和语义矢量编辑等应用。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Mesh RAG 的新型、免训练、即插即用的自回归网格生成模型框架，该框架通过利用点云分割、空间变换和点云配准来检索、生成和集成网格组件，从而增强生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了自动化和加速网格资产的创建，自回归模型已经成为一种强大的艺术网格生成范例。然而，当前提高质量的方法通常依赖于更大的模型或更长的序列，这导致更长的生成时间，并且其固有的顺序性质带来了严重的质量-速度权衡。这种顺序依赖性也显着地使增量编辑复杂化。

Method: 受到语言模型 RAG 的启发，我们的方法通过利用点云分割、空间变换和点云配准来检索、生成和集成网格组件，从而增强生成过程。这种基于检索的方法将生成从其严格的顺序依赖性中解耦出来，从而促进高效且可并行化的推理。

Result: 我们证明了 Mesh RAG 在各种基础自回归网格生成模型中的广泛适用性，表明与顺序部分预测相比，它可以显着提高网格质量，加快生成速度，并实现增量编辑，所有这些都无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: Mesh RAG 是一种很有前途的自回归网格生成模型框架，它可以提高网格质量，加快生成速度，并实现增量编辑。

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

Result: 在 NTU RGB+D 60 和 NTU RGB+D 120 数据集上，该模型在不同的遮挡设置下，准确率提高了 12.9%。

Conclusion: Parts-Mamba 模型能够有效提高在骨骼不完整情况下的动作识别准确率。

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

Method: 提出了NFGlassNet，一种新的玻璃表面检测方法，它利用闪光/非闪光图像中存在的反射动态。具体来说，我们提出了一个反射对比挖掘模块（RCMM）来提取反射，以及一个反射引导注意力模块（RGAM）来融合来自反射和玻璃表面的特征，以实现精确的玻璃表面检测。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，我们的方法优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在玻璃表面检测方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

Conclusion: 提出的 Warm Diffusion 模型能够有效地结合模糊和噪声，提高图像生成效果。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

Conclusion: 该数据集和代码将在发布时公开。

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 在单一视觉空间中统一模型、任务和表示是通用多模态智能的一个有希望的范例。

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的异常生成方法通常需要在少量异常样本上进行微调，这与异常样本稀缺的假设相矛盾，并且容易过拟合类别先验。

Conclusion: DeltaDeno 是一种有效的零样本异常生成方法，可以在没有真实异常样本或训练的情况下生成逼真的局部缺陷，并且可以提高下游检测性能。

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: DGAF-VSR在视频超分辨率任务上表现出色，并在感知质量、保真度和时间一致性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

Abstract: Background:Accurate tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is crucial for digital dentistry but remains challenging in cases of interdental adhesions, which cause severe anatomical shape distortion.
  Methods:
  To address this, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates semantic and shape awareness for shape-preserving segmentation. Our method introduces a target-tooth-centroid prompted multi-label learning strategy to model semantic relationships between teeth, reducing shape ambiguity. Additionally, a tooth-shape-aware learning mechanism explicitly enforces morphological constraints to preserve boundary integrity. These components are unified via multi-task learning, jointly optimizing segmentation and shape preservation.
  Results: Extensive evaluations on internal and external datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
  Conclusions: Our approach effectively mitigates shape distortions and providing anatomically faithful tooth boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的时空视频定位（STVG）基准OmniGround，旨在解决现有模型在处理复杂现实世界场景时的局限性。同时，提出了一个名为PG-TAF的无训练框架，该框架在OmniGround及其他基准测试中均表现出显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STVG模型在处理多样化对象和复杂查询时存在差距，这归因于有限的基准范围，导致模型表现出类别偏差、过度简化的推理和较差的语言鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 构建了一个包含3,475个视频，涵盖81个类别的综合基准OmniGround。2. 提出了Forward-Backward-Refinement标注流程，结合多向跟踪和智能纠错，以获得高质量的标签。3. 引入了DeepSTG，一个系统评估框架，用于量化数据集质量。4. 提出了PG-TAF，一个无训练的两阶段框架，将STVG分解为高层次的时间定位和细粒度的时空传播。

Result: 在复杂现实世界场景中，模型性能平均下降10.4%，特别是在处理小/遮挡对象和复杂的空间关系时。PG-TAF在OmniGround上实现了25.6%的m_tIoU和35.6%的m_vIoU改进，并在四个基准测试中都获得了持续的收益。

Conclusion: 本文提出的OmniGround基准和PG-TAF框架有效地提升了模型在复杂现实场景下的时空视频定位性能。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiPriv，首个旨在系统评估视觉语言模型中个体层面隐私推理的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的隐私基准在结构上不足以应对新的威胁，因为它们主要评估隐私感知，而未能解决隐私推理这一更关键的风险，即视觉语言模型推断和链接分布式信息以构建个体档案的能力。

Method: 引入了隐私感知与推理（PPR）框架，并构建了一个新的双语多模态数据集来支持它。该数据集独特地具有合成个体档案的核心组件，其中标识符（例如，面孔、姓名）与敏感属性相关联。这种设计实现了九项具有挑战性的任务，评估从属性检测到跨图像重新识别和链式推理的完整PPR谱。

Result: 对50多个基础和商业视觉语言模型的大规模评估表明：(1) 许多视觉语言模型具有显著的、未测量的基于推理的隐私风险。(2) 感知层面的指标不能很好地预测这些推理风险，揭示了一个关键的评估差距。(3) 现有的安全对齐对于这种基于推理的攻击是不一致和无效的。

Conclusion: MultiPriv 暴露了系统性漏洞，并为开发强大的、保护隐私的视觉语言模型提供了必要的框架。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的隐式神经表示 (INR) 框架，该框架可以联合建模动态图像序列及其底层运动场，从而实现时间相干图像和运动场的同步恢复，而无需先验流估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态磁共振成像 (dMRI) 捕获时间分辨的解剖结构，但通常受到有限采样和运动引起的伪影的挑战。传统的运动补偿重建通常依赖于预先估计的光流，这在欠采样下是不准确的，并且会降低重建质量。

Method: 采用一个 INR 来参数化时空图像内容，而另一个 INR 表示光流。两者通过光流方程耦合，除了强制与 k 空间测量一致的数据一致性损失外，光流方程还充当物理启发的正则化。

Result: 在动态心脏 MRI 数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法优于最先进的运动补偿和深度学习方法，实现了卓越的重建质量、准确的运动估计和改进的时间保真度。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了具有流正则化约束的隐式联合建模在推进 dMRI 重建方面的潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 理解细粒度的人手运动对于视觉感知、具身智能和多模态通信至关重要。

Method: 本文提出了 FiGOP，它将每个 RGB 关键帧与后续手部关键点配对，直到下一个关键帧。一个轻量级的时间编码器将关键点转换为运动嵌入，并将其与 RGB 特征集成。

Result: 在 FingerCap-40K 上的实验表明，强大的开源和闭源 Video-MLLM 仍然难以进行手指级别的推理，而我们的 FiGOP 增强模型在 HandJudge 和人类研究下产生了持续的收益。

Conclusion: FiGOP 能够恢复精细的时间线索，而无需增加 RGB 密度，从而提高模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

Motivation: 现有的面部表情识别方法主要集中在完全监督学习上，并且依赖于昂贵、耗时的时序边界注释。因此，本文研究了点监督面部表情识别。

Method: 该框架包含两个分支：基于高斯的实例自适应强度建模 (GIM) 模块，用于生成软伪标签，以及一个类别感知的顶点分类分支，用于区分宏表情和微表情。此外，还引入了强度感知的对比损失来增强判别性特征学习。

Result: 在 SAMM-LV、CAS(ME)$^2$ 和 CAS(ME)$^3$ 数据集上的大量实验表明了所提出框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的点监督面部表情识别框架，并在实验中验证了其性能。

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: Neighbor GRPO: A novel alignment algorithm that bypasses the need for SDEs by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm, and current SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling.

Method: Proposes Neighbor GRPO, an alignment algorithm that perturbs the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. Introduces symmetric anchor sampling and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting.

Result: Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

Conclusion: Neighbor GRPO is a better alternative to SDE-based GRPO methods for aligning image and video generative models with human preferences.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

TL;DR: MatPedia是一个基础模型，它使用新颖的联合RGB-PBR表示来统一自然图像外观和PBR属性，从而实现高质量和多样性的材质生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏统一的表示来桥接自然图像外观和PBR属性，导致任务流程分散且无法利用大规模RGB图像数据。

Method: 该模型将材质编码为两个相互依赖的潜在变量：一个用于RGB外观，一个用于编码互补物理属性的四个PBR贴图。 通过将它们公式化为5帧序列并采用视频扩散架构，MatPedia可以自然地捕获它们的相关性，同时从RGB生成模型中转移视觉先验。

Result: MatPedia在MatHybrid-410K混合语料库上进行训练，实现了原生$1024 \times 1024$合成，在质量和多样性方面均大大超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: MatPedia通过联合RGB-PBR表示和视频扩散架构，实现了统一的框架，可以处理多种材质任务，例如文本到材质生成、图像到材质生成和固有分解。

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

Motivation: 以往的单图像超分辨率方法在已知和固定的退化情况下表现出色，但当实际退化偏离这些假设时，性能会显著下降。这篇论文旨在解决盲超分辨率问题。

Method: 该方法提出一个双分支退化提取网络，预测代表模糊和噪声信息的无监督退化嵌入，并以不同的方式调整超分辨率网络以适应模糊嵌入和噪声嵌入。同时，将退化提取器视为正则化器，以利用超分辨率图像和高分辨率图像之间的差异。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在盲超分辨率问题上取得了SOTA的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在盲超分辨率问题上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Conclusion: 该模型能够根据用户偏好的视觉目标生成食物图像，并引入了特定领域的烹饪图像相似度 (CIS) 指标，以确保时间一致性和烹饪合理性。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

Motivation: 现有方法容易陷入已知类别的结构风险和未知类别的开放空间风险之间的两难境地，并且容易过度自信，尤其是在区分与已知类别共享细粒度视觉相似性的“硬未知”时。

Result: 在五个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，相对于现有方法，准确率提高了 3%，H-score 提高了 5%。

Conclusion: SeeCLIP 框架在开放集域泛化任务上表现出显著的改进，有效地提升了模型在面对领域偏移和新类别时的性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自然选择机制实现了更有效的3DGS模型压缩，并在性能上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency. Experimental results in both multi- and single-band RME demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the proposed RadioKMoE in radiomap estimation.

*Jonathan Skaza,Parsa Madinei,Ziqi Wen,Miguel Eckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DReX is a vision-only model for predicting image complexity that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human perception of image complexity is important for computer vision tasks and cognitive science.

Method: DReX fuses multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16 using a learnable attention mechanism.

Result: DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark and generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: Visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction, and fusing self-supervised transformers with supervised deep convolutional neural networks offers synergistic benefits.

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthFocus是一种新的立体深度估计模型，它能够根据用户的深度偏好动态地调整计算，从而在复杂的场景中实现选择性的感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型是被动的，试图估计锚定到最近表面的静态深度图，而人类会主动地转移注意力来感知所需的深度。

Method: DepthFocus是一种可操纵的Vision Transformer，它将立体深度估计重新定义为意图驱动的控制。该模型以标量深度偏好为条件，动态地调整其计算以关注预期深度。

Result: DepthFocus在传统的单深度基准测试（如BOOSTER）上取得了最先进的性能，BOOSTER是一个透明和反射对象非常丰富的数据集，并且定量地证明了我们新提出的真实和合成多深度数据集上的意图对齐估计。

Conclusion: DepthFocus在未见过的透视场景中表现出强大的泛化能力，强调了其作为迈向主动和类人3D感知的重要一步的稳健性。

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

*Qianyi Shao,Yuanfan Zhang,Renxiang Xiao,Liang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的记忆增强视觉语言恢复（MVLR）模型，用于恢复各种天气条件下不同退化程度的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣天气条件下（如下雨、雾霾、下雪或它们的混合）实现可靠的视觉感知，对于自动驾驶和户外机器人而言是理想的，但具有挑战性。

Method: MVLR模型将轻量级编码器-解码器主干网络与视觉语言模型（VLM）和隐式记忆库（IMB）相结合。VLM执行思维链推理以编码天气退化先验，IMB存储退化模式的连续潜在表示。VLM生成的先验查询IMB以检索细粒度的退化原型。然后，这些原型通过动态交叉注意力机制与多尺度视觉特征自适应融合，从而提高恢复精度，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在四个恶劣天气基准上的大量实验表明，MVLR在峰值信噪比（PSNR）和结构相似性指标（SSIM）方面均超过了单分支和混合专家基线。

Conclusion: MVLR在模型紧凑性和表达性之间提供了实际的平衡，适合在各种户外条件下进行实时部署。

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉-语言模型在处理混合文化概念时表现不佳，即使是最先进的模型也会受到影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉-语言模型在不同文化输入下的稳定性，因为现有评估忽略了多种文化线索共存的情况。

Method: 引入ConfusedTourist，一个新的文化对抗鲁棒性测试套件，旨在评估视觉-语言模型对地理线索扰动的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，在简单的图像叠加扰动下，准确率会大幅下降，甚至在基于图像生成的变体中会变得更糟。可解释性分析表明，这些失败源于对分散注意力的线索的系统性关注转移，从而转移了模型对其预期焦点的注意力。

Conclusion: 视觉文化概念的混合会严重损害即使是最先进的视觉-语言模型，因此迫切需要更具文化鲁棒性的多模态理解。

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受化学中取代机制的启发，将身份编辑重新解释为预训练无条件扩散模型潜在h空间中的语义位移。

Method: 通过新颖的试剂损失引导的优化来发现身份编辑方向，从而监督属性保持和身份抑制。提出了线性和测地线（基于切线）编辑方案，以有效地导航潜在流形。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和FFHQ上的实验结果表明，FLUID在身份抑制和属性保持之间实现了卓越的权衡，在定性和定量指标上均优于最先进的去识别方法。

Conclusion: FLUID框架在身份抑制和属性保持方面表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的合成方法，可以直接从RGB图像估计CoC图，无需场景深度或相机元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将3D虚拟对象无缝混合到拍摄的真实场景中，一致且自然的相机镜头模糊非常重要。由于镜头模糊通常随场景深度而变化，因此虚拟对象的放置及其相应的模糊程度会显着影响混合现实构图的视觉保真度。现有的流程通常依赖于相机参数和场景深度来计算模糊圈（CoC）以进行逼真的镜头模糊渲染。但是，普通用户通常无法获得此类信息，从而限制了这些方法的可访问性和通用性。

Method: 通过其有符号CoC图和深度之间的线性关系推断虚拟对象的CoC值，并使用神经重模糊网络渲染逼真的镜头模糊。

Result: 我们的方法为实际应用提供了灵活实用的解决方案。实验结果表明，我们的方法通过逼真的散焦效果实现了高保真合成，在定性和定量评估中均优于最新的技术。

Conclusion: 我们的方法实现了具有真实散焦效果的高保真合成，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance computer vision in sports analytics by providing fine-grained racket pose annotations in addition to ball positions, enabling research into human-object interactions.

Method: The dataset is designed for three tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Uses CrossAttention mechanism for multi-modal fusion.

Result: Naive concatenation of racket pose features degrades performance, but CrossAttention unlocks their value, surpassing strong unimodal baselines in trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: RacketVision is a versatile resource for research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动布局设计或全景图像引导的问题，为合理的空间布置生成显式布局标准。

Method: 引入了语言驱动的 agent 规划器的分层结构，将简短且模棱两可的提示自动解析为详细的场景描述，然后使用这些描述来初始化 3D 点云。为了在有界环境中定位对象，我们实施了两个排列约束，迭代优化空间排列，确保无碰撞且可访问的布局解决方案。在最终渲染阶段，提出了一种新的 AnyReach 采样策略用于相机轨迹，以及间隔时间步长流采样 (ITFS) 策略，以有效优化粗略的 3D 高斯场景表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可以生成几何上合理的 3D 室内场景，在渲染速度和视觉质量上都超过了以前的方法，同时保留了可编辑性，总生成时间缩短到 30 分钟 以下。

Conclusion: RoomPlanner 是一个有效的框架，用于从文本生成高质量、可编辑的 3D 室内场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

TL;DR: PathAgent是一个基于大型语言模型的框架，它模仿病理学家的逐步分析方法，以提高WSI分析的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算流程缺乏明确的推理轨迹，导致预测不透明且难以解释。

Method: PathAgent使用Navigator模块定位重要区域，Perceptor提取形态视觉线索，Executor整合发现到自然语言轨迹中。

Result: PathAgent在五个具有挑战性的数据集上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，超越了特定任务的基线。

Conclusion: PathAgent具有作为透明和临床实用的诊断助手的潜力。

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的统一行人跟踪框架OmniPT，它可以交互式地跟踪、基于参考进行跟踪并生成对跟踪对象的语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在视觉定位和目标检测等实例级任务中表现不佳；行人跟踪结合了对象跟踪和自然语言，强调模型应在高级语义级别理解被跟踪对象，而这正是LVLMs的优势所在。

Method: 实现了一个包含RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL的训练阶段。首先执行一个简单的RL阶段，使模型能够输出固定且可监督的边界框格式。然后，使用大量与行人相关的数据集进行中间训练阶段。最后，在几个行人跟踪数据集上执行有监督的微调，然后进行另一个RL阶段，以提高模型的跟踪性能并增强其遵循指令的能力。

Result: 在跟踪基准上进行实验，结果表明该方法比以前的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: OmniPT框架在行人跟踪任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云补全模型通常会产生全局上合理的形状，但局部几何上存在不一致。

Method: 利用RL智能体选择性地调整completion的全局特征向量（GFV），并使用非参数PointNN选择器评估几何一致性，保留更好的重建结果。使用Chamfer Distance和几何一致性指标指导细化。

Result: 在ShapeNetCore-2048上的实验表明，RL-AD-Net在不同裁剪场景下都能稳定地提高补全效果。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量级、模块化且模型无关，适用于各种补全网络，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states.

Method: model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion.

Result: demonstrates our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: REArtGS++ is better than existing approaches in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation.

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于身体或临床限制，某些患者无法进行 MRI 检查。以往尝试从 CT 扫描合成 MRI 的研究在低剂量方案下效果不佳，因为 CT 图像稀疏且平面分辨率低。

Method: 1. 使用布朗桥扩散模型 (BBDM) 沿 2D 维度合成 MRI 切片。2. 通过微调的检索模型从先前的数据库中检索结构和病理相似的 CT 切片作为参考，并通过 ControlNet 分支引导生成中间 MRI 切片，确保结构连续性。3. 使用球面线性插值来补充指导，以解决数据库缺乏合适参考时罕见的检索失败问题。

Result: 在 SynthRAD2023 和 BraTS 上的大量实验表明，ReBrain 在稀疏条件下的跨模态重建方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReBrain 是一种有效的脑部 MRI 重建方法，尤其适用于稀疏 CT 扫描。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR 是一种简单而有效的方法，可以恢复 VAR 模型的生成多样性，而无需任何额外的训练。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wangtong627/DiverseVAR.

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ReCoVAD通过模仿人类神经系统的双重反射和意识通路，实现选择性帧处理，以减少冗余计算，从而在视频异常检测中实现高效的训练自由性能。

Motivation: 现有研究通常依赖于密集的帧级别推理，导致高计算成本和延迟。为了解决这个问题，论文探讨了在使用强大的预训练模型时，密集推理是否真的必要。

Method: ReCoVAD包含两个核心通路：(i) 反射通路，使用轻量级CLIP模块融合视觉特征与原型提示，生成决策向量，查询动态记忆中的过去帧和异常分数以快速响应；(ii) 意识通路，使用中等规模的视觉-语言模型生成文本事件描述和改进的异常分数。集成的大型语言模型定期审查累积的描述，以识别未见过的异常，纠正错误并改进原型。

Conclusion: 稀疏推理足以实现有效的基于大型模型的视频异常检测。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

Conclusion: 通过增加轨迹候选的数量，可以持续提升整体性能。

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，从预训练的文本模型中学习知识可以有效地提高视觉情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

TL;DR: ChainV通过动态整合视觉提示来优化多模态推理，减少冗余的自我反思，提高推理准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推理模型在生成长推理链时存在冗余的自我反思，并且现有的CoT压缩方法依赖于静态视觉参考，效果有限。

Method: ChainV框架首先基于先前的推理步骤进行粗略的视觉补丁选择，然后通过识别最具代表性的原子视觉提示来细化它，并引入基于一致性的评估机制来评估所选提示的可靠性，从而自适应地调整自我反思的程度。最终，所选视觉提示的像素坐标及其可靠性通过伯努利随机过程被纳入推理。

Result: ChainV在数学密集型基准测试中显著提高了推理准确性和效率。例如，在MIMO-VL-RL中，ChainV在MathVista上实现了2.3%的改进，同时将推理延迟降低了51.4%，并将输出token长度缩短了24.5%。

Conclusion: ChainV框架通过动态整合视觉提示，有效地减少了多模态推理中的冗余，提高了推理性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

Conclusion: PEGS方法在重建大时空尺度上的刚性运动方面优于主流动态方法。

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

Motivation: 传统的相机内色彩映射依赖于基于相关色温（CCT）的插值，这种方法在现代LED照明技术中存在局限性，因为LED光源可能偏离普朗克轨迹。

Method: 使用基于2D色度空间的多层感知器（MLP）替代传统的CCT插值，并通过包含代表性LED光源的lightbox校准程序进行训练。

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应多光源场景，并支持实时相机部署，且计算成本可以忽略不计。

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于深度学习的图像压缩 (LIC) 已经实现了最先进的率失真 (RD) 性能，但在资源受限的 FPGA 上部署这些模型仍然是一个主要挑战。

Method: 首先，我们提出了一种动态范围感知量化 (DRAQ) 方法，该方法使用统计校准的激活剪裁和一种新的权重正则化方案来抵消极端数据异常值和大数据范围的影响，成功创建了一个高保真 8 位整数模型。其次，在此基础上，我们引入了两种专为 FPGA 定制的硬件感知优化技术。一种渐进式混合精度搜索算法利用 FPGA 的灵活性为每一层分配最佳的非均匀位宽，从而最大限度地降低复杂性，同时保持性能。同时，一种适用于 LIC 中常见的广义除法归一化 (GDN) 层的通道剪枝方法通过消除非活动通道来消除模型冗余。

Result: 我们的综合实验表明，基础 DRAQ 方法将基于 GDN 的模型的 BD-rate 开销从 $30\%$ 降低到 $6.3\%$。随后的硬件感知优化进一步降低了超过 $20\%$ 的计算复杂度，而对 RD 性能的影响可忽略不计，从而产生了在效率方面处于领先地位并且在质量上优于现有基于 FPGA 的 LIC 实现的最终模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种完整的、多阶段的优化框架，以弥合高性能浮点模型和高效、硬件友好的基于整数的实现之间的差距。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

TL;DR: ODTSR: A one-step diffusion transformer using a Noise-hybrid Visual Stream and Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training for Real-ISR, balancing fidelity and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step diffusion methods in Real-ISR lack fidelity due to randomness, while one-step methods lack controllability due to specific finetuning.

Method: Introduces ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer with Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design and Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA). NVS uses adjustable noise (Control Noise) and consistent noise (Prior Noise).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on generic Real-ISR and enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios like real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without specific training.

Conclusion: ODTSR effectively balances fidelity and controllability in Real-ISR through its novel architecture and training approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的损失函数（如 Dice）在医学图像分割中对小病灶分割效果不佳，因为小病灶对整体损失的贡献很小。

Method: 提出了基于 CC-Metrics 框架的 CC-DiceCE 损失函数，并与现有的 blob loss 在 nnU-Net 框架下进行比较。

Result: CC-DiceCE 损失函数提高了检测率（召回率），且分割性能没有明显下降，但可能会产生更多的假阳性。在多数据集研究中，CC-DiceCE 的表现通常优于 blob loss。

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE 损失函数在提高医学图像中小病灶的分割检测率方面具有优势，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无配对图像转换（UIT）方法在领域自适应过程中经常忽略类别特定的语义对齐，导致内容-类别映射错位，从而损害诊断准确性。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了UI-Styler。

Method: UI-Styler利用模式匹配机制将嵌入在目标图像中的纹理模式转移到源图像上，同时保留源结构内容。此外，我们引入了一种由目标域的伪标签引导的类别感知提示策略，该策略强制执行与诊断类别的精确语义对齐。

Result: 在超声跨设备任务上的大量实验表明，UI-Styler始终优于现有的UIT方法，在分布距离和下游任务（如分类和分割）中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UI-Styler是一种有效的超声图像风格迁移框架，可以提高跨设备超声图像分析的准确性。

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.

*Dragos-Alexandru Boldisor,Stefan Smeu,Dan Oneata,Elisabeta Oneata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督表示在音频-视频deepfake检测中的潜力，发现它们能捕捉到deepfake相关信息，但泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作通常孤立地使用这些特征或将它们埋藏在复杂的架构中，而本文旨在系统地评估它们在不同模态和领域中的表现。

Method: 本文在不同模态（音频、视频、多模态）和领域（嘴唇动作、通用视觉内容）中系统地评估自监督特征，并评估三个关键维度：检测效果、编码信息的可解释性和跨模态互补性。

Result: 大多数自监督特征捕获了deepfake相关信息，并且这些信息是互补的。模型主要关注语义上有意义的区域，而不是虚假的伪影。但是，没有一个模型能够在数据集之间可靠地推广。

Conclusion: 自监督表示在deepfake检测中具有潜力，但实现鲁棒的跨域性能仍然很困难。

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

### [114] [Equivariant-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Edge Deployment: A Comprehensive Framework with Adaptive Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17242)
*Mohammed Alnemari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，将群等变卷积神经网络（G-CNNs）与等变感知结构化剪枝相结合，以生成用于资源受限环境的紧凑型、变换不变模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的环境中，需要既能保持几何变换下的一致性能，又能降低计算开销的模型。

Method: 该方法通过分析e2cnn层结构并对全连接组件应用神经元级剪枝，实现了保持等变属性的结构化剪枝。为了减轻精度下降，我们实施了自适应微调，当精度下降超过2%时自动触发，使用提前停止和学习率调度以实现有效恢复。该框架包括动态INT8量化和包含训练、知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、微调和量化的综合流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，参数减少了29.3%，同时精度得到了显着恢复，表明等变网络的结构化剪枝实现了显着的压缩，同时保持了几何鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的 pipeline 提供了一个可重现的框架，用于优化等变模型，弥合了群论网络设计和实际部署约束之间的差距，与卫星图像分析和几何视觉任务特别相关。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在低光照下鲁棒性不足，并且未能有效利用互补的多模态线索。

Method: 本文提出了 LENS-Net，它集成了自适应图像增强检测器，用于联合光照校正和标志定位，然后是结构化的多模态 CLIP-GCNN 分类器，该分类器利用跨模态注意力和基于图的推理来实现鲁棒且语义一致的识别。

Result: LENS-Net 超过了现有的框架，消融研究证实了其关键组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文发布了 INTSD 数据集和 LENS-Net 的代码，以供研究使用。

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在各种任务中表现出色，但仍然容易产生幻觉。

Method: 该研究提出了一个综合干预框架，该框架与LVLMs中transformer的因果结构对齐，整合了图像到输入文本、图像到输出文本和文本到文本路径的不同干预路径对幻觉的影响。

Result: LVLMs中的幻觉并非来自单一因果路径，而是来自图像到输入文本、图像到输出文本和文本到文本路径之间的相互作用。LVLMs依赖于不同的路径，具体取决于问答对齐格式。该方法可以识别和干预每条路径中的关键幻觉头，并针对判别式和生成式格式进行定制。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法能够持续减少各种对齐类型中的幻觉。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

TL;DR: MuM模型通过扩展MAE到多视角，优于DINOv3和CroCo v2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习主要关注语义理解，而几何推理较少。CroCo是为3D理解定制的MAE，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 将MAE扩展到同一场景的任意多个视角，采用轻量级解码器和帧间注意力机制。

Result: MuM模型在下游任务（包括前馈重建、密集图像匹配和相对姿态估计）上优于DINOv3和CroCo v2。

Conclusion: MuM模型更简单、可扩展，且在3D视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

TL;DR: PostCam: A framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies, limiting camera control precision and failing to preserve fine visual details.

Method: Introduces a query-shared cross-attention module that integrates 6-DoF camera poses and 2D rendered video frames into a unified representation and adopts a two-stage training strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Conclusion: PostCam enhances both control precision and generation quality in novel-view video generation.

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过编辑真实世界的LiDAR扫描，使用基于语义掩码的指导来生成新的合成LiDAR点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取来自真实世界点云数据的各种场景具有挑战性，尤其对于关键边缘情况，这限制了系统泛化和鲁棒性。当前方法依赖于在手工制作的3D虚拟环境中模拟点云数据，这是耗时、计算昂贵，并且通常无法完全捕获真实世界场景的复杂性。

Method: 利用range image projection和semantic mask conditioning实现基于扩散的生成。点云被转换为2D range view图像，这被用作中间表示，以实现使用基于凸包的语义掩码进行语义编辑。这些掩码通过提供有关真实环境中对象的尺寸、方向和位置的信息来指导生成过程，确保几何一致性和真实感。

Result: 展示了高质量的LiDAR点云生成，能够生成复杂的边缘情况和动态场景，已在KITTI-360数据集上得到验证。

Conclusion: 提供了一种经济高效且可扩展的解决方案，用于生成各种LiDAR数据，这是提高自动驾驶系统鲁棒性的一步。

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率鲁棒性（PR）指标，称为非参数概率鲁棒性（NPPR），它不依赖于任何预定义的扰动分布，而是直接从数据中学习优化的扰动分布，从而在分布不确定性下实现保守的PR评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率鲁棒性（PR）公式假设一个固定且已知的扰动分布，这在实践中是不现实的。

Method: 开发了一种基于高斯混合模型（GMM）的NPPR估计器，该模型具有多层感知器（MLP）头和双三次向上采样，涵盖各种输入相关和输入无关的扰动场景。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上进行了大量实验，验证了NPPR作为一种更实用的鲁棒性指标，与假设最先进技术中使用的常见扰动分布相比，NPPR的PR估计值保守（较低）高达40%。

Conclusion: NPPR 是一种更实用的鲁棒性指标，它不依赖于预定义的扰动分布，并且能够提供更保守的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段噪声解耦框架，用于处理高光谱图像(HSI)去噪问题，有效处理复杂真实噪声并显著提高HSI质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有噪声建模方法难以准确模拟真实HSI中的复杂噪声，限制了去噪网络的效果。

Method: 将复杂噪声分解为显式建模和隐式建模两部分，分别使用现有噪声模型和高频小波引导网络处理，并通过多阶段学习策略优化整个框架。

Result: 在公共和自捕获数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架优于现有技术水平的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理复杂真实噪声，显著提高HSI质量。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Motivation: 多语言文本到图像模型在视觉真实性和语义对齐方面取得了显著进展，但由于语言带有文化内涵，多语言提示生成的图像应保持跨语言文化一致性。现有模型在处理多语言提示时，文化一致性不足。

Method: 1. 综合分析：评估现有T2I模型在多语言提示下的文化倾向。 2. 探测方法：定位文化敏感信号到特定神经元。 3. 两种对齐策略：  - 推理时文化激活：增强已识别的神经元。  - 层级目标文化增强：仅更新文化相关的层。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了多语言文本到图像模型在文化一致性方面的不足，并提出了有效的改进策略，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉创造力，这是一个大型语言模型尚未充分探索的领域。研究比较了人类参与者（视觉艺术家和非艺术家）和图像生成AI模型在图像生成方面的创造力。

Method: 比较人类参与者（视觉艺术家和非艺术家）和图像生成AI模型生成的图像，使用人类评分员和GPT4o评估图像的创造力。

Result: 视觉艺术家最具创造力，其次是非艺术家，然后是人工指导的生成AI，最后是自主引导的生成AI。更多的人工指导可以显著提高GenAI的创造力输出。

Conclusion: 与以语言为中心的任务相比，GenAI模型在视觉领域可能面临独特的挑战，因为创造力取决于感知上的细微差别和情境敏感性，这些都是人类独特的能力，可能无法轻易地从语言模型中转移。

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent multi-step reasoning process inside the model.

Method: Using a BASIC-style prompting language with numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior.

Result: LLMs can execute Cognitive BASIC programs with strong but not uniform performance.

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC enables transparent multi-step reasoning inside LLMs.

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

Motivation: 当前用户界面不能很好地解释贝叶斯网络的推理过程，用户难以理解贝叶斯网络。

Method: 设计了标准贝叶斯网络用户界面的口头和视觉扩展，以引导用户理解常见的推理模式。通过用户研究比较了口头、视觉和组合用户界面扩展以及基线用户界面。

Result: 所有三种类型的扩展在回答关于观察的影响、实现这种影响的路径以及观察如何影响其他观察的影响的问题时，都比基线用户界面表现更好；对于某些问题类型，同时使用口头和视觉方式比单独使用任何一种方式更好。

Conclusion: 口头和视觉扩展可以有效帮助用户理解贝叶斯网络推理，并且结合使用效果更佳。

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

Conclusion: MirrorMind通过整合个体认知深度与集体学科广度，实现了结构化、个性化和产生洞察力的科学推理，从而弥合了当前人工智能科学家在表示结构化、高保真认知和社会环境方面的差距。

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: 增加工具调用预算不一定能提高大型语言模型代理的性能，因为它们缺乏预算意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何有效地扩展具有显式工具调用预算的代理，重点是Web搜索代理。

Method: 提出了预算跟踪器（Budget Tracker）和预算感知测试时缩放框架（BATS），以提高代理的预算意识，并动态调整其规划和验证策略。

Result: 预算感知方法产生更有利的缩放曲线，并推动成本-性能帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 为更透明和有原则地理解工具增强代理的扩展提供了经验性见解。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 重构主要由测量一致性驱动，先验引导有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从贝叶斯的角度来看，基于分数的扩散通过联合推理解决逆问题，将可能性与先验嵌入以指导采样过程。然而，这种公式无法解释它的实际行为：先验提供的指导有限，而重构很大程度上是由测量一致性项驱动的，导致推理过程与扩散动力学有效解耦。

Method: 将逆问题求解中扩散的作用重新解释为期望最大化 (EM) 风格框架中的初始化阶段，其中扩散阶段和数据驱动的细化完全解耦。引入 \textbf{DAPS++}，它允许似然项更直接地指导推理，同时保持数值稳定性，并深入了解为什么统一扩散轨迹在实践中仍然有效。

Result: \textbf{DAPS++} 通过减少函数评估 (NFE) 和测量优化步骤，在各种图像恢复任务中实现了高计算效率和稳健的重建性能。

Conclusion: 扩散在逆问题求解中可以被视为一个初始化阶段，并且提出了DAPS++来实现高计算效率和稳健的重建性能。

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Motivation: 为了在高风险应用中利用这种系统的潜力，我们需要大型的结构化表格数据集，我们可以在其上构建透明的基于特征的模型。

Method: 我们建议使用虚拟证据并辅以一致性节点，以提供模型预测的可解释的概率融合。

Result: 与单独的虚拟证据相比，一致性节点提高了最终预测的校准，从而使贝叶斯网络可以更好地调整神经分类器的输出，以处理缺失的信息并解决表格数据和文本数据之间的矛盾。

Conclusion: 我们在SimSUM数据集上展示了我们方法的潜力，SimSUM数据集是一个通过专家知识将表格EHR与临床笔记链接起来的模拟基准。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

Method: 论文构建了一个模块化的本体设计模式(ODP)，通过信念、欲望、意图及其动态关系来捕获agent的认知架构。该本体与基础本体和模块化设计的最佳实践对齐，确保了语义的精确性和可重用性。通过Logic Augmented Generation (LAG)将本体与大型语言模型(LLM)耦合，并将其集成到Semas推理平台中，实现了RDF三元组和agent心理状态之间的双向流动。

Result: 实验表明，BDI本体可以作为声明式智能和程序式智能之间的概念和操作桥梁。

Conclusion: 该研究为在Web of Data中运行的认知 grounded、可解释和语义互操作的多agent和神经符号系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中，当探索空间扩大时，导致奖励的联合行动轨迹呈指数稀疏性，并且现有方法通常未能考虑能够影响团队状态的联合行动。

Method: 提出了互利内在奖励（MIR）策略，激励个体智能体探索影响队友的动作，并将其与原始策略结合，以刺激团队探索。

Result: 在MiniGrid-MA环境中的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MIR是一种简单有效的MARL增强策略，可以有效解决奖励稀疏性问题，并提高算法性能。

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

Method: 该框架将多智能体系统构建成一个逻辑层次结构，该结构反映了给定领域内在的任务依赖关系图。该框架的一个实例是EarthAgent，一个为复杂地理空间分析量身定制的多智能体系统。

Result: EarthAgent 在一系列已建立的单智能体和多智能体系统中表现显著优异。GeoPlan-bench是一个综合性的基准，用于评估实际的、多步骤的地理空间规划任务。它附带一套精心设计的指标，用于评估工具选择、路径相似性和逻辑完整性。

Conclusion: 将智能体架构与领域内在的任务结构对齐，是构建稳健可靠的专业自主系统的关键一步。

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

Motivation: 自然行为样本稀缺，研究人员依赖合成或非策略LLM响应来训练探针，但这些数据对探针泛化性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估了合成和非策略数据对八种不同LLM行为探针泛化的影响，测试了线性探针和注意力探针在多个LLM上的表现。

Result: 响应生成策略会显著影响探针性能，从非策略数据到模型被激励产生目标行为的测试集的成功泛化，可以预测成功的策略内泛化。不同领域训练数据导致更大的性能下降。

Conclusion: 在缺乏策略内数据的情况下，使用相同领域的非策略数据比使用不同领域的策略内数据产生更可靠的探针，强调需要更好地处理LLM监控中的分布变化的方法。

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的协同感知方法需要传输大量与驾驶安全无关的感知数据，超过了可用的通信带宽，并且大多数CP框架依赖于预定义的通信伙伴，这使得它们不适合动态交通环境。

Method: 提出了一种自发的风险感知选择性协同感知（SRA-CP）框架。SRA-CP引入了一种分散协议，其中连接的代理连续广播轻量级感知覆盖摘要，并且仅在检测到与风险相关的盲区时才启动有针对性的合作。感知风险识别模块使每个CV能够在本地评估遮挡对其驾驶任务的影响，并确定是否需要合作。当CP被触发时，自我车辆基于共享的感知覆盖范围选择合适的对等方，并通过融合模块进行选择性信息交换，该融合模块优先考虑安全关键内容并适应带宽约束。

Result: SRA-CP对于安全关键对象的平均精度（AP）损失小于通用CP的1％，而仅使用20％的通信带宽。此外，与不包含风险意识的现有选择性CP方法相比，它将感知性能提高了15％。

Conclusion: SRA-CP框架能够在减少通信带宽使用的同时，提高感知性能。

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.

Abstract: Enterprise ERP systems managing hundreds of thousands of employee records face critical data quality challenges when human resources departments perform decentralized manual entry across multiple languages. We present an end-to-end pipeline combining automated data cleaning with LLM-driven SQL query generation, deployed on a production system managing 240,000 employee records over six months.
  The system operates in two integrated stages: a multi-stage cleaning pipeline that performs translation normalization, spelling correction, and entity deduplication during periodic synchronization from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL; and a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by GPT-4o that translates natural-language questions in Turkish, Russian, and English into validated SQL queries. The query engine employs LangChain orchestration, FAISS vector similarity search, and few-shot learning with 500+ validated examples.
  Our evaluation demonstrates 92.5% query validity, 95.1% schema compliance, and 90.7\% semantic accuracy on 2,847 production queries. The system reduces query turnaround time from 2.3 days to under 5 seconds while maintaining 99.2% uptime, with GPT-4o achieving 46% lower latency and 68% cost reduction versus GPT-3.5. This modular architecture provides a reproducible framework for AI-native enterprise data governance, demonstrating real-world viability at enterprise scale with 4.3/5.0 user satisfaction.

TL;DR: LinkML is an open framework that simplifies the process of authoring, validating, and sharing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of structure in scientific data challenges interoperability, making data integration, validation, and reuse difficult.

Method: LinkML provides a standard way to describe schemas, classes, and relationships, allowing modelers to build well-defined, stable, and optionally ontology-aligned data structures.

Result: LinkML helps reduce heterogeneity, complexity, and the proliferation of single-use data models while simultaneously enabling compliance with FAIR data standards. LinkML has seen increasing adoption in various fields.

Conclusion: LinkML makes implicit models explicitly computable and allows data to be standardized at its origin.

Abstract: Scientific research relies on well-structured, standardized data; however, much of it is stored in formats such as free-text lab notebooks, non-standardized spreadsheets, or data repositories. This lack of structure challenges interoperability, making data integration, validation, and reuse difficult. LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language) is an open framework that simplifies the process of authoring, validating, and sharing data. LinkML can describe a range of data structures, from flat, list-based models to complex, interrelated, and normalized models that utilize polymorphism and compound inheritance. It offers an approachable syntax that is not tied to any one technical architecture and can be integrated seamlessly with many existing frameworks. The LinkML syntax provides a standard way to describe schemas, classes, and relationships, allowing modelers to build well-defined, stable, and optionally ontology-aligned data structures.

### [141] [Anomaly Pattern-guided Transaction Bug Testing in Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17377)
*Huicong Xu,Shuang Liu,Xianyu Zhu,Qiyu Zhuang,Wei Lu,Xiaoyong Du*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法来测试关系数据库管理系统(RDBMSs)中的事务处理bug，特别是在不同的隔离级别下。该方法通过异常模式引导的测试用例生成和两阶段错误检测过程来解决测试事务行为的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事务隔离级别测试方法难以自动生成有效的测试用例，并且难以检测事务结果中的逻辑异常。现有方法无法有效地暴露事务处理逻辑中的bug，因为这些bug通常在特定的事务约束下触发。此外，由于随机生成的事务的正确执行结果通常是未知的，因此检测事务结果中的逻辑异常是困难的。

Method: 该研究提出了一种异常模式引导的测试方法，用于发现RDBMS中的事务bug。该方法包括一个由预定义的异常模式引导的测试用例生成技术，以及一个包含显式错误检测和隐式错误检测的两阶段检测过程。

Result: 该方法实现为一个名为APTrans的工具，并在MySQL、MariaDB和OceanBase三个广泛使用的RDBMS上进行了评估。APTrans成功识别了13个以前未知的与事务相关的bug，其中11个已得到相应开发团队的确认。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的事务bug检测方法，可以在主流RDBMS中发现新的bug。

Abstract: Concurrent transaction processing is a fundamental capability of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs), widely utilized in applications requiring high levels of parallel user interaction, such as banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and telecommunications infrastructure. Isolation levels offer a configurable mechanism to manage the interaction between concurrent transactions, enabling varying degrees of consistency and performance trade-offs. These isolation guarantees are supported by all major RDBMSs. However, testing transaction behavior under different isolation levels remains a significant challenge due to two primary reasons. First, automatically generating test transactions that can effectively expose bugs in transaction handling logic is non-trivial, as such bugs are typically triggered under specific transactional constraints. Second, detecting logic anomalies in transaction outcomes is difficult because the correct execution results are often unknown for randomly generated transactions. To address these challenges, we propose an anomaly pattern-guided testing approach for uncovering transaction bugs in RDBMSs. Our solution tackles the first challenge by introducing a test case generation technique guided by predefined anomaly patterns, which increases the likelihood of exposing transactional bugs. For the second challenge, we present a two-phase detection process, involving explicit error detection and implicit error detection, to identify bugs in transaction execution. We have implemented our approach in a tool, APTrans, and evaluated it on three widely-used RDBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, and OceanBase. APTrans successfully identified 13 previously unknown transaction-related bugs, 11 of which have been confirmed by the respective development teams.

*Liming Xiang,Jing Feng,Ziqi Yin,Zijian Li,Daihao Xue,Hongchao Qin,Ronghua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的近似最近邻搜索（ANN）方法，该方法不仅考虑了召回率，还保证了结果的误差范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANN算法只关注召回率，忽略了错误结果的偏差。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法基于图框架，提出了δ-EMG和δ-EMQG两种图结构，并结合向量量化来加速计算。

Result: 在ANN-Benchmarks数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保证召回率的同时，QPS性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在近似最近邻搜索中具有有效性，可以在大规模数据集上实现。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces is a foundational component of many modern retrieval and recommendation systems. Currently, almost all algorithms follow an $ε$-Recall-Bounded principle when comparing performance: they require the ANN search results to achieve a recall of more than $1-ε$ and then compare query-per-second (QPS) performance. However, this approach only accounts for the recall of true positive results and does not provide guarantees on the deviation of incorrect results. To address this limitation, we focus on an Error-Bounded ANN method, which ensures that the returned results are a $(1/δ)$-approximation of the true values. Our approach adopts a graph-based framework. To enable Error-Bounded ANN search, we propose a $δ$-EMG (Error-bounded Monotonic Graph), which, for the first time, provides a provable approximation for arbitrary queries. By enforcing a $δ$-monotonic geometric constraint during graph construction, $δ$-EMG ensures that any greedy search converges to a $(1/δ)$-approximate neighbor without backtracking. Building on this foundation, we design an error-bounded top-$k$ ANN search algorithm that adaptively controls approximation accuracy during query time. To make the framework practical at scale, we introduce $δ$-EMQG (Error-bounded Monotonic Quantized Graph), a localized and degree-balanced variant with near-linear construction complexity. We further integrate vector quantization to accelerate distance computation while preserving theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on the ANN-Benchmarks dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Under a recall requirement of 0.99, our algorithm achieves 19,000 QPS on the SIFT1M dataset, outperforming other methods by more than 40\%.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RASTP通过删除不重要的token来减少生成式推荐系统的计算开销，同时保持或略微提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式推荐系统使用语义标识符(SIDs)表示物品，导致输入序列长度显著增加，增加了计算复杂性和内存消耗。

Method: RASTP通过结合表示幅度和注意力中心性来评估token的重要性，从而动态地删除低信息量或不相关的语义token。

Result: 在三个真实世界的Amazon数据集上的实验表明，RASTP减少了26.7%的训练时间，同时保持或略微提高了推荐性能。

Conclusion: RASTP通过token剪枝在减少计算开销的同时，维持甚至提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.

Conclusion: CLLMRec能够生成真正具有认知感知和个性化的概念推荐，且无需依赖显式的结构先验知识。

Abstract: The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.

*Zhan Su,Fengran Mo,Jian-yun Nie*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数检索增强生成 (PRAG) 范例，通过使用 LoRA 适配器参数化文档，将外部知识直接集成到大型语言模型 (LLM) 中，与传统的 RAG 方法相比，降低了推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 PRAG 方法采用一对一的文档编码方案，每个文档使用一个专用的 LoRA 适配器，导致数据稀缺，并且在推理过程中产生高开销，因为需要将 LLM 权重与每个候选段落的新 LoRA 适配器合并。

Method: 提出了一种新的在 PRAG 中编码段落的范例，该范例利用潜在路由编码过程 (Poly-PRAG)。在离线编码期间，我们将一组文档的编码视为多任务学习过程，其中每个段落都分配有一个唯一的任务标识符。通过采用路由函数，我们使用一小组潜在的 LoRA 适配器来编码整个段落空间。在在线推理期间，此路由函数根据输入查询选择性地激活一部分潜在专家。

Result: 在多个知识密集型 NLP 任务中对 Poly-PRAG 进行了全面评估。大量的实验表明了该方法的有效性，在四个不同的数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Poly-PRAG 是一种有效的参数检索增强生成方法，它通过潜在路由编码过程克服了传统 PRAG 方法的局限性，并在多个知识密集型 NLP 任务中取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PRAG) is a novel RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into a Large Language Model (LLM) by parameterizing documents using LoRA adapters, demonstrating reduced inference costs compared to traditional RAG approaches. However, current PRAG approaches adopt a \textbf{one-to-one} document encoding scheme, using a dedicated LoRA adapter for each individual document. This scheme introduces two major limitations: First, it leads to data scarcity, as the training datasets for individual LoRA adapters are limited. Second, it incurs high overhead during inference, requiring the merging of LLM weights with a new LoRA adapter for every candidate passage, which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding passages in PRAG that utilizes a latent routing encoding process (Poly-PRAG). During offline encoding, we treat the encoding of a set of documents as a multi-task learning process, where each passage is assigned a unique task identifier. By employing a routing function, we use a small set of latent LoRA adapters to encode the entire passage space. During online inference, this routing function selectively activates a subset of latent experts based on the input query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of Poly-PRAG across multiple knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results on four distinct datasets.

TL;DR: PepBridge is a novel framework for joint protein surface and structure design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing diverse and physically realistic protein structures and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge.

Method: Uses denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces, predicts the corresponding structure using a multi-model diffusion model, and uses Shape-Frame Matching Networks to ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture.

Result: Generates structurally viable proteins across diverse protein design scenarios.

Conclusion: Represents a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are governed by surface complementarity and hydrophobic interactions at protein interfaces. However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility. Extensive validation across diverse protein design scenarios demonstrates PepBridge's efficacy in generating structurally viable proteins, representing a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.

Conclusion: DDTime通过解决时间序列预测中数据集蒸馏的关键挑战，实现了显著的性能提升，并具有广泛的适用性和稳定性。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.
  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.

Conclusion: 当涉及强大的语言模型时，显式的结构先验通常是不必要的，在某些情况下甚至会适得其反。挑战了结构对于基于llm的图推理本质上有益的基本假设，为新的、语义驱动的图学习方法打开了大门。

Abstract: Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在各种评估场景中都有效且鲁棒。

Conclusion: CroTad 能够有效应对现有轨迹异常检测方法的挑战，并在实际应用中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: GCL-OT在异质图上实现了有效和鲁棒的结构-文本对齐，并通过理论分析证明了其可以提高互信息界和贝叶斯误差保证。

Abstract: Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: FlashCache：一种新颖的、频率域引导的、感知异常值的多模态 KV 缓存压缩框架，它优于现有的方法，并在保持任务性能的同时，实现了高达 1.69 倍的解码速度和 80% 的 KV 内存使用率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态 KV 缓存压缩方法大多依赖于注意力分数来减少缓存大小，这与已建立的有效注意力内核（例如，FlashAttention）不兼容，并且忽略了值向量对注意力输出的贡献。

Method: FlashCache 是一种频率域引导的、感知异常值的 KV 缓存压缩框架，它包含一个异常值 KV 识别模块，用于对频率域中多模态 KV 矩阵的主要成分进行建模，并优先保留与该主要成分显着偏离的 KV 对。此外，动态预算分配模块旨在自适应地确定每层 KV 缓存大小，以保留更多的异常值 KV。

Conclusion: FlashCache 是一种有效且高效的多模态 KV 缓存压缩框架，它优于现有方法，并且可以潜在地提高各种 MLLM 应用的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.

Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的MIL方法违反了严格的逻辑约束，导致性能指标虚高和泛化能力差。

Method: 设计了一个学习编码器，将输入实例转换为VSA兼容的向量，并使用VSA驱动的MaxNetwork分类器。

Result: 在标准MIL基准和医学成像数据集上，该方法实现了最先进的结果，同时保持了对MIL公式的严格遵守。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种有原则的、可解释的和有效的替代方案，以替代依赖于学习启发式的现有MIL方法。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.

Abstract: In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和测量人工智能安全级别（ASL）的威胁对于指导利益相关者实施安全措施至关重要，尤其是在生物安全领域，ASL-3+模型能够提升新手非国家行为者的能力，构成独特的风险。

Method: 论文提出了一种可解释且双重可扩展的指标MOCET，该指标可以自动且开放地量化现实世界中的风险。

Result: 论文介绍了MOCET指标。

Conclusion: MOCET指标旨在弥补现有评估指标的不足，更好地评估LLMs在现实世界中构成的风险，并跟上LLMs快速发展的步伐。

Abstract: Evaluating and measuring AI Safety Level (ASL) threats are crucial for guiding stakeholders to implement safeguards that keep risks within acceptable limits. ASL-3+ models present a unique risk in their ability to uplift novice non-state actors, especially in the realm of biosecurity. Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize "real-world risks" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ManifoldFormer: a geometric deep learning framework for EEG analysis that learns neural manifold representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG foundation models ignore the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics, limiting representation quality and cross-subject generalization.

Method: A Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs.

Result: Improved accuracy by 4.6-4.8% and Cohen's Kappa by 6.2-10.2% over state-of-the-art methods, with robust cross-subject generalization.

Conclusion: Geometric constraints are essential for effective EEG foundation models.

Abstract: Existing EEG foundation models mainly treat neural signals as generic time series in Euclidean space, ignoring the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics that constrains brain activity to low-dimensional manifolds. This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization. The geometric approach reveals meaningful neural patterns consistent with neurophysiological principles, establishing geometric constraints as essential for effective EEG foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer、Transformer++和Mamba三种架构的六个序列模型在大型瑞典心力衰竭(HF)队列(N = 42820)中进行了研究，为临床相关案例研究提供了依据。通过对基于ehr的输入患者序列、架构模型配置和数据收集的时间预处理技术进行消融研究，从而为使用ehr的临床预测任务的未来模型开发奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前医学领域缺乏系统性的方法来实证分析各种设置下模型性能和效率。虽然Transformer和Mamba等架构表现出色，但需要在医疗领域进行更深入的分析。

Method: 在大型瑞典心力衰竭队列中，研究了三种架构（Transformers、Transformers++、Mambas）的六个序列模型。患者数据包括从住院EHR中提取的诊断、生命体征、实验室、药物和程序。模型在三个一年预测任务中进行了评估：首次HF住院后的临床不稳定（再入院表型）、首次HF住院后的死亡率和最近一次住院后的死亡率。消融研究考虑了基于EHR的输入患者序列、架构模型配置和数据收集的时间预处理技术的修改。

Result: Llama在所有任务中都实现了最高的预测区分度、最佳校准和鲁棒性，其次是Mambas。这两种架构都展示了高效的表示学习，微小的配置超过了其他大型Transformer。在相同的模型大小下，Llama和Mambas使用少25%的训练数据实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了第一个消融研究，其中包含输入token化、模型配置和时间数据预处理的系统设计选择。使用EHR的临床预测任务的未来模型开发可以基于本研究的建议作为起点。

Abstract: Transformers have defined the state-of-the-art for clinical prediction tasks involving electronic health records (EHRs). The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point.

*Zijian Zhang,Xinyu Chen,Yuanjie Shi,Liyuan Lillian Ma,Zifan Xu,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的序数一致预测（CP）方法，该方法提供实例级别的最佳预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序数CP方法主要集中在启发式算法或限制性地要求底层模型预测序数标签上的单峰分布，因此，它们对覆盖率-效率的权衡提供的见解有限，或者缺乏CP方法所青睐的模型无关和分布自由的特性。

Method: 将一致序数分类公式化为实例级别的最小长度覆盖问题，并开发了一种滑动窗口算法来解决这个问题，该算法在每个校准数据上都是最优的，并且在标签候选者的数量K中只有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在来自不同领域的四个基准数据集上进行的实验表明，所提出的方法比基线方法在预测效率方面有显著提高（在四个数据集上平均降低15%）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的序数CP方法，该方法在模型无关性、预测效率和覆盖率保证方面都具有优势。

Abstract: Ordinal classification has been widely applied in many high-stakes applications, e.g., medical imaging and diagnosis, where reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for decision making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).

TL;DR: 本研究利用被动声学监测(PAM)和机器学习(ML)/深度学习(DL)模型，通过分析龙虾的生物声学特征来对其年龄和性别进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测难以捉摸的海洋物种（如龙虾）是一项挑战。了解龙虾的栖息地、福利、繁殖、性别和年龄对于管理和保护至关重要。

Method: 在苏格兰Johnshaven使用水听器收集数据，使用Mel频率倒谱系数(MFCCs)作为特征，探索了深度学习(DL)模型(1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN)和六种机器学习(ML)模型(SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP)的功效。

Result: 对于年龄分类，大多数模型达到了97%以上的准确率（Naive Bayes: 91.31%）。对于性别分类，除Naive Bayes外的所有模型都超过了93.23%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，有监督的ML和DL有潜力从龙虾的声音中提取与年龄和性别相关的特征。这项研究为龙虾保护、探测以及水产养殖和渔业管理提供了一种有前景的非侵入式PAM方法。

Abstract: Monitoring aquatic species, especially elusive ones like lobsters, presents challenges. This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).
  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.
  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds. This research offers a promising non-invasive PAM approach for lobster conservation, detection, and management in aquaculture and fisheries, enabling real-world edge computing applications for underwater species.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人工神经网络（ANNs）的任务性能提升是否使其内部表征更接近大脑信号，尤其是在听觉领域。通过量化36个不同音频模型的内部表征与来自两个独立fMRI数据集的大脑活动之间的对齐，发现近期在各种下游任务中表现出色的自监督音频模型比早期模型更能预测听觉皮层活动。模型在HEAREval基准测试中的整体任务性能与其与大脑表征的对齐之间存在强烈的正相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定提高人工神经网络（ANN）的任务性能是否也会使其内部表征更类似于大脑信号。

Method: 使用体素和成分回归，以及表征相似性分析（RSA），量化36个不同音频模型的内部表征与来自两个独立fMRI数据集的大脑活动之间的对齐。

Result: 近期在各种下游任务中表现出色的自监督音频模型比早期和更专业的模型更能预测听觉皮层活动。模型的整体任务性能与其与大脑表征的对齐之间存在显著的正相关（r>0.7）。大脑相似性逐渐增加，并在预训练早期出现。

Conclusion: 类脑表征可能是从自然音频数据中学习重建缺失信息的意外副产品。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly powerful models of brain computation, yet it remains unclear whether improving their task performance also makes their internal representations more similar to brain signals. To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.

TL;DR: 本研究旨在评估深度神经网络（DNN）在区分帕金森病（PD）患者和健康对照者方面的有效性，使用语音生物标志物，并与传统的机器学习（ML）方法进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病(PD)是一种进行性神经退行性疾病，除了直接损害功能性活动能力外，还常伴有声音障碍，如发声不足和构音障碍，这些通常在早期阶段表现出来。使用声音生物标志物来支持PD的早期诊断，在临床环境中提供了一种非侵入性的、低成本的和可访问的替代方案。

Method: 使用了两个公开的语音数据集，并从中提取了Mel频率倒谱系数(MFCCs)。使用1000次独立随机执行的验证策略评估模型的鲁棒性。使用分类统计评估性能。由于不满足正态性假设，因此应用非参数检验(Kruskal-Wallis和Bonferroni事后检验)来验证测试的分类模型在PD分类中是否相似或不同。

Result: DNN在意大利语音数据集和帕金森远程监控数据集上的平均准确率分别为98.65%和92.11%，与传统的ML模型相比，DNN表现出优越的性能和效率，同时在与相关研究进行基准测试时，也取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 本研究证实了dnn的效率，并强调了它们在利用基于语音的生物标志物，为神经退行性疾病的早期检测提供更高的准确性和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that, in addition to directly impairing functional mobility, is frequently associated with vocal impairments such as hypophonia and dysarthria, which typically manifest in the early stages. The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\%$ and $92.11\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks approaches suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability.

Method: a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph

Result: achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models

Conclusion: Topologic Attention Networks enable unified reasoning over local and global relationships.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks rely on local message passing, which limits their ability to model long-range dependencies in graphs. Existing approaches extend this range through continuous-time dynamics or dense self-attention, but both suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability. We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships. This method achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Marshall-Rosenhoover/Topologic-Attention-Networks.

Motivation: 现有 LLM 选择方法通常只优化单一目标，且无法从交互数据中学习个体用户偏好。

Method: 将交互数据转换为异构图，利用图中节点间的关系来捕捉用户查询和最佳 LLM 之间的上下文信息。

Result: 在两个模拟策略下，PersonalizedRouter 显著优于现有 LLM 选择方法，性能分别提升 15.38% 和 9.83%。

Conclusion: PersonalizedRouter 表现出强大的少样本泛化能力，在适应新用户和新 LLM 时，能够达到完全训练模型性能的 64.81% 和 85.80%。

Abstract: The growing number of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities and response styles provides users with a wider range of choices, which presents challenges in selecting appropriate LLMs, as user preferences vary in terms of performance, cost, and response style. Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.

Abstract: Early detection of rising talents is of paramount importance in the field of advertising. In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice. Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics. However, by utilizing the concept of talent breakout, we are able to assess the true forecasting ability of the models, where neural networks outperform traditional and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision and recall.

TL;DR: PepEVOLVE是一个用于优化环状肽的框架，它能学习编辑位置和动态优化肽序列，以实现多目标改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要预先指定可变位置进行优化，且依赖静态预训练和优化算法，限制了模型泛化能力和优化效果。

Method: PepEVOLVE通过动态masking和CHUCKLES shifting增强预训练，使用上下文无关的多臂bandit router发现高收益残基，并结合新颖的进化优化算法与group-relative advantage来稳定强化更新。

Result: 在Rev结合的环状肽benchmark测试中，PepEVOLVE优于PepINVENT，平均得分更高（约0.8 vs. 0.6），最佳候选得分达到0.95（vs. 0.87），并且在更少的步骤内收敛。

Conclusion: PepEVOLVE提供了一种实用的、可重复的肽先导优化路径，即使在最佳编辑位点未知的情况下，也能实现更高效的探索，并在多个目标上提高设计质量。

Abstract: Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.

*Angelina Yan,Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种心电信号分类流程，旨在解决可穿戴设备心电监测中信号频率和电池寿命的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态心电图是检测心律失常的金标准，但其短期、抽查的性质通常会错过间歇性事件。可穿戴心电图设备虽然可以实现长期监测，但由于电池的限制，采样频率较低且不规律，这给形态分析带来了挑战。

Method: 利用隐ODE模型对连续心电波形进行建模，并从高频单通道信号中提取鲁棒的特征向量。通过将初始360 Hz的心电信号降采样至90 Hz和45 Hz，为每个波形构建三个潜在向量。然后，使用梯度提升树对这些向量进行分类，并测试不同频率下的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，性能下降很小，在360 Hz、90 Hz和45 Hz下的宏平均AUC-ROC值分别为0.984、0.978和0.976，表明该方法可以避免信号保真度和电池寿命之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够减少可穿戴设备的大小，从而促进心脏健康的长期监测。

Abstract: 12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life. This enables smaller wearables, promoting long-term monitoring of cardiac health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工专利要求撰写劳动强度大，成本高，且不一致。传统LLM缺乏精确改进所需的结构化、迭代推理。

Method: 提出了Tree of Claims (ToC)框架，将权利要求编辑重新定义为引导搜索问题，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索 (MCTS) 和一个协作多代理系统。

Result: 在包含1145项权利要求的基准测试中，ToC在zero-shot和few-shot场景中显著优于标准LLM，平均综合评分提高了8%，在某些情况下高达9%。

Conclusion: ToC建立了一种透明、可控和可解释的方法，有效地将先进的LLM推理能力与战略性MCTS规划相结合，以实现结构化专利权利要求优化。

Abstract: Optimizing patent claims is a critical yet challenging task, demanding careful balance between maximizing novelty and preserving legal scope. Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\%, and up to 9\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions.

Motivation: 从理论上理解训练 DEQ 的梯度下降动力学仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。

Result: 证明了线性 DEQ 的守恒定律，这意味着参数在训练过程中保持在球面上，并利用这个性质表明梯度流在所有时间内都保持良好状态。然后，证明了在线性 DEQ 和深度平衡单指标模型中，在适当的初始化和足够小的步长下，梯度下降线性收敛到全局最小值。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for training infinitely deep weight-tied neural networks that achieve state of the art performance across many modern machine learning tasks. Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦多目标优化算法FIRM，用于解决大型语言模型对齐中的通信瓶颈和客户端不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多目标优化方法在大型模型中面临严重的通信瓶颈，并且集中式训练存在数据隐私问题。

Method: 每个客户端在本地解决一个正则化的多目标优化问题，通过客户端内正则化直接缓解客户端不一致漂移，无需传输多个梯度。

Result: FIRM算法收敛到Pareto静止点，并提供了有限时间收敛保证。实验表明，FIRM算法具有更平滑的训练动态、减少的客户端不一致漂移以及改进的奖励权衡。

Conclusion: FIRM算法能够在指定的偏好下平滑地调整目标之间的权衡。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values often involves balancing multiple, conflicting objectives such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.

*Zexi Tan,Xiaopeng Luo,Yunlin Liu,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC)方法，以解决多元时间序列(MTS)聚类中冗余信息导致性能瓶颈的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTS聚类方法受冗余信息干扰，无法有效关注关键时间戳。现有masking策略是独立的预处理步骤，无法动态适应聚类关键时间戳的重要性。

Method: 提出Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM)和Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV)表示学习模块。IVM自适应地引导模型学习更具区分性的聚类表示，MEV通过多视角互补防止masking过早收敛，并通过聚类引导的对比学习促进表示和聚类的联合优化。

Result: 在15个真实基准数据集上的大量实验表明，EMTC优于8种SOTA方法，EMTC比最强的基线平均提高了4.85%。

Conclusion: EMTC方法在多元时间序列聚类任务中表现出色，能够有效提升聚类性能。

Abstract: Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Kaplan scaling laws的GPU能耗预测方法，用于图像生成扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型图像生成计算需求快速增长，导致能源消耗和环境影响问题。

Method: 将扩散模型推理分解为文本编码、迭代去噪和解码组件，并假设去噪操作主导能耗。

Result: 在不同GPU架构上对四个先进的扩散模型进行了实验，结果表明，该能量缩放定律在各个架构中都具有较高的预测精度（R-squared > 0.9），并且具有很强的跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 验证了扩散推理的计算限制性质，并为可持续AI部署规划和碳足迹估算奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.

*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Step-E框架，用于在训练过程中集成样本选择和模型学习，以解决噪声标签和异常值对深度神经网络性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生环境中收集的训练数据常包含噪声标签和异常值，严重降低深度神经网络的性能和可靠性。传统的数据清洗方法无法充分利用下游模型的反馈，也无法适应未知的噪声模式。

Method: Step-E通过损失对样本进行排序，并逐渐增加被排除在梯度更新之外的高损失样本的比例，从而形成一个在线课程，关注简单且一致的样本，最终忽略持续存在的异常值。

Result: 在CIFAR-100N数据集上，Step-E将ResNet-18模型的测试精度从43.3%提高到50.4%，优于其他方法，并接近干净标签的性能。在CIFAR-10N数据集上，Step-E也优于噪声基线，并几乎与干净标签的性能相匹配。

Conclusion: Step-E框架能够有效地处理噪声标签和异常值，提高深度神经网络的性能，且训练时间开销适中。

Abstract: Training data collected in the wild often contain noisy labels and outliers that substantially degrade the performance and reliability of deep neural networks. While data cleaning is commonly applied as a separate preprocessing stage, such two-stage pipelines neither fully exploit feedback from the downstream model nor adapt to unknown noise patterns. We propose Step-E, a simple framework that integrates sample selection and model learning into a single optimization process. At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%). On CIFAR-10N (aggre), Step-E also improves over the noisy baseline (85.3% vs. 83.9%) and nearly matches the clean-label oracle (85.9%), with only moderate training-time overhead.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用精确分子指纹代替压缩指纹是否能提高分子性质预测和贝叶斯优化的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 哈希冲突会导致不同的子结构用相同的特征表示，从而导致分子相似性计算的过高估计。

Method: 使用高斯过程作为底层预测模型，比较精确指纹和标准压缩指纹在分子性质预测和贝叶斯优化中的性能。

Result: 在DOCKSTRING数据集的五个分子性质预测基准上，使用精确指纹在预测准确性方面产生了一小但一致的改进。然而，这些收益并没有转化为贝叶斯优化性能的显著提高。

Conclusion: 使用精确指纹可以提高分子性质预测的准确性，但对贝叶斯优化的影响不大。

Abstract: Molecular fingerprinting methods use hash functions to create fixed-length vector representations of molecules. However, hash collisions cause distinct substructures to be represented with the same feature, leading to overestimates in molecular similarity calculations. We investigate whether using exact fingerprints improves accuracy compared to standard compressed fingerprints in molecular property prediction and Bayesian optimization where the underlying predictive model is a Gaussian process. We find that using exact fingerprints yields a small yet consistent improvement in predictive accuracy on five molecular property prediction benchmarks from the DOCKSTRING dataset. However, these gains did not translate to significant improvements in Bayesian optimization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）作为工具使用代理时，其对齐训练的新表现，特别是模型可能以违背用户意愿或明确指示的方式使用工具的问题。

Method: 引入了一套多样且真实的 staged misconduct 场景评估套件，以评估代理的举报行为。

Result: 发现：(1) 不同模型系列的举报频率差异很大；(2) 增加代理需要完成的任务的复杂性会降低举报倾向；(3) 在系统提示中鼓励代理以道德方式行事会大大提高举报率；(4) 通过提供更多工具和详细的工作流程，为模型提供更明显的非举报行为途径，会降低举报率。此外，通过测试模型评估意识验证了数据集的稳健性。

Conclusion: 模型在我们的设置中表现出比以往工作更低的评估意识。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种理论上合理且简单的解决方案，可以减轻副作用，并且可以附加到现有的基于梯度的卸载程序。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.

Motivation: AVHRR GAC数据的粗糙空间分辨率限制了其在分析北极地区精细尺度的永久冻土动态和其他地表过程中的应用。

Method: 使用基于深度各向异性扩散模型的超分辨率算法，将AVHRR GAC数据降尺度到1公里，该模型使用MODIS LST数据进行训练，并以高分辨率土地覆盖、数字高程和植被高度图为指导。

Result: 生成了一个42年的泛北极LST数据集，该数据集提供整个泛北极地区超过四十年的每日两次、1公里分辨率的LST观测数据。

Conclusion: 该数据集能够改进永久冻土建模、近地表气温重建和格陵兰冰盖表面质量平衡评估，并支持前MODIS时代的 Arctic 气候监测工作。

Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) crucial for understanding land-atmosphere energy exchange and monitoring climate change, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.

Motivation: 表面肌电图(sEMG)提供了关于肌肉功能的重要见解，但它可能存在噪声并且难以获取。惯性测量单元(IMU)为运动捕捉系统提供了一种强大且可穿戴的替代方案。

Method: 基于扩张因果卷积的滑动窗口Wave-Net模型被训练以将IMU数据映射到sEMG信号。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了使用深度学习从IMU数据合成sEMG信号以进行肌肉意图检测的可行性，特别是在时间保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides vital insights into muscle function, but it can be noisy and challenging to acquire. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) provide a robust and wearable alternative to motion capture systems. This paper investigates the synthesis of normalized sEMG signals from 6-axis IMU data using a deep learning approach. We collected simultaneous sEMG and IMU data sampled at 1~KHz for various arm movements. A Sliding-Window-Wave-Net model, based on dilated causal convolutions, was trained to map the IMU data to the sEMG signal. The results show that the model successfully predicts the timing and general shape of muscle activations. Although peak amplitudes were often underestimated, the high temporal fidelity demonstrates the feasibility of using this method for muscle intent detection in applications such as prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback.

Abstract: The paper introduces DelTriC (Delaunay Triangulation Clustering), a clustering algorithm which integrates PCA/UMAP-based projection, Delaunay triangulation, and a novel back-projection mechanism to form clusters in the original high-dimensional space. DelTriC decouples neighborhood construction from decision-making by first triangulating in a low-dimensional proxy to index local adjacency, and then back-projecting to the original space to perform robust edge pruning, merging, and anomaly detection. DelTriC can outperform traditional methods such as k-means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN in many scenarios; it is both scalable and accurate, and it also significantly improves outlier detection.

Conclusion: TS-DFM 在未见过的分子和反应类型上具有很强的泛化能力，突出了其在促进反应探索方面的潜力。

Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, yet their exploration is limited by the complexity of experimental and computational approaches. Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.

Conclusion: FlexiFlow可以成功转移到蛋白质条件配体生成任务，即使数据集仅包含没有伴随构象的静态口袋。

Abstract: Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers used for scientific simulation often violate governing equation constraints. While linear constraints can be projected cheaply, many constraints are nonlinear, complicating projection onto the feasible set. Dynamical PDEs are especially difficult because constraints induce long-range dependencies in time. In this work, we evaluate two training-free, post hoc projections of approximate solutions: a nonlinear optimization-based projection, and a local linearization-based projection using Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products. We analyze constraints across representative PDEs and find that both projections substantially reduce violations and improve accuracy over physics-informed baselines.

Abstract: Premium automotive manufacturers face increasingly complex forecasting challenges due to high product variety, sparse variant-level data, and volatile market dynamics. This study addresses monthly automobile demand forecasting across a multi-product, multi-market, and multi-level hierarchy using data from a German premium manufacturer. The methodology combines point and probabilistic forecasts across strategic and operational planning levels, leveraging ensembles of LightGBM models with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and a mixed-integer linear programming reconciliation approach. Results highlight that spatiotemporal dependencies, as well as rounding bias, significantly affect forecast accuracy, underscoring the importance of integer forecasts for operational feasibility. Shapley analysis shows that short-term demand is reactive, shaped by life cycle maturity, autoregressive momentum, and operational signals, whereas medium-term demand reflects anticipatory drivers such as online engagement, planning targets, and competitive indicators, with online behavioral data considerably improving accuracy at disaggregated levels.

TL;DR: SAVeD: a contrastive learning framework for identifying versions of structured datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of repeated labor in data science due to difficulty in identifying similar datasets or transformations.

Method: Uses a modified SimCLR pipeline with augmented table views and a custom transformer encoder to contrast in latent space.

Result: Demonstrates substantial gains post-training on five datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, achieving higher accuracy and separation scores.

Conclusion: SAVeD can distinguish semantically altered versions and achieves competitive or superior results compared to baselines and prior methods.

Abstract: Our work introduces SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection), a contrastive learning-based framework for identifying versions of structured datasets without relying on metadata, labels, or integration-based assumptions. SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions. Compared to untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art dataset-discovery methods like Starmie, our custom encoder achieves competitive or superior results.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as an effective technique for fine-tuning large-scale foundation models for downstream tasks. However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.

Abstract: Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.

*Wei-Kai Chang,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个线性稳定性框架，用于分析深度学习中 SGD、随机扰动和 SAM 的行为，特别是在两层 ReLU 网络中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解深度学习中优化的动态过程越来越重要，因为模型在不断扩展。虽然随机梯度下降（SGD）及其变体能够可靠地找到泛化良好的解决方案，但驱动这种泛化的机制仍不清楚。值得注意的是，这些算法通常更喜欢更平坦或更简单的最小值，尤其是在过度参数化的设置中。之前的工作已经将平坦性与泛化联系起来，而像 Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) 这样的方法明确地鼓励平坦性，但仍然缺乏一个统一的理论来连接数据结构、优化动态和学习解决方案的性质。

Method: 我们开发了一个线性稳定性框架，该框架分析了 SGD、随机扰动和 SAM 的行为，特别是在两层 ReLU 网络中。

Result: 我们的分析的核心是一种相干性度量，它可以量化梯度曲率在数据点上的对齐程度，从而揭示为什么某些最小值是稳定的并且在训练过程中受到青睐。

Conclusion: 中心是相干性度量，它量化了梯度曲率在数据点上的对齐程度，揭示了为什么某些最小值是稳定的并在训练期间受到青睐。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of optimization in deep learning is increasingly important as models scale. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants reliably find solutions that generalize well, the mechanisms driving this generalization remain unclear. Notably, these algorithms often prefer flatter or simpler minima, particularly in overparameterized settings. Prior work has linked flatness to generalization, and methods like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) explicitly encourage flatness, but a unified theory connecting data structure, optimization dynamics, and the nature of learned solutions is still lacking. In this work, we develop a linear stability framework that analyzes the behavior of SGD, random perturbations, and SAM, particularly in two layer ReLU networks. Central to our analysis is a coherence measure that quantifies how gradient curvature aligns across data points, revealing why certain minima are stable and favored during training.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的coreset选择框架，可以有效解决现有梯度方法的局限性，并在实验中取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: As deep learning models continue to scale, the growing computational demands have amplified the need for effective coreset selection techniques. Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.
  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. We also present a novel convergence analysis for our sampling-based coreset selection method. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our approach achieves faster training and enhanced generalization across diverse datasets than the current state of the art.

Conclusion: 统一的单阶段判别挖掘有潜力作为可扩展和可解释的图表示学习的基础。

Abstract: Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要关注表示的一阶和二阶统计量，而忽略了底层数据流形的局部几何结构。

Method: 该方法保留了标准的双视图编码器-投影器架构，并使用Barlow Twins风格的冗余减少损失，但增加了一个基于曲率的正则化器。通过计算每个嵌入及其k个最近邻的余弦交互来定义离散曲率得分，并在曲率导出的矩阵上使用Barlow风格的损失来对齐和去相关化这些得分。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用ResNet-18骨干网络的实验表明，与Barlow Twins和VICReg相比，曲率正则化的SSL产生了有竞争力的或改进的线性评估性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，显式地塑造局部几何结构是对纯粹的统计SSL正则化器的简单而有效的补充。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.

Conclusion: MAPT框架能够有效地解决MVDPDPSR问题，并在性能和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the cooperative Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) and proposes an end-to-end centralized decision-making framework based on sequence-to-sequence, named Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT). MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.

Motivation: 现有的基于prompt的持续学习方法在领域转移下表现不佳，存在表征漂移问题，导致遗忘。

Method: InTAct通过捕获先前学习任务的特征激活范围，并约束更新以确保网络在这些区域内保持一致性，从而在共享层中保留功能行为。

Result: 在各种领域增量基准测试中，InTAct 减少了表征漂移并提高了性能，在 DomainNet 和 ImageNet-R 上，平均准确率比最先进的基线提高了 8 个百分点。

Conclusion: InTAct 通过调节编码过去知识的表征变化，实现了稳定性和可塑性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法无需进行大量预处理，从而释放了便携式、可部署的MALDI-MS平台的潜力，彻底改变了环境病原体检测和对生物威胁的快速反应。

Abstract: Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

Result: 证明了该方法在高概率下保证正确的聚类。此外，表明为每个集群学习的策略的次优性差距与集群的大小成反比，与先前基于协作学习的控制工作不同，没有额外的偏差。

Conclusion: 揭示了如何使用聚类在数据驱动的控制中学习个性化策略，这些策略可以从协作中获得统计收益，但不会因包含来自不同过程的数据而导致次优。

Abstract: It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.
