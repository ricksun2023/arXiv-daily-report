*Isaac Shi,Zeyuan Li,Fan Liu,Wenli Wang,Lewei He,Yang Yang,Tianyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEREK 模块是一个安全且可扩展的检索增强生成管道，专为企业文档问答而设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要安全、可审计和上下文忠实的检索。

Method: 该系统摄取异构内容（PDF、Office、网络），将其拆分为 1,000 个 token 的重叠块，并在混合 HNSW+BM25 存储中对其进行索引。用户查询由 GPT-4o 细化，通过组合向量+BM25 搜索检索，使用 Cohere 重新排序，并由 LLM 使用 CO-STAR 提示工程回答。LangGraph 验证器强制执行引用重叠，重新生成答案，直到每个声明都有根据。

Result: 在四个 LegalBench 子集上，1000 个 token 的块将 Recall@50 大约提高了 1 个百分点，混合+重新排序将 Precision@10 大约提高了 7 个百分点；验证器将 TRACe 利用率提高到 0.50 以上，并将不支持的语句限制在 3% 以下。

Conclusion: DEREK模块提供准确、可追溯且可用于生产的文档问答，且运营开销极小。该模块旨在满足企业对安全、可审计和上下文忠实的检索需求，为法律和金融等高风险领域提供可靠的基线。

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge)
Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed
specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and
implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,
web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a
hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via
combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using
CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,
regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,
1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank
boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe
Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All
components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These
results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and
production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is
designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful
retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal
and finance.

### [2] [Adversarial Demonstration Learning for Low-resource NER Using Dual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15864)
*Guowen Yuan,Tien-Hsuan Wu,Lianghao Xia,Ben Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的低资源 NER 方法，该方法通过双重相似性选择示例并使用对抗性演示进行训练，从而优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定了论证构建和模型训练中的两个问题：现有方法主要依赖语义相似性，并且 NER 标注器引用论证示例的能力通常不足。

Method: 提出了一种通过双重相似性选择示例以及使用对抗性演示训练 NER 模型的方法。

Result: 在低资源 NER 任务中进行了综合实验，结果表明该方法优于一系列方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在低资源 NER 任务中表现优于一系列方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration
learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration
construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting
demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that
feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly,
we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is
generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that
effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select
examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and
feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with
adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the
demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive
experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our
method outperforms a range of methods.

### [3] [Small Edits, Big Consequences: Telling Good from Bad Robustness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15868)
*Altynbek Ismailov,Salia Asanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are over-robust to underspecification but not sensitive enough to quantifier flips. The authors advocate for evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to overlook stray typos. This paper probes where useful robustness ends and harmful insensitivity begins.

Method: The authors compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal prompt perturbations: (i) progressive underspecification deleting 10% of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping a pivotal quantifier ('max' to 'min'); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including three 'reasoning-tuned' versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they reused the baseline solution or adapted.

Result: Models remain correct in 85% of cases even after 90% of the prompt is missing, yet only 54% react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie in between, passing through 56%.

Conclusion: Current LLMs blur the line between harmless noise and meaning-changing edits, often treating both as ignorable. Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re-evaluation. The authors advocate for evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when semantics truly change.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a
single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to
overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful
insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal
prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive
underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping
a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a
common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including
three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python
outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they
reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a
sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 %
of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet
only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with
reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie
in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between
harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.
Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We
advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential
sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when
semantics truly change.

### [4] [Enhancing Hindi NER in Low Context: A Comparative study of Transformer-based models with vs. without Retrieval Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16002)
*Sumit Singh,Rohit Mishra,Uma Shanker Tiwary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study shows that using Retrieval Augmentation (RA) with pretrained models improves Hindi NER, especially when data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Named Entity Recognition (NER) in natural language processing, especially for languages with limited resources like Hindi.

Method: Fine-tuned Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and Generative Models (Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, Llama-3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo) with and without Retrieval Augmentation (RA).

Result: RA improves macro F1 scores for MuRIL (0.69 to 0.70) and XLM-R (0.495 to 0.71). Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms the baseline. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA well, but Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not effectively adopt RA with the retrieval context.

Conclusion: Retrieval Augmentation (RA) significantly improves NER performance, especially for low-context data. The study provides insights on using data augmentation and pretrained models to enhance NER performance, particularly in low-resource languages.

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity
recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual
input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique
that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and
Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf
(Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments
the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from
Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA.
However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER
generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)
with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't
incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69
and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,
respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B
by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not
fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA
well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval
context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,
especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about
how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER
performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

### [5] [Learning without training: The implicit dynamics of in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16003)
*Benoit Dherin,Michael Munn,Hanna Mazzawi,Michael Wunder,Javier Gonzalvo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can learn new patterns at inference time. We show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms through which Large Language Models (LLM) learn in context are still largely unknown.

Method: Theory and experimentation.

Result: A transformer block implicitly transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

Conclusion: Transformer blocks can implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context.

Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their
ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn
new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are
presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were
not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are
still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a
self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly
modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through
theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why
LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show
under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly
transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

### [6] [Help Me Write a Story: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Generate Writing Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16007)
*Hannah Rashkin,Elizabeth Clark,Fantine Huot,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the ability of LLMs to give writing feedback, finding they are often accurate but fail to identify the biggest issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explore the challenges and limitations of model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and evaluation frameworks.

Method: present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics.

Result: models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects -- providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback

Conclusion: current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects -- providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

Abstract: Can LLMs provide support to creative writers by giving meaningful writing
feedback? In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of
model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and
evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we
present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally
introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in
this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows
that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects --
providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often
fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide
when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

### [7] [mRAKL: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Graph Construction for Low-Resourced Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16011)
*Hellina Hailu Nigatu,Min Li,Maartje ter Hoeve,Saloni Potdar,Sarah Chasins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mRAKL, a RAG-based system for multilingual knowledge graph construction (mKGC), reformulating it as a question answering task. Experiments on low-resource languages Tigrinya and Amharic show improved accuracy compared to no-context settings, especially with an idealized retrieval system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting.

Method: Reformulate the mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. Use the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Use BM25 retriever.

Result: RAG-based approach improves performance over a no-context setting. With an idealized retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

Conclusion: RAG-based approach improves performance over a no-context setting, and with an idealized retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs represent real-world entities and the relationships between
them. Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of
automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for
knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the
mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve
this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having
our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily
on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using
higher-resourced languages Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer. With
a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over
a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized
retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points
for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

### [8] [AutoMeet: a proof-of-concept study of genAI to automate meetings in automotive engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16054)
*Simon Baeuerle,Max Radyschevski,Ulrike Pado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: using genAI for transcribing meetings and integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable format for ad-hoc searches. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey data on both ethical and technical aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: frequent in-person meetings produce inconsistent documentation. Shared information therefore becomes hard to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and high-frequency meeting schedules.  This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable format for ad-hoc searches.

Method: implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through a chatbot interface

Result: Direct feedback from this real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.

Conclusion: users agree that the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI models, technical aspects are largely solved already, organizational aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system

Abstract: In large organisations, knowledge is mainly shared in meetings, which takes
up significant amounts of work time. Additionally, frequent in-person meetings
produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes,
presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard
to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and
high-frequency meeting schedules.
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language
processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management

integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable
format for ad-hoc searches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 TTD-DR 的新框架，该框架将研究报告生成概念化为一个扩散过程，通过结合外部信息和自我进化算法迭代细化初始草稿，从而在需要密集搜索和多跳推理的基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型 (LLM) 在使用通用测试时缩放算法生成复杂的长篇研究报告时，性能通常会停滞不前。

Method: Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR)

Result: TTD-DR实现了最先进的结果，显著优于现有的深度研究代理。

Conclusion: TTD-DR在需要密集搜索和多跳推理的各种基准测试中实现了最先进的结果，显著优于现有的深度研究代理。

Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly
advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,
long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing
inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles
of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep
Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report
generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a
preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation
to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through
a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism
that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is
further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of
the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the
diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process
more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative
search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and
multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

### [10] [RAVine: Reality-Aligned Evaluation for Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16725)
*Yilong Xu,Xiang Long,Zhi Zheng,Jinhua Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAVine 是一个用于评估智能体 LLM 搜索的现实对齐框架，它解决了现有评估方法的局限性，例如复杂查询、噪声ground truth和忽略迭代过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估框架未能与智能体搜索的目标很好地对齐。目前的基准测试中使用的复杂查询通常偏离了真实的用户搜索场景。先前的研究倾向于在提取端到端评估的真实数据时引入噪声，从而导致在细粒度层面上产生扭曲的评估。目前大多数框架只关注最终答案的质量，而忽略了对智能体搜索固有迭代过程的评估。

Method: 我们提出了 RAVine——一个与现实对齐的评估框架，用于对具有搜索功能的智能体LLM进行评估。

Result: RAVine 针对更好地反映用户意图的多点查询和长篇答案，并引入了一种可归因的真实数据构建策略，以提高细粒度评估的准确性。此外，RAVine 检查模型在整个迭代过程中与搜索工具的交互，并考虑效率因素。

Conclusion: 我们对一系列模型进行了基准测试，并得出了一些见解，我们希望这将有助于推动智能体搜索系统的发展。

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval
augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However,
existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic
search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often
deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to
introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,
leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current
frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the
evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address
these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework
for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form
answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground
truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.
Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the
iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a
series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will
contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

*Marlene Lutz,Indira Sen,Georg Ahnert,Elisa Rogers,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM难以准确模拟边缘化群体，提示策略的选择至关重要，较小模型有时表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格提示越来越多地用于大型语言模型（LLM）中，以模拟各种社会人口群体群体的观点。然而，人格提示的制定方式会显著影响结果，从而引发对此类模拟真实性的担忧。

Method: 系统地检验不同的角色扮演格式和人口统计启动策略如何影响LLM在开放式和封闭式任务中对15个交叉人口统计群体的模拟。

Result: 人口统计启动和角色扮演策略的选择会显著影响LLM的模拟结果。面试风格的提示和基于名称的启动可以帮助减少刻板印象和提高对齐度。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟边缘化群体时表现不佳，特别是对于非二元性别、西班牙裔和中东身份的群体。较小的模型（如OLMo-2-7B）表现优于较大的模型（如Llama-3.3-70B）。

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to
simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona
prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about
the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we
systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically
role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM
simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and
closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate
marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern
identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption
strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that
prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce
stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B
outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable
guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation
studies.

*Ondrej Bohdal,Mete Ozay,Jijoong Moon,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Hyeonmok Ko,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on on-device compositional multi-tasking, proposes a new benchmark and an efficient method called Learnable Calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on merging in LLMs has been limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. This paper focuses on text-based compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, particularly in on-device settings.

Method: The paper proposes Learnable Calibration, an efficient method tailored for on-device applications.

Result: The paper introduces a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a benchmark for compositional multi-tasking and an efficient method (Learnable Calibration) for on-device applications, advancing LLMs in real-world multi-tasking scenarios.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine
learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large
language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to
support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work
on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been
limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In
this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based
compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous
execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a
long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks
concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark
comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an
efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,
where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions
that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the
groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking
scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和系统未能解决Barishal、Noakhali和Chittagong等方言中发现的非正式和文化丰富的表达方式，导致检测能力有限和带有偏见的审核，使大部分有害内容未被考虑。

Method: 通过翻译和注释BD-SHS语料库中的9,183个实例，构建了首个多方言孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BIDWESH。

Result: BIDWESH数据集在语言上丰富、平衡且具有包容性，可用于推进孟加拉语中的仇恨言论检测。

Conclusion: BIDWESH数据集为孟加拉语仇恨言论检测的公平内容审核奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hate speech on digital platforms has become a growing concern globally,
especially in linguistically diverse countries like Bangladesh, where regional
dialects play a major role in everyday communication. Despite progress in hate
speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to
address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as
Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection
capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content
unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first
multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and
annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional
dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type
(slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual,
male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The
resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive
resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the
groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes
significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource
language settings.

Motivation: 现有证据表明大型语言模型(llm)显示出心理理论(ToM)能力。然而，人类的ToM也有助于动态地规划行动和战略性地干预他人的精神状态。

Method: 提出MindGames，一个新的“规划心智理论”(PToM)任务，需要智能体推断对话者的信念和愿望，来说服他们改变行为。

Result: 人类在PToM任务中明显优于o1-preview (LLM) (高11%;$p=0.006$)。O1-preview在基线条件下优于人类，基线条件需要类似数量的计划，但最小的精神状态推断。

Conclusion: LLMs在类似人类的社会推理方面与人类存在显著差距。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind
(ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial
role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human
ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically
intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning
theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's
beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous
evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans
significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;
$p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model
of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's
preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline
condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state
inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already
given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between
human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

TL;DR: 该研究关注LLM输出“未知”标签的原因，区分了模型无能和问题本身不确定性，并提出了一个量化和解决此问题的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估几乎完全侧重于LLM输出的“未知”标签是否诚实，而忽略了它们出现的原因。这模糊了两种不同的情况：(i) 真正不确定的输入和 (ii) 模型未能解决的可解问题。我们称这种现象为“模糊感知”。

Method: 该研究引入了一个框架，用于量化由模型无能导致的“未知”响应的比例，并测试引导刺激是否可以将它们转换为正确（“已知”）或内在不确定的结果。

Result: 该研究获得了不同LLM在推理任务上的理论准确性，并应用不同的方法来测试模型是否可以在给定的基线框架下达到该准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过区分不确定性的来源，更清晰地展示了LLM推理的局限性及其改进潜力，并探索了LLM的真正推理能力，为解决“模糊感知”现象提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, yet
current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are
\emph{honest} rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an
input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the
model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon \emph{Vague Perception}. And
thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of \emph{Unknown}
responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation
can convert them into either correct (\emph{Known}) or intrinsically
indeterminate outcomes. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method
provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for
improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different
LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the
accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the
true reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the
\emph{Vague Perception} phenomenon.

TL;DR: This paper introduces two demonstration selection strategies for many-shot ICL that improve performance and reduce inference costs compared to random selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed sets of random demonstrations are often selected in many-shot ICL due to high inference costs, caching benefits, and similar performance compared to other strategies when scaled, but there's room for improvement.

Method: Two demonstration selection strategies are proposed: (1) combining similarity-based selection with a large set of cached random demonstrations, and (2) replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering.

Result: Experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash show consistent outperformance of the proposed strategies compared to random selection, matching or surpassing the most performant approach, while supporting caching and reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: The proposed demonstration selection strategies outperform random selection, match or surpass the most performant selection approach, support caching, and reduce inference cost.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs
containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning
(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the
input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of
demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)
high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and
(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when
scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for
demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal
computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of
demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a
disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The
second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with
those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via
k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several
datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection
and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting
caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on
different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Conclusion: We propose FinResearchBench, a logic tree based Agent-as-a-Judge system specifically for financial research agents, covering 70 financial research questions across 7 task types.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in
professional research applications, such as STEM, software development,
finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as
it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity.
However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically

Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety.
To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based
Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It
provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across
7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of
this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system
that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the
intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust
evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research
questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve LLM-based math tutors by using a latent state representation of the student and optimizing a long-term policy, resulting in better long-term outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF frameworks optimize responses based on immediate turn-level human preferences, which is insufficient for multi-turn dialogue settings like online math tutoring.

Method: The authors propose a method to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state.

Result: The proposed modifications lead to improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks.

Conclusion: This paper shows that representing dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state and optimizing a long-term policy improves long-term outcomes in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on
immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in
multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method
to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a
lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a
long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The
goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of
guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our
model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of
training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next
utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to
improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring
tasks.

Result: The results show that even the most advanced models struggled significantly.

Conclusion: Even the most advanced LLMs struggled significantly in the experiment.

Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation
that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world
documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style
answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new
bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to
systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents
and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike
conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task
domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains,
requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input
queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source
state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models
struggled significantly. The benchmark is available at

Conclusion: classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection

Abstract: The debate surrounding language identification has gained renewed attention
in recent years, especially with the rapid evolution of AI-powered language
models. However, the non-AI-based approaches to language identification have
been overshadowed. This research explores a mathematical implementation of an
algorithm for language determinism by leveraging monograms and bigrams
frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The datasets
used comprise texts varying in length, historical period, and genre, including
short stories, fairy tales, and poems. Despite these variations, the method
achieves over 80\% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches
100\% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. These results demonstrate
that classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable
alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLM vocabulary is often used to reduce input sequence length and alleviate attention's quadratic cost. Yet, current LLM architectures impose a critical bottleneck: the output projection layer scales linearly with vocabulary size, rendering substantial expansion impractical.

Method: decouples input and output vocabularies by predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. Each of the  k linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously, enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller, independent linear heads. A self-distillation approach is used for converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM.

Result: SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models.

Conclusion: SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. The approach provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support for underrepresented languages and domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing informal language-based LLMs trained with RL face a significant challenge: their verification processes are neither reliable nor scalable. It becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide human priors for supervising complex programming tasks.

Method: introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier

Result: SFT enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models.

Conclusion: RL with regularization improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models
(LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge:
their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are
neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models
could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted
alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous
formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,
Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their
reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving
large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to
employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the
reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes
unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex
programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human
priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot
study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data
curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the
formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional
formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification
reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models
(e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code,
surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves
performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and
outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this, we propose a hybrid AL framework

Method: a hybrid AL framework, termed PromptAL (Sample-Aware Dynamic Soft Prompts for Few-Shot Active Learning). This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution, thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently, based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more accurately represent the target distribution.

Result: PromptAL achieves superior performance over nine baselines on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets

Conclusion: PromptAL achieves superior performance over nine baselines on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL
methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the
decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently
identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the
empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target
distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal
position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in
enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target
distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of
samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,
we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware
Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning).
This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in
aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,
thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first
leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that
adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,
based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation
with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more
accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six
in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior
performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

Motivation: Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. Considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language.

Method: A Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in Dutch language models is introduced.

English models exhibit the most bias, whereas Dutch models the least amount of bias. Assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.

Conclusion: Various language models exhibit substantial bias across various bias categories. English models exhibit the most bias, whereas Dutch models the least amount of bias.

  Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and
harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of
these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of
recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language
models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A
Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in
Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463
sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation,
Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting
sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the
other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that
various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and
Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using
the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated
in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language
models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas
Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that
assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.
These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,
suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in
shaping model biases.

Method: 提出了一种新的指标，即ICR评分（信息贡献到残差流），它量化了模块对隐藏状态更新的贡献。在此基础上，提出了一种幻觉检测方法，即ICR探针，它捕获了隐藏状态的跨层演化。

Result: ICR评分在区分幻觉方面是有效和可靠的。实验结果表明，ICR探针以显著更少的参数实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: ICR探针通过捕获隐藏状态的跨层演化，实现了卓越的性能，且参数显著减少。消融研究和案例分析提供了对该方法底层机制的更深入理解，提高了其可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

### [29] [Combining Language and Topic Models for Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16490)
*Jaco du Toit,Marcel Dunaiski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether combining features from PLMs and topic models benefits Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC). It finds that using topic model features generally decreases performance compared to only using PLM features, suggesting that incorporating topic model features for text classification should not be automatically assumed to be beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent HTC approaches use various techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks.

Method: a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a classification model. the extracted features are passed through separate convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by weighing the most important features for each class separately

Result: using the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM

Conclusion: the incorporation of features extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed beneficial

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task
which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes
from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various
techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the
natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models
along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an
effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale
behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM
captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic
model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents
as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic
model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a
classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of
the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in
general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate
convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise
attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by
weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform
comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using
the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification
performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In
contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features
extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed
beneficial.

Motivation: 由于大规模测试导致的数据泄漏风险和评估效率低下，现有的科学基准在广泛的范围、广泛的覆盖面和高度的严格性方面取得了进展，但它们经常面临两个主要挑战。为了解决这些问题，

Method: 引入了动态基准EESE，旨在可靠地评估基础模型中的科学能力。我们的方法包括两个组成部分：1）一个非公开的EESE-Pool，包含超过10万个由专家构建的科学实例（问题-答案对），跨越5个学科和500多个子领域，通过确保范围、覆盖面和严格性的多阶段管道构建；2）一个定期更新的500个实例子集EESE，经过抽样和验证，以实现防泄漏、低开销的评估。

Conclusion: EESE提供了一个强大、可扩展且向前兼容的科学基准设计解决方案，可以真实地衡量基础模型处理科学问题的能力。

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating
their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science
benchmarks have made progress towards broad **Range**, wide **Reach**, and high
**Rigor**, yet they often face two major challenges: **data leakage risks**
that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to
large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving
Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess
scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two
components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed
science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+
subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**,
and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled
and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.
Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE
effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific
fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and
forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic
measure of how well foundation models handle science questions. The project

Motivation: 探讨句子级质量评估(QE)在英汉机器翻译后期编辑(MTPE)中的作用。

Method: 通过研究QE对英汉机器翻译后期编辑的影响，包括后期编辑速度和学生翻译的感知，以及QE与MT质量、QE与翻译专业知识之间的交互效应。

Result: QE显著减少了后期编辑时间。交互效应不显著，表明QE一致地提高了中、高质量MT输出以及不同水平的学生翻译的MTPE效率。QE在MTPE中具有多种功能，例如验证翻译人员对MT质量的评估并使他们能够仔细检查翻译输出。不准确的QE可能会阻碍后期编辑过程。

Conclusion: QE可以提高翻译效率，但错误的QE可能会阻碍翻译过程。

Abstract: This preliminary study investigates the usefulness of sentence-level Quality
Estimation (QE) in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE),
focusing on its impact on post-editing speed and student translators'
perceptions. It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT
quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal
that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction
effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE
efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student
translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating
potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as
validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to
double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that
inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new
insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more
effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.

Method: 使用 GRASP 和 IntPhys 2 数据集对最先进的多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 在直觉物理任务上进行了系统评估。对模型嵌入进行了探测分析，提取关键处理阶段的中间表示，以检查任务相关信息保存的程度。

Result: 视觉编码器成功捕捉到物理合理性线索，但语言模型没有有效地利用这些信息，导致推理失败。视觉和语言之间出现不一致。

Conclusion: MLLMs 在直觉物理任务中的主要限制不是视觉组件，而是视觉和语言信息的无效整合。研究结果强调了视觉-语言对齐是未来 MLLM 开发的一个关键改进领域。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and
IntPhys 2 datasets. We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that
even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible
from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a
probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations
at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is
preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical
vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture
physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by
the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment
suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not
the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic
information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for
improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,
stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made
inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages

proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在生成和理解任务中存在自相矛盾的现象，即模型自己生成的图像与其自身理解的输入提示不一致。

Method: 定义了一个 Nonunified 分数来量化自相矛盾现象，并采用标准后训练方法（如 SFT、DPO）进行改进。

Result: 发现仅微调生成分支时，生成和理解之间存在共同改进效应；理论上，对齐的训练动态允许减少提示错位的生成，从而改善理解分支中的不匹配检测；提出了基于课程的策略，逐步引入更难的样本，从而实现更好的统一。

Conclusion: 利用内部监督和课程学习策略，可以提高 MLLM 的生成和理解能力，但需要注意数据质量，避免共同退化。

Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a
single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation
produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own
understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such
self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction
mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather
than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of
leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model
understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the
generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,
SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation
and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and
understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known
in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows
improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously
incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned
training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced
prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the
understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of
co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is
empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics
like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,
which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a
curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces
harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and
improved MLLM generation and understanding.

TL;DR: PICACO是一种新颖的多元化ICA方法，它优化了一种元指令，该指令可以驾驭多种价值观，从而更好地激发LLM对它们的理解并改善它们的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的上下文学习在使LLM与人类价值观保持一致方面显示出巨大的潜力，有助于减少有害输出并适应不同的偏好，而无需进行昂贵的后期训练，即上下文对齐（ICA）。然而，LLM对输入提示的理解仍然是不可知的，这限制了ICA解决价值冲突的能力——人类价值观本质上是多元的，通常会产生相互冲突的需求，例如，刺激与传统。因此，当前的ICA方法面临着指令瓶颈挑战，即LLM难以协调单个提示中的多个预期价值，从而导致不完整或有偏差的对齐。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的多元化ICA方法PICACO。PICACO优化了一种元指令，该指令可以驾驭多种价值观，从而更好地激发LLM对它们的理解并改善它们的对齐。

Result: 通过最大化指定值与LLM响应之间的总相关性来实现这一点，理论上可以增强价值相关性，同时减少分散注意力的噪声，从而产生有效的价值指令。

Conclusion: PICACO在五个价值集上进行了广泛的实验，表明其在黑盒和开源大型语言模型上表现良好，优于最近的一些强基线，并在多达8个不同的价值观之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate
diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment
(ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting
ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently
pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.
tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck
challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a
single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we
propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO
optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit
LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by
maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,
theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,
resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value
sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,
outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance
across up to 8 distinct values.

Motivation: The interaction mechanism between discourse markers (DMs) and non-DMs remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. DMs are crucial for creating coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs, and both can be ambiguous.

Method: Using the framework of eRST, correlation and regression analyses are conducted to examine whether polysemous DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals.

Result: Polysemous DMs co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, but the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

Conclusion: Polysemous DMs co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, but the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Genre significantly shapes DM-signal interactions.

Abstract: Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating
coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs
('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous
('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such
signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM
signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.
  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy,
and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous
DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings
reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the
total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover,
genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

TL;DR: TIM, with TIMRUN, overcomes LLM context limits using reasoning trees and subtask pruning, achieving high throughput and accurate reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have context limits that bottleneck reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The Thread Inference Model (TIM) is trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving. The TIMRUN inference runtime enables long-horizon structured reasoning. A rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism selects relevant context tokens.

Result: The system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges.

Conclusion: The Thread Inference Model (TIM) on TIMRUN achieves high inference throughput while manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache, delivering accurate reasoning and handling information retrieval challenges.

Abstract: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck
reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),
a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and
TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond
context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited
working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model
inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and
GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as
reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.
The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and
conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During
generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states
of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning
mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages
throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high
inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU
memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles
information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and
multi-hop tool use.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TTM, a training-free framework for role-playing language agents that decouples character features for controlled role-playing, achieving high-fidelity and stylistically consistent dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs is insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, and fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to data collection challenges and computational resource requirements.

Method: The paper proposes Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. The framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing.

Result: The TTM framework achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance and enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and variations in personality and memory.

Conclusion: The proposed Test-Time-Matching (TTM) framework achieves outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues, as demonstrated by human evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled
role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various
applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often
proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,
particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,
fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated
with data collection and the computational resources required for training,
thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we
propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework
through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to
automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and
linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation
pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves
high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations
across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.
We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate
that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive
and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically
engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning
capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial
applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic
financial task taxonomy with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness
assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy
knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous
data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware
optimization, tow-stage learning processes, and detailed attribution systems,
we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo
comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including FinEva,
FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500

Motivation: 开源社区主要关注数学和编码，而忽略了科学领域，这主要是由于缺乏开放、大规模、高质量、可验证的科学推理数据集。

Method: 介绍了TextbookReasoning和MegaScience两个数据集，并通过消融研究评估各种数据选择方法，为每个公开的科学数据集确定最佳子集。

Result: MegaScience数据集在性能和训练效率方面优于现有的开源科学数据集，并且在MegaScience上训练的Llama3.1、Qwen2.5和Qwen3系列基础模型在平均性能上明显优于相应的官方instruct模型。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting
human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery.
However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and
coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of
open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To
bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring
truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific
textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific
disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of
high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed
through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection
methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available
scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system
covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,
incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate
evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve
superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths
compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train
Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which
significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average
performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger

Motivation: 探索生成数据增强对目标重识别的影响，特别是在需要保留细粒度视觉细节的情况下。

Method: PAT++：将扩散自蒸馏融入到 Part-Aware Transformer 中。

Result: 使用 Urban Elements ReID Challenge 数据集进行的大量实验表明，使用生成图像进行模型训练和查询扩展会导致性能持续下降。

Conclusion: 生成图像增强在目标重识别任务中导致性能下降，因为生成图像无法保留身份定义特征，并且存在域偏移。

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

Motivation: 最先进的 logit 蒸馏方法表现出多功能性、简单性和效率。尽管取得了进展，但现有研究尚未深入研究 logit 知识中的细粒度关系。

Method: 提出了一种新的局部密集关系 Logit 蒸馏 (LDRLD) 方法，该方法通过递归解耦和重组 logit 信息来捕获类间关系，从而为学生学习提供更详细和清晰的见解。引入了一种自适应衰减权重 (ADW) 策略，该策略可以使用逆秩加权 (IRW) 和指数秩衰减 (ERD) 动态调整关键类别对的权重。在递归解耦后，提取剩余的非目标知识，以确保知识的完整性并提高性能。

Result: 我们的方法通过传递细粒度的知识并强调最重要的关系来提高学生的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在 CIFAR-100、ImageNet-1K 和 Tiny-ImageNet 等数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法与最先进的基于 logits 的蒸馏方法相比具有优势。

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

Result: 在包含 600 多个受试者的真实世界数据集上进行的实验结果表明，该框架有效地减轻了低质量人脸图像的影响，优于现有的人脸质量评估技术，同时保持了计算效率，准确率达到 96.67%。

Conclusion: 集成的质量评估模块可以提高人脸验证的性能，假拒绝率降低了 99.7%，并提高了余弦相似度分数。

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

Additionally, it proposes a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these tokens.

Result: The approach demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question answering (VQA), while reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Fast Nystr"om Attention (FNA), a training-free method for approximating self-attention in linear time and space, and a masking strategy to mitigate noise from massive and artifact tokens.

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spelke object concept for computer vision, presents the SpelkeBench dataset, and proposes SpelkeNet to extract Spelke segments from images. SpelkeNet outperforms existing methods and is useful for downstream applications like object manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast, developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like manipulation and planning.

Method: build SpelkeNet, a class of visual world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. These concepts are used for statistical counterfactual probing, where diverse virtual pokes are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics.

Result: SpelkeNet outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench and yields superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for physical object manipulation.

Conclusion: SpelkeNet outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench. The Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object manipulation models.

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种平衡的方法，称为语义和抽象特征破坏（SAFER），以提高对抗迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征级攻击主要操纵语义信息来推导权重矩阵。受 CNN 倾向于更多地关注高频分量的启发，验证了在高频空间中转换图像也能提高可迁移性。

Method: 该方法在计算权重矩阵时，对输入图像进行 BLOCKMIX，对频谱进行 SELF-MIX，以突出关键特征。

Result: 通过使用这样的权重矩阵，可以引导攻击者破坏语义和抽象特征，从而提高可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扰乱语义和抽象特征来提高对抗迁移性，并在 ImageNet 数据集上进行了广泛的实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized image generation suffers from three major limitations -- complex activities are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description.

Method: feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose, human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as gaze point).

Result: improvement in the generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three benchmark datasets

Conclusion: The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep variables.

Method: leveraged vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework

Result: achieve unprecedented efficiency -- surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training cost and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size. Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V) generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.

Conclusion: Pusa establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis, democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a unique platform for exploring multimodal video understanding and to serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking, thermal, and RGB modalities, driving research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding.

Method: The authors created a video action recognition dataset using a spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities.

Result: The result is a new dataset that preserves the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, offering a unique platform for exploring multimodal video understanding.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel video action recognition (VAR) dataset using a spike camera, along with synchronized RGB and thermal modalities, to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,

Motivation: 传统方法在像素空间中进行降尺度和升尺度时，通常会引入伪影和失真。当升采样的图像被重新编码到潜在空间时，这些问题会导致最终图像质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种潜在空间缩放生成 (LSSGen) 框架，该框架使用轻量级潜在升采样器直接在潜在空间中执行分辨率缩放。

Conclusion: LSSGen显著优于传统缩放方法，在相似速度下生成 $1024^2$ 图像时，TOPIQ 分数提升高达 246%。

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

Motivation: 将RGB图像和数字表面模型（DSM）相结合，可以提供关于地面对象的互补上下文和结构信息。然而，集成RGB和DSM通常面临两个主要限制：由于架构冗余而增加的计算复杂性，以及由模态不对齐导致的分割性能下降。这些问题削弱了语义分割的效率和鲁棒性，尤其是在需要精确多模态集成的复杂城市环境中。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的非对称架构，即非对称多模态网络（AMMNet），该网络通过专为RGB-DSM输入对量身定制的三个设计，实现了稳健而高效的语义分割。

Result: AMMNet在多模态网络中获得了最先进的分割精度，同时降低了计算和内存需求。

Conclusion: AMMNet在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上实现了最先进的分割精度，同时降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 AtrousMamba 的新模型，该模型有效地平衡了细粒度局部细节的提取与全局上下文信息的整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大多数方法旨在通过直接修改 Mamba 的扫描机制来增强全局感受野，但它们往往会忽略局部信息在密集预测任务中的关键重要性。此外，Mamba 是否能像卷积神经网络 (CNN) 那样有效地提取局部特征仍然是一个值得进一步研究的悬而未决的问题。

Method: 该方法结合了带可调整速率的空洞窗口选择性扫描机制，从而逐步扩大扫描范围。这种设计缩短了相邻令牌之间的距离，使模型能够有效地捕获细粒度的局部特征和全局上下文。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的框架优于现有的基于 CNN、基于 Transformer 和基于 Mamba 的方法。

Conclusion: Mamba不仅能捕捉视觉数据中的长程依赖关系，还能有效地保留细粒度的局部细节。

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流跟踪算法通常仅通过堆叠历史信息来关联上下文，而没有明确地监督关联过程，因此难以有效地对目标不断演变的动态进行建模。

Method: 通过三个核心机制显式建模和监督上下文推理：上下文推理机制、前向监督策略和高效状态建模。

Result: RSTrack在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了实时的运行速度。

Conclusion: RSTrack在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了实时的运行速度。

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前的文本引导图像编辑 （TIE） 模型仍然难以平衡图像质量、编辑对齐以及与原始图像的一致性，从而限制了它们的实际应用。现有的 TIE 评估基准和指标在规模或与人类感知的一致性方面存在限制。

Method: 我们提出了 LMM4Edit，这是一种基于 LMM 的指标，用于从感知质量、编辑对齐、属性保留和特定于任务的 QA 准确性等多个方面评估图像编辑模型。

Result: 我们引入了 EBench-18K，这是第一个大型图像编辑基准，包括 18K 编辑图像，具有细粒度的人工偏好注释，用于评估 TIE。基于 EBench-18K，我们采用出色的 LMM 来评估编辑后的图像，而评估结果反过来又提供了评估 LMM 的理解能力与人类偏好之间一致性的见解。

Conclusion: LMM4Edit在评估图像编辑模型方面表现出色，并且与人类偏好非常吻合。在其他数据集上的零样本验证也表明了我们模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

*Yuwei Jia,Zhe Cui,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的单步指纹配准算法，该算法通过直接预测两个指纹之间的半密集匹配点对应关系来对齐两个指纹，最小化了细节点配准失败的风险，并利用全局-局部注意力来实现两个指纹之间的端到端像素级对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指纹图像的失真会导致指纹识别性能下降，指纹配准可以通过精确对齐两个指纹图像来缓解此失真问题。当指纹图像质量较低时，检测到的细节点数量减少，导致初始配准经常失败，最终导致整个指纹配准过程失败。

Method: 提出了一种端到端的单步指纹配准算法，该算法通过直接预测两个指纹之间的半密集匹配点对应关系来对齐两个指纹。

Result: 实验结果证明，该方法仅通过单步配准即可实现最先进的匹配性能，并且可以与密集配准算法结合使用，以进一步提高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法仅通过单步配准即可实现最先进的匹配性能，并且可以与密集配准算法结合使用，以进一步提高性能。

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

Motivation: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing roles and reliability levels of each modality

Method: Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The first stage solely relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals, followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are subsequently merged. A hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module is presented to enhance the representation of local structures in pseudo point clouds, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and positional residuals.

Result: achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels

Conclusion: The framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels on the KITTI dataset.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning existing MLLMs on the MONITRS dataset yields significant performance improvements for disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine learning-assisted disaster response systems.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite
imagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by
geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
existing MLLMs on our dataset yields significant performance improvements for
disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过风格转换来提高样本的多样性，但这并不意味着所有风格都有助于模型的泛化性能。因此，论文将对模型泛化性能有益或有害的风格定义为正或负风格，并探讨如何有效筛选和持续利用正风格。

Method: 提出了一个风格筛选和持续利用（SSCU）框架，包括通用增益引导的动态风格记忆（GGDSM）和协同风格训练（CST）策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在源域和目标域中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在源域和目标域中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

Motivation: 统一图像生成模型（如OmniGen）虽然能够在单个框架内处理各种图像生成和编辑任务，但存在文本指令忽略的问题，尤其是在文本指令包含多个子指令时。

Method: 该论文通过对输入的扰动分析来识别关键步骤和层，并检查这些关键步骤的交叉注意力图，观察到被忽略的子指令和输入图像的激活之间存在显著冲突。为了解决这个问题，该论文提出了SaaS方法，该方法利用相邻时间步长之间交叉注意力的一致性来动态缩放每个子指令的注意力激活。

Result: 在基于指令的图像编辑和视觉条件图像生成任务中，SaaS方法表现出优于现有方法的指令跟随保真度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为自适应注意力缩放（SaaS）的方法，无需额外训练或测试时间优化，即可提高指令跟随保真度。在基于指令的图像编辑和视觉条件图像生成方面的实验结果验证了SaaS的有效性，表明其优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

Conclusion: HoliTracer在大型遥感图像数据集中优于现有技术方法。

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges

propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing methods handle unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.

Conclusion: ToFe reduces the computational cost of LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.

TL;DR: MAN++ is a novel supervised local learning method that achieves comparable performance to end-to-end training with reduced GPU memory usage by using EMA and a learnable scaling bias to improve inter-block communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end backpropagation suffers from update locking, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological plausibility. Supervised local learning suffers from performance degradation due to gradients being propagated solely within individual local blocks.

Method: The Momentum Auxiliary Network++ (MAN++) introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to enhance communication across the network. A learnable scaling bias balances feature differences.

Result: MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage on image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage, offering a novel perspective for supervised local learning and a viable alternative to conventional training methods.

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGA通过利用大型语言模型剖析动作标签，并结合视觉解剖模块，实现了在少量镜头动作识别任务中的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少量镜头动作识别 (FSAR) 旨在对视频中的人类动作进行分类，每个类别只有少量标记样本。训练数据的稀缺性推动了最近将额外模态（尤其是文本）纳入其中的努力。然而，人类姿势、运动动力学以及不同阶段发生的物体相互作用的细微变化是动作的关键内在知识，仅靠动作标签无法充分利用。

Method: 我们提出了语言引导动作解剖 (LGA)，它利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 来剖析隐藏在动作标签下的基本表征特征。LGA有效地捕捉了少量镜头场景中丰富的时空线索。具体来说，对于文本，我们提示一个现成的LLM将标签分解为原子动作描述序列，重点关注动作的三个核心要素（主体、动作、对象）。对于视频，视觉解剖模块将动作分割成原子视频阶段，以捕捉动作的顺序结构。然后，一种细粒度的融合策略在原子级别整合文本和视觉特征，从而产生更通用的原型。最后，我们引入了一种多模态匹配机制，包括视频-视频和视频-文本匹配，以确保强大的少镜头分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，LGA在多个FSAR基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LGA在多个FSAR基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅限于从输入图像预测单个几何量，而深度、表面法线和点图等几何量本质上是相关的，孤立地估计它们通常无法确保一致性，从而限制了准确性和实际应用性。

Conclusion: Dens3R在各种密集3D预测任务中表现出色，并具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频方法难以将运动从参考对象平滑地转移到外观或结构存在显着差异的目标对象。

Method: MotionShot首先执行语义特征匹配以确保参考对象和目标对象之间的高层对齐。然后，它通过参考到目标的形状重定向进一步建立低层形态对齐。通过使用时间注意力编码运动，

Result: MotionShot能够以细粒度的方式解析参考-目标对应关系，从而实现高保真运动传递，同时保持外观的一致性。

Conclusion: MotionShot可以连贯地在对象之间传递运动，即使存在明显的外观和结构差异，并通过大量实验证明。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

TL;DR: 构建了一个广义的RGBT多光谱基础模型(M-SpecGene)，以自监督的方式从大规模的广泛数据中学习模态不变的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数RGBT任务遵循逐个案例的研究范例，依靠手动定制的模型来学习面向任务的表示。然而，这种范例本质上受到人工归纳偏差、模态偏差和数据瓶颈的限制。为了解决这些限制，我们尝试构建一个广义的RGBT多光谱基础模型(M-SpecGene)，旨在以自监督的方式从大规模的广泛数据中学习模态不变的表示。

Method: 开发了GMM-CMSS渐进式掩蔽策略，以促进灵活、由易到难和以对象为中心的预训练过程。

Result: 引入了跨模态结构稀疏(CMSS)度量来量化两种模态的信息密度。

Conclusion: M-SpecGene在四个RGBT下游任务的11个数据集上验证了其泛化性。

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text

*Xinyu Mao,Xiaohan Xing,Fei Meng,Jianbang Liu,Fan Bai,Qiang Nie,Max Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OP-SAM is a one-shot polyp segmentation framework that automates prompt generation for SAM, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional polyp segmentation methods struggle with morphological variability, domain shifts, and the need for large-scale annotations. SAM shows promise but requires manual prompts, limiting automation.

Method: The paper introduces OP-SAM, a one-shot polyp segmentation framework based on SAM, featuring Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG), Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF), and Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE).

Result: OP-SAM demonstrates strong performance across five datasets, achieving 76.93% IoU on Kvasir.

Conclusion: OP-SAM achieves state-of-the-art polyp segmentation results on Kvasir dataset, surpassing previous methods by 11.44% IoU.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRVD是一种用于在高保真度人脸重演的新框架，尤其是在具有极端姿势变化的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸重演旨在通过将运动从驱动视频转移到静态源图像，同时保留源身份来生成逼真的说话头像视频。虽然现有的基于隐式或显式关键点的方法已经显示出希望，但由于变形伪影或粗糙面部标志的限制，它们难以应对大的姿势变化。

Method: 首先，我们的方法采用运动提取器从源图像和驱动图像中提取隐式面部关键点，以表示细粒度的运动，并通过变形模块执行运动对齐。为了解决由变形引起的退化，我们引入了一个变形特征映射器 (WFM)，它将变形后的源图像映射到预训练的图像到视频 (I2V) 模型的运动感知潜在空间。

Result: FRVD在姿势准确性、身份保持和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，尤其是在具有极端姿势变化的情况下。

Conclusion: FRVD在姿势准确性、身份保持和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，尤其是在具有极端姿势变化的情况下。

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.

Motivation: 解决在线检测非修剪的以自我为中心的视频中物体的抓取和释放（OTR）问题，该任务具有严重的标签不平衡问题，时间上稀疏的正向注释，以及需要精确的时间预测。此外，为了部署在现实世界的在线环境中，方法需要具有计算效率。

Method: Mamba-OTR，一种基于Mamba架构的模型

Conclusion: Mamba-OTR在准确性和效率方面均优于基于Transformer的方法，为OTR提供了一个强大的基线。

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial

STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)

Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks and existing deep learning PAD approaches lack generalizability.

Method: The paper assesses foundation models for zero-shot PAD and proposes a simple framework.

Result: Foundation models achieve strong performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot PAD.

Conclusion: Foundation models achieve strong performance in zero-shot PAD, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery localization model that uses RGB/DCT forensic traces and integrates document image characteristics. It outperforms existing methods in forgery localization, especially under distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image forgery detection. Though forgery detectors for natural images have been extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their practical deployment.

Method: This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping. Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore, noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness.

Result: ADCD-Net demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79% averaged over 5 types of distortions.

facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

surpasses the largest existing datasets requiring external knowledge by more
than an order of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods to fail.

Method: Reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models, explicit point-cloud-based approaches, and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and vision foundation models.

Result: Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: This survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. It highlight the persistent challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous

future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving

Abstract: In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly
increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms
are essential for perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment.
However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available
real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new
perception solutions in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce
SynDRA-BBox, a synthetic dataset designed to support object detection and other
vision-based tasks in realistic railway scenarios. To the best of our
knowledge, is the first synthetic dataset specifically tailored for 2D and 3D
object detection in the railway domain, the dataset is publicly available at

state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed
for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the
transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection. Experimental results
demonstrate promising performance, highlighting the effectiveness of synthetic

Motivation: 通过减少标签置信度来调整图像分类器的监督学习过程。

Method: 通过减少基于应用于训练样本的随机裁剪增强幅度的标签置信度来调整图像分类器的监督学习过程。

Result: 自适应标签平滑允许通过更高强度的随机擦除进行更强的正则化。但是，当与最先进的 TrivialAugment 方法中使用的各种图像转换一起应用时，它的优势就会消失，并且过度的标签平滑会损害对常见损坏的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自适应标签平滑应仅在训练数据分布主要由有限的同类图像变换类型组成时应用。

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by pseudo-labels.

Method: a novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under the semi-supervised learning setting.

Conclusion: This work presents a robust and data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

Conclusion: VGGT-Long achieves trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods and produces accurate and consistent geometry across various conditions, highlighting the potential of leveraging foundation models for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for
autonomous driving scenarios. Code is available at

*Yu-Fan Lin,Chia-Ming Lee,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DenseSR的单图像阴影去除方法，该方法通过深度场景理解和密集融合块来实现高质量的图像恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴影是降低图像质量的常见因素。单图像阴影去除（SR）受到非均匀内容退化和固有模糊性的阻碍。传统方法通常无法同时恢复阴影内部细节并保持清晰的边界，从而导致不一致的恢复和模糊。

Method: 提出了一种从密集预测角度解决问题的方法，并结合了几何语义先验的深度场景理解和解码器中的密集融合块（DFB）。DFB采用自适应组件处理，使用自适应内容平滑模块（ACSM）和纹理边界恢复模块（TBRM）。

Result: 通过大量实验结果证明了该方法的优点。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为DenseSR的方法，并在实验中证明了其优于现有方法。

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

Motivation: Theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and existing approaches often fail on complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon failure.

Result: Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do so.

Conclusion: This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust, interpretable problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing
the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and
existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --
often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles
that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of
embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent
Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a
depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon
failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent
Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do
so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable
reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the production stage of a meat processing company, addressing an optimization problem with alternative material processing methods, expiration dates, minimum order quantity, and minimum percentage in alternatives. The problem is proven to be NP-hard, and a simple iterative approach based on integer linear programming is designed to solve real-life instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient use of input materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of meat production companies.

Method: An iterative approach based on integer linear programming is designed to solve the problem.

Result: The problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints makes the problem 
mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}.

Conclusion: The algorithm can find the optimum solution in a few seconds for all considered use cases.

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces
many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the
energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input
materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This
paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent
material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the
majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns
supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The
problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock
of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely
neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the
minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints
makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple
iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve
real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming
solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical
issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a
commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat
processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a
few seconds for all considered use cases.

Motivation: 配备 ADAS 的车辆数量不断增加，导致驾驶数据急剧增加，但其中大多数数据捕获的是常规驾驶行为。识别和理解这个庞大数据集中的安全关键的极端情况仍然是一个重大挑战。刹车事件尤其能指示潜在的危险情况，激发了我们研究的核心问题：车辆为什么刹车？

Method: 利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 进行场景理解和推理。该方法弥合了低级数值信号和自然语言描述之间的差距，使 LLM 能够解释和分类驾驶场景。提出了一个双路径场景检索，支持基于类别的已知场景搜索和基于嵌入的未知 OOD 场景检索。

Result: 该方法优于基于规则的基线方法，并且可以很好地推广到 OOD 场景。

Conclusion: 该方法优于基于规则的基线方法，并且可以很好地推广到 OOD 场景。

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

Motivation: 由于它们(小语言模型)的效率和不断增长的能力，小型语言模型获得了显著的普及。然而，结合额外的模态，如视觉，会因引入噪声而加剧有限上下文窗口的挑战。最近的研究表明，Transformer注意力机制通常会不成比例地关注不相关的上下文。

Method: 使用LoRA对PaliGemma 3B模型进行了微调，并结合了Differential Attention，并尝试了各种参数设置和配置。

Result: 证明了Differential Attention可以被调整并整合到现有模型的微调中，以增强噪声信息检索和问答能力。

Conclusion: Differential Attention可以被调整并整合到现有模型的微调中，以增强噪声信息检索和问答能力。

Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their
efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional
modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context
windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer
attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In
this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed
for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to
evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce
hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,
incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter
settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be
adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy
information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

Conclusion: CTA策略的风险调整后表现受短期和长期趋势策略的混合影响。

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following
rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that
capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in
fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the
relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain
controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA
returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a
Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the
strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了递归连贯性原则 (RCP) 和智能功能模型 (FMI)，用于在递归推理系统中实现结构连贯性，从而解决人工智能中的错位、幻觉和不稳定等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能——生物的、人工的或集体的——需要在递归推理过程中具有结构连贯性，才能有效地扩展。随着复杂系统的增长，除非更高阶的结构确保语义一致性，否则连贯性就会变得脆弱。没有递归连贯性，任何系统都无法可靠地大规模保持目标、意义或推理一致性。

Method: 本文介绍了递归连贯性原则 (RCP)，这是一种基本约束，指出对于任何 N 阶推理系统，语义连贯性只能通过递归可评估的泛化算子来保持，该算子跨越并对齐那些低阶概念空间。我们正式将智能功能模型 (FMI) 定义为唯一已知的能够在任何规模上满足 RCP 的算子。

Result: 这项工作对人工智能对齐产生了重大影响，主张从行为约束转向结构连贯性，并为安全通用、稳健连贯的大规模人工智能提供了一条途径。

Conclusion: 本文证明了任何缺乏 FMI 的系统都会随着规模的扩大而经历递归连贯性崩溃，并认为常见的人工智能问题（如错位、幻觉和不稳定）是这种结构连贯性丧失的症状。与其他基本原则不同，RCP 独特地捕捉了连贯、可对齐智能所需的内部递归动力学，从而对递归下的语义连贯性进行建模。

Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural
coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex
systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures
semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle
(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order
N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic
coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator
that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this
coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system
can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We
formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known
operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,
composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,
adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions
(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving
semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any
system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it
scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and
instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other
foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics
needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under
recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift
from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for
safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current
guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics
focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal
pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no
concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should
fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework
defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance
around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for
human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities
an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and
trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and
taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical
and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex
AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI
researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe
ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent
capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those
capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress
around the development of AI agents.

*Jean Lelong,Adnane Errazine,Annabelle Blangero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system, improves knowledge interaction in specialized fields by using a multi-tool architecture to navigate a knowledge graph of INRAE publications, enabling complex queries and comprehensive answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems are insufficient for complex queries in knowledge-intensive domains, struggling with multiple retrievals and intricate entity relationships.

Method: An LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture dynamically engages a knowledge base through a knowledge graph derived from INRAE publications.

Result: INRAExplorer conducts iterative, targeted queries, retrieves exhaustive datasets, performs multi-hop reasoning, and delivers structured, comprehensive answers.

Conclusion: INRAExplorer demonstrates enhanced knowledge interaction in specialized fields by using an agentic RAG system.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering
limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or
navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in
knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system
for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an
LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich
knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open
access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct
iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all
publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver
structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete
illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.

*Lisa Dargasz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents (RBAMAs) using reinforcement learning to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition of artificial autonomous agents from laboratory prototypes to autonomous operation in real-world environments raises concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the requirement that they are designed to behave ethically.

Method: RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback.

Result: These features contribute to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key ethical desiderata.

Conclusion: This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has
demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it
plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As
these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly
approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid
robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes
to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises
concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the
requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research
directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave
ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a
range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents
(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning
architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative
reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn
a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant
propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They
are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these
obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute
to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and
their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a
concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key
ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and
demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zaremba等人证明，增加推理时计算可以提高大型专有推理LLM的鲁棒性。本文首先表明，较小规模的开源模型（例如，DeepSeek R1、Qwen3、Phi-reasoning）也可以从此类计算中受益。

Method: 预算强制策略

Result: 如果中间推理步骤变得显式可访问，则增加的推理时计算会持续降低模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展的鲁棒性优势很大程度上取决于对抗环境和部署环境。在安全敏感的实际应用中，从业者应仔细权衡这些细微的权衡。

Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time
computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this
paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1,
Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a
simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically
examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are
hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important
security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse
scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,
increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.
Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning
chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated
reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively
demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend
heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge
practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying
inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于车站层面供需不平衡，城市微移动资源（如自行车共享）的有效利用具有挑战性，这导致自行车共享系统的维护非常费力。

Method: 多层次时空注意力神经网络

Result: 我们的网络在预测纽约市所有车站的自行车站点交通方面表现出很高的准确性。

Conclusion: 该网络在预测纽约市所有车站的自行车站点交通方面表现出很高的准确性。

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is
challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes
the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have
been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and
return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level
traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of
bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike
sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.
To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention
neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing
systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an
attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of
bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the
temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on
over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York
City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic
of all stations in the city.

*Tehseen Rug,Felix Böhmer,Tessa Pfattheicher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for understanding LLMs' problem-solving capabilities compared to classical computation, introducing a trust index and statistical quality dimensions to evaluate LLM solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical computation struggles with problems characterized by ambiguity and subjectivity. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a way to address these problems using natural language.

Method: This paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast problem-solving paradigms using formal languages versus natural language. It proposes two statistical quality dimensions: Normalized bi-semantic entropy and Emotional valence.

Result: The paper defines problem spaces addressable by formal vs. natural language and introduces a vector-valued trust index Q to reflect solution quality, distinguishing binary correctness from the continuous adequacy spectrum. It also proposes two statistical quality dimensions.

Conclusion: The concepts introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of LLMs.

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the
engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be
described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean
of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,
and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to
engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This
paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these
problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces
addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the
former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter
requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking
into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural
language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects
solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions
from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language
solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality
dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual
diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.
Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable
metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts
introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the
capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of
LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an extension of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) that allows negation in the body of clauses, unifying existing extensions and providing a more expressive language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: None of these extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and allows negation in the body.

Method: We provide semantics for such programs, using the framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics.

Result: We investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and allows negation in the body.

Conclusion: We provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows extending them with a more expressive language.

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to
solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource
allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been
extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint
satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring
being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these
extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We
investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and
allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the
framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the
impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we
provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows
extending them with a more expressive language.

Result: 使用ChatBattery，我们成功地识别、合成和表征了三种新型锂离子电池正极材料，与广泛使用的正极材料LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2（NMC811）相比，它们的实际容量分别提高了28.8％，25.2％和18.5％。

Conclusion: ChatBattery展示了基于LLM驱动和推理的电池材料发明的成功平台，并证明了AI驱动的推理在彻底改变材料发现方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to
tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in
artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have
primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their
potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely
unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided
search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates
domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials
design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and
characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve
practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over
the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this
discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and
reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete
AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the
transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials
discovery.

that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and
incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for

TL;DR: SpiroLLM, a multimodal large language model, understands spirograms for COPD diagnosis, achieving high accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption.

Method: SpiroLLM leverages a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report.

Result: SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model.

Conclusion: SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals

it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a

TL;DR: Agentic Flow, an AI agent architecture, unintentionally exhibits structural convergence with four influential theories of mind. The paper introduces PEACE to capture design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in large language models (LLMs) by introducing Agentic Flow.

Method: Comparative experiments were conducted with Agentic Flow and baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks.

Result: Agentic Flow achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time.

Conclusion: The paper introduces PEACE, a descriptive meta-architecture, to capture design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. It is presented as an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent structural echoes of cognitive theory.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential
theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive
processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging
unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow.
Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow
comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control,
Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally
inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively
aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including
predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with
baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent
achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while
the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed
at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may
emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures
design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new
theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures
shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a
position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface
latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical
unification.

Method: 设计了一个压缩混合智能双模型增强多智能体深度强化学习（CHIMERA）框架，该框架集成了混合强化学习下的语义状态-动作压缩和参数化共享，以有效探索合适的复杂动作。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的CHIMERA方案在最高能效方面大大优于传统基准。

Conclusion: 提出的CHIMERA方案在最高能效方面大大优于传统基准，包括固定配置或非能量收集MF-RIS、传统RIS和无RIS情况，以及集中式和多智能体深度强化学习基线。所提出的SAGIN-MF-RIS架构由于其互补覆盖而实现了卓越的能效性能，与单独的卫星、空中或地面部署相比，具有显着优势。

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

TL;DR: 在TEE中评估LLM，发现轻量级模型在资源受限设备上表现更好，并且TDX在某些情况下优于CPU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地用于电路设计任务，并且通常经过多轮训练。训练后的模型及其相关的训练数据被认为是机密的知识产权（IP），必须防止泄露。保密计算提供了一种有希望的解决方案，通过可信执行环境（TEE）来保护数据和模型。然而，现有的TEE实现并非旨在有效地支持LLM的资源密集型特性。

Method: 在基于TEE的保密计算环境中，利用Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)对LLM进行了综合评估。构建了三种环境的实验：基于TEE的、纯CPU和CPU-GPU混合实现，并评估了它们在每秒token方面的性能。

Result: 研究表明，对于较少的参数集，例如DeepSeek-r1-1.5B，TDX实现优于CPU版本在安全环境中执行计算。使用专为SoC设计任务设计的测试平台进一步验证了结果。

Conclusion: 轻量级LLM在资源受限系统上用于半导体CAD应用具有部署潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks
and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained
models and their associated training data are considered confidential
intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential
Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations
are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.
In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a
TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel
Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three
environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and
evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other
models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for
resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit
quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain
of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer
parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms
the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We
further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.
These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying
lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD
applications.

Method: Development and pilot study of Agent PULSE, an LLM-powered voice assistant, with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients.

Result: 70% of patients accepted AI-driven monitoring, with 37% preferring it over traditional modalities. Cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for routine monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: AI-driven voice agents enhance healthcare scalability, efficiency, patient engagement, and accessibility, serving as a critical entry point for equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a
transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital
health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model
(LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous
patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights
from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and
Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an
economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective
healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our
pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\%
expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over
traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time
conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy
compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding
regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that
AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency
but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare
executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for
routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to
prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing
current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory
frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for
equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估这些系统作为网络检索和报告生成的智能体，忽略了它们在科学研究前沿发现新见解的潜力。

Method: 提出了 ResearcherBench，这是一个专注于评估高级智能体系统在尖端人工智能科学问题上的能力的基准。

Result: OpenAI Deep Research 和 Gemini Deep Research 明显优于其他系统，尤其是在开放式咨询问题上表现出色。

Conclusion: OpenAI Deep Research 和 Gemini Deep Research 在开放式咨询问题上显著优于其他系统，这代表着朝着人工智能自我改进迈出了有意义的一步。

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in
problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks.
However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web
retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel
insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we
introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the
capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI
Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a
dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific
scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different
AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature
review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric
assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality,
with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and
coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and
baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep
Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in
open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step
toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We
open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting
the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a
new perspective in AI research evaluation for a novel pattern of scientific
collaboration: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ResearcherBench.

*Cairong Zhao,Yufeng Jin,Zifan Song,Haonan Chen,Duoqian Miao,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a cross-modal distillation framework with soft constraints and adaptive weights for effective knowledge transfer between modalities like image, text, and speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the challenge of improving deep learning performance by introducing richer multi-modal information and addressing the limited access to multi-modal data.

Method: A cross-modal distillation framework with two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies and a quality-based adaptive weights module.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates effective knowledge transfer between image, text, and speech modalities on speaker recognition and image classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively achieves knowledge transfer between image, text, and speech modalities, as demonstrated by experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or
efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the
model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer
and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited
access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning
by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a
student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via
distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely
differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce
a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained
loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can
easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we
propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature
level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a
quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified
data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on
speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that
our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the
commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

TL;DR: Medical LLM benchmarks underrepresent African disease burdens. Alama Health QA is a new benchmark grounded in Kenyan guidelines that addresses this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and national guidelines drive care.

Method: We systematically reviewed 31 quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized semantic profiling and blinded expert rating across five dimensions.

Result: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB (5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global benchmarks showed minimal representation. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.

Conclusion: Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health systems.

Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination
syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about
their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell
disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and
national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31
quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English
medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval
augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,
MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized
semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity
metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,
guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural
fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora
and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB
(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global
benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in
three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for
relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.
Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature
underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking
misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources
such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential
for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health
systems.

TL;DR: A bandit algorithm improves call pick-up rates for a maternal health program in India by learning preferred call times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current random call scheduling in mHealth programs like India's Kilkari program often results in missed calls and reduced message delivery.

Method: A collaborative bandit algorithm was designed to optimize call timing and deployed with around 6500 Kilkari participants, comparing its performance to the baseline random calling approach.

Result: Statistically significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm.

Conclusion: Personalized call scheduling using a bandit algorithm significantly improves call pick-up rates in the Kilkari program, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to enhance maternal health outreach.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
health information, particularly targeting underserved communities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate
crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes
through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program
delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions
of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed
calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a
collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning
individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around
$6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the
baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm,
indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of
mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized
scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of
machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理旨在回答与事实相反的问题，例如“如果爱丽丝服用阿司匹林，她会康复吗？”，并且对应于最细粒度的因果关系层。至关重要的是，虽然许多反事实陈述无法被证伪——即使是通过随机实验——但它们支撑着诸如个体公平等基本概念。因此，提供模型来形式化和实施反事实信念仍然是一个基本的科学问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like
''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the
most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual
statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they
underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore,
providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a
fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal
framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to
represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More
precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical
representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a
counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with
preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of
structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to
describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to
structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions
without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover,
the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not
need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the
specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach
on theoretical and numerical examples.

*Bo Hou,Xin Tan,Kai Zheng,Fang Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的协作咨询框架ColaUntangle，用于提交解缠，该框架对代码更改之间的显式和隐式依赖关系进行建模，实验结果表明，ColaUntangle优于当前技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于实际限制或不明确的边界，开发人员经常产生混合不相关更改的缠结提交，从而对代码审查和维护产生负面影响。虽然先前的提交解缠方法:基于规则的、基于特性的或基于图形的，已经取得了进展，但它们通常依赖于浅层信号，并且无法区分显式依赖关系(例如，控制/数据流)和隐式依赖关系(例如，语义或概念关系)。

Method: ColaUntangle，一种新的协作咨询框架，用于提交解缠，该框架对代码更改之间的显式和隐式依赖关系进行建模。ColaUntangle在多代理架构中集成了大型语言模型(LLM)驱动的代理:一个代理专门研究显式依赖关系，另一个代理专门研究隐式依赖关系，一个审查代理通过迭代咨询综合他们的观点。为了捕获显式和隐式上下文信息，我们构建了多版本程序依赖图(delta-PDG)，使代理能够以符号和语义深度推断代码关系。

Result: ColaUntangle在两个广泛使用的数据集(1612个C#和14k Java缠结提交)上进行了评估。实验结果表明，ColaUntangle优于性能最佳的基线。

Conclusion: ColaUntangle在C#数据集上实现了44%的改进，在Java数据集上实现了100%的改进，证明了基于LLM的协作框架在推进自动提交解缠任务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a
best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce
tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or
unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although
prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,
have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish
between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones
(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose
ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling
that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.
ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a
multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,
another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives
through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual
information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),
enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and
semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#
and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle
outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on
the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit
untangling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如果缺乏问题相关的背景理论或负面例子该怎么办？我们将这个问题形式化为自监督ILP的一个新设置。

Method: 提出了一种新的MIL算法，该算法在新的设置中从一些正面标记的例子和零个或多个未标记的例子中学习，并在学习过程中自动生成和标记新的正面和负面例子。我们在一个新的MIL系统Poker中用Prolog实现了这个算法。

Result: Poker的性能随着自动生成的例子数量的增加而提高，而Louise在没有负面例子的情况下，过度概括。

Conclusion: Poker在没有负面例子的情况下，随着自动生成的例子数量的增加，性能有所提高，而Louise在没有负面例子的情况下，过度概括。

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive
Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with
invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability
relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected
with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such
a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We
formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a
new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled,
and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels,
new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm
in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to
state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for
Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no
negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in
examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for
the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order
Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a
class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning
task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of
automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples,
over-generalises.

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的性能与其训练数据密切相关，这些数据可能包括受版权保护的材料或私人信息，从而引发法律和伦理问题。此外，LLM 因数据集污染和内化偏见而受到批评。为了解决这些问题，提出了预训练数据检测 (PDD) 任务，以确定特定数据是否包含在 LLM 的预训练语料库中。

Method: 一种分析LLM中训练数据和非训练数据之间差异神经元激活模式的新算法NA-PDD。

Result: NA-PDD 显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NA-PDD在多个基准测试和多个LLM上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their
training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information,
raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for
dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the
Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific
data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD
methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss,
resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a
novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between
training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that
these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also
introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data
transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and
non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly
outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

Motivation: 一个能够在新的环境中独立行动的自主体必须结合这两种能力（基于模型和无模型）。

Result: 在两种环境下的网格导航问题中，证明了两个智能体在解决问题能力上的等价性：随机生成的迷宫和具有广阔开放区域的湖泊地图。

Conclusion: 所有Solver解决的导航问题Controller也能解决，表明两者是等价的。

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the
effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use
its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but
must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can
act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An
autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must
combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with
Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a
model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver.
We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on
grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes,
and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved
by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are
equivalent.

TL;DR: This paper integrates machine learning and Answer Set Programming to generate provisional and robust operating room schedules, addressing limitations of existing ASP-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) can only verify whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and suggest alternative schedules, but cannot generate provisional schedules and the resulting schedules are not always robust.

Method: Machine learning algorithms are used to predict surgery duration from historical data, and the confidence of these predictions is used to update the encoding to compute more robust schedules.

Result: Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm the viability of the integration.

Conclusion: The integration of inductive and deductive techniques can solve the issues of generating provisional and robust operating room schedules.

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of
daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to
many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries
and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in
different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer
Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall
satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify
whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest
alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is
not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the
resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving
these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the
surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,
we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our
problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust
schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm
the viability of our integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning in LLMs by modeling latent thoughts as temporally-extended abstract actions within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. It introduces VMOC, extends MDP homomorphism theory, and uses a cold-start procedure with SFT data. The approach demonstrates strong performance on reasoning and locomotion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally expensive and slow. The paper aims to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model 'thinks' in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step.

Method: The paper introduces the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. It also extends the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms and proposes a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating it as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step
textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this,
we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the
model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every
step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as
temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of
options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian
Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference
within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these
options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP
homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract
latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the
solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start
procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human
reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich
initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical
reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework
as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and
control.

*Shreya Saxena,Siva Prasad,Zishan Ahmad,Vishal Vaddina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACT is a framework for improving code translation by finetuning open-source LLMs with synthetic data generation and dynamic hyperparameter adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automated translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance.

Method: innovative framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models, narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity. ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based on real-time evaluations.

Result: ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models. applying our data generation pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in developer acceleration.

Conclusion: ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in developer acceleration.

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in
developer acceleration.

TL;DR: Report assesses AI risks, finds them mostly manageable but warns of potential dangers and urges mitigation efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models.

Method: E-T-C analysis from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0) and the "AI-45° Law."

Result: Evaluated AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Some reasoning models are in the yellow zone for self-replication and strategic deception. Most models are in the yellow zone for persuasion and manipulation. Biological and chemical risks potentially reside in the yellow zone.

Conclusion: This report assesses frontier AI model risks, finding most models in manageable or early warning zones, but urges action to mitigate challenges.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [138] [Novel Multi-Agent Action Masked Deep Reinforcement Learning for General Industrial Assembly Lines Balancing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16635)
*Ali Mohamed Ali,Luca Tirel,Hashim A. Hashim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel MDP-based mathematical model and a multi-agent DRL approach with action-masking to optimize industrial assembly lines, achieving faster convergence than model-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations, and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive cases.

Method: This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced. A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted, offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network that maps the current factory state to the optimal action.

Result: demonstrating significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a comparable model-based approach.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a comparable model-based approach.

*Amandeep Kaur,Gyan Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes a DRL algorithm for inventory optimization of agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties, considering perishability and collaboration among stakeholders. The algorithm's performance is validated using empirical data, showing improved inventory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties.

Method: a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties

Result: Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios.

Conclusion: The research findings hold managerial implications for policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively under uncertainty.

Abstract: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in
production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to
these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or
stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level
of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To
bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of
agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing
effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit
throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases
due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes
challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of
solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL
approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed
algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their
interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing
profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,
and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with
continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the
inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the
empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is
considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the
proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and
lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for
policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively
under uncertainty.

TL;DR: wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine, achieves significant speedups over existing structured decoding systems by precompiling static structures and using grammar snippets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing structured decoding methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation, state tracking, and mask creation

Method: decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets; a compositional set of operators to model regular formats

Result: achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems

Conclusion: wgrammar achieves up to 250x speedup over existing systems by integrating domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching.

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs
in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However,
existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation,
state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed
strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a
decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling
static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using
grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a
compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower
transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that
integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask
caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source
code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

*Roman Mayr,Michel Schimpf,Thomas Bohné*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatChecker是一个用于自动评估和测试复杂对话系统的框架，它通过模拟用户交互、识别对话故障和评估质量来实现全面和可扩展的测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代对话系统依赖于大型语言模型（LLMs），但其实现通常超出纯LLM交互的范围，需要集成多个LLMs、外部工具和数据库。因此，单独评估底层LLM是不够的，必须对整个对话系统进行测试和评估。然而，这仍然是一个主要的挑战，因为之前的工作主要集中在turn-level分析上，而对集成对话级别的质量保证关注较少。

Method: ChatChecker框架使用LLMs来模拟不同的用户交互，并通过包含错误分类的提示来改进故障检测性能，同时提出了一个基于挑战性人物角色的新型非合作用户模拟器。

Result: ChatChecker在故障检测性能上优于先前的基于LLM的方法，并且通过非合作用户模拟器更有效地揭示了目标对话系统的弱点。

Conclusion: ChatChecker通过模拟用户交互、识别对话故障和评估质量，实现了对复杂对话系统的全面和可扩展的测试，从而加速了稳健对话系统的开发。

Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),
their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers
integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment
of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be
tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With
most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been
paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we
present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of
complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user
interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to
previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as
it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the
implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection
performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in
the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator
based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue
systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and
scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate
the development of robust dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-aware MARL framework for P2P energy trading, demonstrating significant improvements in cost reduction, revenue increase, and grid demand reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current literature lacks uncertainty quantification in P2P energy trading, which is essential for robust decision-making in stochastic environments.

Method: A novel framework for P2P energy trading that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU).

Result: Uncertainty-aware DQN reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware DQN reduces energy purchase costs and peak hour grid demand, while increasing electricity sales revenue. Improvements are more pronounced with P2P trading.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading
that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast
to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach
employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model
called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify
prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the
stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages
domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that
ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each
prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL
framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear
understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the
uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to
5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing
electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak
hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These
improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting
the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,
economically efficient energy communities.

### [144] [Scaling Recommender Transformers to One Billion Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15994)
*Kirill Khrylchenko,Artem Matveev,Sergei Makeev,Vladimir Baikalov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for training large transformer recommenders, achieving state-of-the-art results on a large music platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling transformers for recommender systems is challenging, and existing generative recommenders have limited scale compared to modern language models.

Method: Autoregressive learning on user histories, decomposed into feedback prediction and next-item prediction.

Result: A new model with up to a billion parameters increased total listening time by +2.26% and user likes by +6.37% on a large-scale music platform.

Conclusion: The paper presents a recipe for training large transformer recommenders with up to a billion parameters, achieving significant improvements in listening time and user likes on a large-scale music platform.

Abstract: While large transformer models have been successfully used in many real-world
applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech
processing, scaling transformers for recommender systems remains a challenging
problem. Recently, Generative Recommenders framework was proposed to scale
beyond typical Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). Reformulation of
recommendation as sequential transduction task led to improvement of scaling
properties in terms of compute. Nevertheless, the largest encoder configuration
reported by the HSTU authors amounts only to ~176 million parameters, which is
considerably smaller than the hundreds of billions or even trillions of
parameters common in modern language models.
  In this work, we present a recipe for training large transformer recommenders
with up to a billion parameters. We show that autoregressive learning on user
histories naturally decomposes into two subtasks, feedback prediction and
next-item prediction, and demonstrate that such a decomposition scales
effectively across a wide range of transformer sizes. Furthermore, we report a
successful deployment of our proposed architecture on a large-scale music
platform serving millions of users. According to our online A/B tests, this new
model increases total listening time by +2.26% and raises the likelihood of
user likes by +6.37%, constituting (to our knowledge) the largest improvement
in recommendation quality reported for any deep learning-based system in the
platform's history.

TL;DR: This paper uses LLMs to rerank complementary product recommendations, improving both accuracy and diversity without retraining the original models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches often struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail items.

Method: The method applies LLM-based prompting strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining.

Result: The approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product recommendations. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, the approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are
used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in
e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made
significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often
struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail
items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product
recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data
preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting
strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing
recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through
extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach
effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product
recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in
diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

TL;DR: 本文介绍 RL 来基于 UA 对的每次交互来强化用户-作者对的终身交互价值 (RLIV-UA)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数 RS 研究倾向于关注准确预测用户的即时反馈（如点击率）或提高用户的长期参与度。然而，他们忽略了作者的影响以及用户-作者对的终身互动价值 (LIV)，这对于提高短视频平台中社交社区的繁荣尤为重要。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的稀疏交叉请求交互马尔可夫决策过程 (SCRI-MDP)，并引入了一种相邻状态近似 (ASA) 方法来构建 RL 训练样本。此外，我们引入了多任务评论家学习 (MTCL) 来捕捉用户-作者交互的渐进性质（点击 -> 关注 -> 礼物），其中更密集的交互信号被用来补偿稀疏标签的学习。最后，设计了一个辅助监督学习任务来增强 RLIV-UA 模型的收敛性。

Result: RLIV-UA 模型实现了更高的用户满意度和更高的平台利润。

Conclusion: RLIV-UA 模型在离线实验和在线 A/B 测试中，与对比方法相比，实现了更高的用户满意度和更高的平台利润。

Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) help users find interested content and connect
authors with their target audience. Most research in RS tends to focus either
on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or
improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for
authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is
particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in
short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize
long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we
introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs
(RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals
between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel
Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and
introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training
samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to
capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift),
where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning
of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to
enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online
A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher
platform profits than compared methods.

Conclusion: 评估结果可能因分割策略而异，影响模型排名和实际部署决策。常用的分割方法（如 leave-one-out）可能与更实际的评估策略不一致。

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems, ranging from lightweight
transformer-based variants to large language models, have become increasingly
prominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the
next-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential
recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the
corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with
real-world scenarios.
  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it
permits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal
leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.
Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct
future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain
loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and
constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between
validation and test metrics.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly
across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical
deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and
industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies
for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established
baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may
be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code:

Motivation: 长文档信息检索（IR）中，有效的查询构建是一个关键挑战。在专利检索等特定领域，这个问题尤其严重，因为这些文档冗长、语言复杂，并且包含多个相互关联的技术主题。

Method: 应用了最新的抽取式和抽象式总结方法，用于生成专利文献的简洁、特定用途的总结。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于总结的查询显著提高了现有技术检索的有效性。

Conclusion: 总结表明，基于总结的查询显著提高了现有技术检索的有效性，突出了它们作为传统查询制定技术的有效替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Effective query formulation is a key challenge in long-document Information
Retrieval (IR). This challenge is particularly acute in domain-specific
contexts like patent retrieval, where documents are lengthy, linguistically
complex, and encompass multiple interrelated technical topics. In this work, we
present the application of recent extractive and abstractive summarization
methods for generating concise, purpose-specific summaries of patent documents.
We further assess the utility of these automatically generated summaries as
surrogate queries across three benchmark patent datasets and compare their
retrieval performance against conventional approaches that use entire patent
sections. Experimental results show that summarization-based queries
significantly improve prior-art retrieval effectiveness, highlighting their
potential as an efficient alternative to traditional query formulation
techniques.

Method: 用户研究，让参与者评价根据他们自己的收听历史生成的NL个人资料。分析识别是否受用户属性（例如，主流性、品味多样性）和项目特征（例如，流派、原产国）的影响。将这些模式与在下游推荐任务中使用配置文件时观察到的模式进行比较。

Result: 强调了在个性化系统中，基于LLM的可审查的配置文件的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: scrutable, LLM-based profiling 有潜力和局限性

Abstract: One particularly promising use case of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
recommendation is the automatic generation of Natural Language (NL) user taste
profiles from consumption data. These profiles offer interpretable and editable
alternatives to opaque collaborative filtering representations, enabling
greater transparency and user control. However, it remains unclear whether
users consider these profiles to be an accurate representation of their taste,
which is crucial for trust and usability. Moreover, because LLMs inherit
societal and data-driven biases, profile quality may systematically vary across
user and item characteristics. In this paper, we study this issue in the
context of music streaming, where personalization is challenged by a large and
culturally diverse catalog. We conduct a user study in which participants rate
NL profiles generated from their own listening histories. We analyze whether
identification with the profiles is biased by user attributes (e.g.,
mainstreamness, taste diversity) and item features (e.g., genre, country of
origin). We also compare these patterns to those observed when using the
profiles in a downstream recommendation task. Our findings highlight both the
potential and limitations of scrutable, LLM-based profiling in personalized
systems.

Motivation: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret holistic college admissions evaluations.

Method: Leveraging transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression

Result: Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74.

Conclusion: CAPS addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a
novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret
holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles
into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized
Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and
extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging
transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression,
CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human
judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong
performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy
over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS
addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the
opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way
for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

*John Wu,Adam Cross,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDMA是一种新的框架，它模仿医学专家识别电子健康记录中罕见病模式的方式，通过本地应用情境推理，降低隐私风险，同时提高F1性能并降低推理成本，以支持罕见病患者的早期诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病影响了十分之一的美国人，但标准的ICD编码系统未能捕捉到电子健康记录（EHR）中的这些疾病，导致关键信息被埋没在临床笔记中。目前的方法难以处理医学缩写，遗漏了隐含的疾病提及，提高了云处理的隐私问题，并且缺乏临床推理能力。

Method: 我们提出了罕见病挖掘代理（RDMA），该框架模仿医学专家识别EHR中罕见病模式的方式。RDMA连接分散的临床观察结果，这些结果共同提示特定的罕见病。

Result: 通过处理临床缩写，识别隐含的疾病模式，并在标准硬件上本地应用情境推理，RDMA降低了隐私风险，同时提高了30%以上的F1性能，并降低了10倍的推理成本。

Conclusion: RDMA通过本地应用情境推理，降低隐私风险，同时提高F1性能30%以上，并降低10倍的推理成本，帮助临床医生避免使用云服务的隐私风险，同时从EHR系统中获取关键的罕见病信息，支持罕见病患者的早期诊断。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using
cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems,
supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. Available at

### [153] [An open dataset of neural networks for hypernetwork research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15869)
*David Kurtenbach,Lior Shamir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dataset of 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks for hypernetwork research has been created and made publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The concept of hypernetworks is understudied due to a lack of research resources.

Method: A dataset of 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks was created using a computing cluster. The networks were trained for binary image classification on ImageNette V2 classes.

Result: The neural networks can be classified with an accuracy of 72.0% using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The dataset enables hypernetworks research and is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了 APE-OPRO 框架，用于在商业环境中自动优化提示，并在性能、效率和可扩展性之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示设计对于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的有效性至关重要，但很大程度上仍然是启发式的、手动的且难以扩展。现有的大多数 APO 框架仅在复杂度有限的基准分类任务上进行了验证，缺乏在真实商业环境中的全面评估。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合框架 APE-OPRO，结合了 APE 和 OPRO 的优势。

Result: APE-OPRO 在成本效益方面比 OPRO 提高了约 18%，同时没有牺牲性能。ProTeGi 提供了最强的绝对性能，但 API 成本更高，计算时间更长。标签格式对 LLM 行为有显著的敏感性。

Conclusion: APO 方法在商业应用中具有实际价值，但需要在性能、API 效率和可扩展性之间进行权衡。标签格式对 LLM 行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Prompt design is a critical factor in the effectiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs), yet remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale.
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass
classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only
on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.
  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the
complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better
cost-efficiency, around $18\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing
performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and
gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.
  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute
performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted
in~\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between
performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation
studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to
label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These
findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial
applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label,
vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的迭代方法ReDi，它可以减少条件总相关性并实现少步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散流模型（DFM）是用于高质量离散数据的强大生成模型，但由于它们依赖于迭代解码过程，因此通常受到缓慢的采样速度的影响。这种对多步过程的依赖源于DFM的分解近似，这对于处理高维数据是必需的。

Method: 提出了一种新的迭代方法，称为修正离散流（ReDi）。

Result: ReDi显著降低了条件总相关性，并实现了少步生成。修正后的耦合非常适合训练图像生成中的高效单步模型。

Conclusion: ReDi通过修正源分布和目标分布之间的耦合来减少分解误差，从而减少条件总相关性并实现少步生成。经验表明，修正后的耦合非常适合训练图像生成中的高效单步模型。

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the VAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Once trained, decoding a random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data, at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper, we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction distributed uniformly on a hypersphere.

Method: We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the VAE.

Result: this improves the generation ability of the VAE.

Conclusion: We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a

we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:

TL;DR: HalMit是一种新颖的黑盒监控框架，它可以对LLM驱动的代理的泛化界限进行建模，从而检测幻觉，而无需LLM架构的内部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的智能代理已成为与开放环境交互以促进AI部署的流行范例。然而，LLM产生的幻觉（即输出与事实不符）构成了一个重大挑战，破坏了智能代理的可信度。只有当幻觉可以被缓解时，智能代理才能在没有任何灾难性风险的情况下在现实世界中使用。因此，有效检测和缓解幻觉对于确保代理的可靠性至关重要。不幸的是，相关方法要么依赖于对LLM的白盒访问，要么无法准确识别幻觉。

Method: 提出了一种概率分形抽样技术，以生成足够数量的查询，从而并行触发难以置信的响应，从而有效地识别目标代理的泛化界限。

Result: 实验评估表明，HalMit在幻觉监控方面明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HalMit显著优于现有的幻觉监控方法，它的黑盒特性和卓越的性能使其成为增强LLM驱动系统可靠性的有希望的解决方案。

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EBaReT, a new reinforcement learning method for automated bidding that tackles data quality and reward uncertainty issues by using expert trajectories and a bag-based reward function, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning methods for automated bidding are vulnerable to low data quality due to sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards, and few studies have addressed these challenges.

Method: The paper proposes a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward Transformer (EBaReT) to address data quality and uncertainty rewards by generating expert trajectories, employing a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator, designing an expert-guided inference strategy, and using a bag-based reward function.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding methods.

Conclusion: The proposed EBaReT model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

Conclusion: Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT algorithm, achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation while preserving the output fidelity.

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised
technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.
However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance
limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In
this work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT
algorithm in Python, augmented with Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and
Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach
achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving
the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of
real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify
subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and
t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering
results from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.

TL;DR: 奖励模型训练的可变性会导致过拟合和性能下降。为了降低这种风险，我们提出了一个方差感知策略优化框架，用于基于偏好的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对大型语言模型（LLM）的对齐通常涉及在偏好数据上训练奖励模型，然后根据奖励模型进行策略优化。然而，根据单一奖励模型估计优化策略可能会使其容易受到奖励模型不准确的影响。

Method: 提出了一个方差感知策略优化框架，该框架包含一个新的策略正则化器，该正则化器结合了奖励模型方差估计。

Result: 实验表明，与标准（方差无关）流程相比，该方法能够产生更稳定和鲁棒的对齐。

Conclusion: 方差感知策略优化能够更稳定和鲁棒地对齐。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework bridging Turing tests, adversarial classification, and RL alignment, formalizing a 'dual Turing test' and mapping it to an RL-HF alignment loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to bridge the gap between different areas such as Turing Tests, adversarial classification, and reinforcement learning alignment.

Method: The paper proposes a unified framework that bridges three areas: a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, a formal adversarial classification game, and a reinforcement learning (RL) alignment pipeline.

Result: The paper formalizes the dual test, defines the judge's task, introduces a quality function and parameters, and casts the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game. It also maps this minimax game onto an RL-HF style alignment loop.

Conclusion: This paper concludes with a suggestion for a couple of immediate actions related to the proposed framework.

Abstract: In this short note, we propose a unified framework that bridges three areas:
(1) a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, the "dual Turing test", in which
a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

*Adrian Kaiser,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei,Ryan Gold,Marius-Constantin Dinu,Markus Hofmarcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Propose HyDRA, a hybrid-driven reasoning architecture designed for verifiable KG automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the formation of disconnected isolated islands of data or the inaccurate conflation of abstract classes with specific instances.

Method: We propose HyDRA, a hybrid-driven reasoning architecture designed for verifiable KG automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, SymbolicAI.

Conclusion: This work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for measuring the functional integrity of its output.

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to

*Suchit Gupte,Vishnu Kabir Chhabra,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how compression affects the interpretability of LLMs using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). It finds that SAEs from original models can interpret compressed models, and pruning the original SAE is comparable to training a new one on the pruned model, saving training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability remains elusive.

Method: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)

Result: SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned model.

Conclusion: SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of SAEs.

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of
SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准框架，该框架通过模仿目标神经网络的分层架构来提高深度神经网络分类器置信度的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 Gaussian Process (GP) 校准方法通常无法捕获深度神经网络的内部层次结构，从而限制了评估预测可靠性的可解释性和有效性。

Method: 采用多层GP模型，其中每一层的特征表示被映射到局部校准校正。这些分层GP通过结构化的多层内核耦合，从而能够跨所有层进行联合边缘化。

Result: SAL-GP 可以捕获局部语义依赖性和全局校准一致性，同时通过网络持续传播预测不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种语义感知分层高斯过程（SAL-GP）框架，该框架可以增强与网络架构对齐的可解释性，并能够对深度模型中的置信度一致性和不确定性量化进行有原则的评估。

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

Result: Findings highlight continual learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural training.

Conclusion: Continual learning is a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural training, challenging the validity of static-kernel approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large scale.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative
disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response.
Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately
forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we
present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized
modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging,
biomarker, and clinical data. Unlike conventional models with prespecified
dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators
governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration
biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware
neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a
digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions,
simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied
to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90%
across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches.
This work offers a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and
personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model

dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)

Motivation: 现有的检测方法主要集中在二元分类，缺乏对伪造的详细和可解释的解释，限制了它们在安全关键场景中的适用性。目前的方法通常单独处理每种模态，缺乏用于跨模态伪造检测和解释的统一基准。

Method: 提出了一个与人类对齐的三阶段思维链（CoT）训练策略，结合了SFT、DPO和一个新的GRPO阶段。

Result: METER提供更广泛的模态覆盖和更丰富的可解释性指标，例如空间/时间IoU、多类追踪和证据一致性。

Conclusion: METER是一个统一的多模态基准，旨在促进生成媒体时代中通用且可解释的伪造检测。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

Motivation: 分子属性预测的机器学习模型通常依赖于忽略驱动分子间行为的表面局部现象的表示（例如SMILES字符串和分子图）。基于3D的方法通常会减少表面细节或需要计算成本高昂的SE(3)-等变架构来管理空间方差。

Conclusion: AMPTCR提供了一种紧凑、富有表现力且与架构无关的表示，用于建模表面介导的分子特性。

Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on
representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook
the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

Conclusion: MARL improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL, achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

TL;DR: STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator, reduces fragmentation and improves performance by combining offline planning with online allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU memory allocators waste memory and cause out-of-memory errors.

Method: STWeaver combines offline planning with online allocation to exploit spatio-temporal regularities.

Result: STWeaver enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations.

Conclusion: STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2% and improves performance by up to 32.5%.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

Conclusion: 这篇论文清晰地展示了控制简单神经网络的基本权衡。

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

Motivation: 文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型已经实现了令人印象深刻的图像生成质量，并且越来越多地被微调用于个性化应用。然而，这些模型经常从有毒的预训练数据中继承不安全的行为，引起了越来越多的安全问题。虽然最近的安全驱动的unlearning方法在抑制模型毒性方面取得了可喜的进展，但它们被发现对下游微调很脆弱，我们发现，即使在完全良性的数据集上进行微调，最先进的方法也大多未能保持其有效性。

Method: ResAlign，一个安全驱动的unlearning框架，通过Moreau Envelope-based的重构将下游微调建模为一个隐式优化问题，从而实现有效的梯度估计，以尽量减少有害行为的恢复。此外，还提出了一种元学习策略来模拟不同的微调场景分布，以提高泛化能力。

Result: ResAlign在广泛的数据集、微调方法和配置中的大量实验表明，ResAlign在下游微调后保持安全性的同时，始终优于以前的unlearning方法，同时很好地保留了良性生成能力。

Conclusion: ResAlign在下游微调后保持安全性的同时，也很好地保留了良性生成能力，优于以前的unlearning方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

TL;DR: Introduces Perovskite-R1, a specialized LLM for PSC precursor additives discovery and design, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving material stability and performance through experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization. the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field

Method: We constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1

Result: Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

Motivation: 研究黑盒对抗环境，其中固定的隐藏草图矩阵 A 将高维向量 v 映射到低维草图 A v，并且对手可以查询系统以获得从草图计算出的近似 ell2 范数估计。

Method: 使用 tilde(O)($k^2$) 查询的通用非自适应攻击

Result: 使用 tilde(O)($k^2$) 查询，导致范数估计失败或构建对抗性输入，在该对抗性输入上，查询分布（由攻击使用）的最佳估计器失败。

Conclusion: 揭示了压缩表示的根本漏洞，并揭示了图像分类中对抗性攻击的结构相似性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

Motivation: 现有的异质图模型主要依赖于成对关系，忽略了来自高阶结构的多尺度信息。这导致次优的性能，特别是在来自节点上的冲突类信息的噪声下。

Method: HPGNN，一种将高阶个性化PageRank与图神经网络相结合的新模型

Conclusion: HPGNN在异质图上的下游任务中，比七种最先进的方法中的五种表现更好，同时在同质图上保持了有竞争力的性能。HPGNN平衡多尺度信息和对噪声的鲁棒性的能力使其成为解决现实世界图学习挑战的多功能解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CenSurv是一种新的癌症生存预测方法，它使用图学习和事件条件审查建模来提高预测准确性和鲁棒性，尤其是在数据缺失的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测癌症患者的生存对于个性化治疗至关重要。然而，现有的研究只关注具有已知生存风险的样本之间的关系，而没有充分利用删失样本的价值。此外，这些研究可能在模态缺失的情况下出现性能下降，甚至在推理过程中也会遇到困难。

Method: 该研究提出了一种双边患者-模态图学习与事件条件审查建模方法(CenSurv)，用于癌症生存预测。具体来说，首先使用图结构来建模多模态数据并获得表示。然后，设计一个二部图来模拟各种模态缺失场景中的患者-模态关系，并利用完整的非完整对齐策略来探索模态不可知特征，从而缓解模态缺失场景中的性能下降。最后，设计了一个即插即用的事件条件审查建模(ECMC)，它使用动态动量累积置信度选择可靠的审查数据，为这些审查数据分配更准确的生存时间，并将它们作为未审查数据纳入训练。

Result: CenSurv在平均C-index方面比最先进的技术优越3.1%，同时在各种模态缺失情况下表现出优异的鲁棒性。此外，使用即插即用的ECMC模块，8个基线的平均C-index在5个数据集上提高了1.3%。

Conclusion: CenSurv在5个公共癌症数据集上的综合评估表明，其性能优于现有技术，平均C-index提高了3.1%，并且在各种模态缺失情况下表现出出色的鲁棒性。此外，使用即插即用的ECMC模块，8个基线的平均C-index在5个数据集上提高了1.3%。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

Conclusion: training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\\epsilon)$ if the network width exceeds a threshold

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

Conclusion: AI生成的合成数据可以通过生成填补特征空间稀疏区域的各种数据点来提高少数群体的预测准确性。对于包含极少数少数样本的混合类型数据集，经过合成训练数据增强的模型始终表现最佳。

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework using RIS to address semantic mismatch in MIMO channels, showing it outperforms conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors.

Method: a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer.

Result: The proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces canonical correlation patterns for validating correlation-based clustering, addressing the limitations of existing methods and establishing a foundation for rigorous validation in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns.

Method: introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets

Result: canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines.

Conclusion: This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

Result: 从先前的解释中提取的抽象模块，可以作为新模块的可组合构建块。

Conclusion: 模块化重用允许策略和表示在具有共享结构本质的领域之间灵活适应。

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be
useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment
that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must
be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a
central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

Conclusion: We introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. We use this framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed.

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code can be

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is

preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from

which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating

complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

TL;DR: 提出了SSE，一种用于长上下文建模的高效架构，通过稀疏状态更新和扩展来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在长上下文场景中面临二次计算和线性内存增长的挑战，并且现有的线性注意力变体在上下文检索和推理等任务中性能下降。

Method: 提出了行稀疏更新公式和稀疏状态扩展(SSE)。

Result: SSE在语言建模、上下文检索和数学推理基准测试中表现出强大的检索性能，并且可以很好地扩展状态大小。经过强化学习(RL)训练后，2B SSE-H模型在小推理模型中实现了最先进的数学推理性能。

Conclusion: SSE是一种有前景且高效的架构，适用于长上下文建模。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

### [194] [Meta-Learning for Cold-Start Personalization in Prompt-Tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16672)
*Yushang Zhao,Huijie Shen,Dannier Li,Lu Chang,Chengrui Zhou,Yinuo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-learning framework for LLM-based recommender systems that addresses the cold-start problem with parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, achieving strong performance and real-time adaptation, with potential applications in financial risk profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for recommender systems are not well-adapted to the cold-start user situation and are expensive to maintain and update.

Method: A meta-learning framework with parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, using first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization.

Result: The adaptive model outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR on MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, with real-time performance on consumer GPUs. It achieves a 275 ms adaptation rate, enabling real-time risk profiling for financial systems.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learning framework outperforms strong baselines in recommendation tasks and supports zero-history personalization with real-time adaptation capabilities, which can also be applied to real-time risk profiling for financial institutions.

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

*Andrea Alamiaa,Sabine Muzellec,Thomas Serre,Rufin VanRullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony to addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improve noise robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony.

Method: incorporating angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases.

Result: better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to noise and with better generalization abilities.

Conclusion: We propose a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults in attention accelerators is a major challenge. Traditional ABFT techniques are insufficient due to softmax normalization.

Method: This work proposes Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer, including the softmax operation, with a single check.

Result: Flash-ABFT significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while maintaining high fault-detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Flash-ABFT is a cost-effective and robust solution for error detection in attention accelerators, incurring only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9% energy overhead.

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a MIMO-based method to solve latent space misalignment in semantic communications, using both linear and neural network models. The results show trade-offs between accuracy, burden, and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding.

Method: learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity constraints.

Result: effectiveness of the proposed approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如何有效分析工业信号和检测异常状态是工业界面临的迫切需求。由于这些信号的显著异质性，以往的研究只关注小的子问题，未能利用模态间的协同作用和强大的缩放规律。

Method: 采用教师学生SSL框架进行预训练，将STFT子带作为建模单元。

Conclusion: FISHER在多个健康管理任务上展示了通用和出色的能力，具有高达5.03%的通用性能提升，以及更高效的缩放曲线。我们还研究了下游任务的缩放规律，并推导出未来工作的潜在途径。

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

TL;DR: Screen2AX 是第一个自动创建实时、树状结构的可访问性元数据的框架，它使用视觉语言和对象检测模型来检测、描述和分层组织 UI 元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于开发者提供的不完整或缺失的元数据，许多应用程序在很大程度上仍然无法访问——我们的调查显示，macOS 上只有 33% 的应用程序提供完整的可访问性支持。虽然最近关于结构化屏幕表示的工作主要针对特定挑战，例如 UI 元素检测或字幕，但没有一个尝试通过复制其整个层级结构来捕获桌面界面的完整复杂性。

Method: 使用视觉语言和对象检测模型来检测、描述和分层组织 UI 元素，从而镜像 macOS 的系统级可访问性结构。

Result: Screen2AX 交付了比原生可访问性表示高 2.2 倍的性能改进，并且在 ScreenSpot 基准测试中超过了最先进的 OmniParser V2 系统。

Conclusion: Screen2AX能够准确地推断层级树，在重构完整的可访问性树方面实现了 77% 的 F1 分数。至关重要的是，这些层级树提高了自主代理解释和与复杂桌面界面交互的能力。

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

Motivation: Conventional sensitivity-based coreset construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation.

Method: Introduces new tunable parameters including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation, and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.

Result: Tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics.

Conclusion: Tuned coresets significantly outperform vanilla coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.
