However, existing solutions either rely on model-centric designs requiring developers to manually select, configure, and maintain models, resulting in high development overhead, or adopt task-centric AutoML approaches with high computational costs and poor DBMS integration. We present MorphingDB, a task-centric AI-native DBMS that automates model storage, selection, and inference within PostgreSQL. To enable flexible, I/O-efficient storage of deep learning models, we first introduce specialized schemas and multi-dimensional tensor data types to support BLOB-based all-in-one and decoupled model storage. Then we design a transfer learning framework for model selection in two phases, which builds a transferability subspace via offline embedding of historical tasks and employs online projection through feature-aware mapping for real-time tasks. To further optimize inference throughput, we propose pre-embedding with vectoring sharing to eliminate redundant computations and DAG-based batch pipelines with cost-aware scheduling to minimize the inference time. Implemented as a PostgreSQL extension with LibTorch, MorphingDB outperforms AI-native DBMSs (EvaDB, Madlib, GaussML) and AutoML platforms (AutoGluon, AutoKeras, AutoSklearn) across nine public datasets, encompassing series, NLP, and image tasks.

This is the extended technical report", "summary": "Indexes are critical for efficient data retrieval and updates in modern databases. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of learned indexes, which model the cumulative distribution function of data to predict search positions and accelerate query processing. While learned indexes substantially outperform traditional structures for point lookups, they often suffer from high tail latency, suboptimal range query performance, and inconsistent effectiveness across diverse workloads. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HIRE, a hybrid in-memory index structure designed to deliver efficient performance consistently. HIRE combines the structural and performance robustness of traditional indexes with the predictive power of model-based prediction to reduce search overhead while maintaining worst-case stability. Specifically, it employs (1) hybrid leaf nodes adaptive to varying data distributions and workloads, (2) model-accelerated internal nodes augmented by log-based updates for efficient updates, (3) a nonblocking, cost-driven recalibration mechanism for dynamic data, and (4) an inter-level optimized bulk-loading algorithm accounting for leaf and internal-node errors. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that HIRE outperforms both state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional structures in range-query throughput, tail latency, and overall stability.

Modern imputation methods not only aim for accurate reconstruction but also differ in how they represent and quantify uncertainty. Yet, the reliability and calibration of these uncertainty estimates remain poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of uncertainty in imputation, comparing representative methods from three major families: statistical (MICE, SoftImpute), distribution alignment (OT-Impute), and deep generative (GAIN, MIWAE, TabCSDI). Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty.

To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings.

In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a \"universally effective\" GEO strategy.

This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fbMIA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5177\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u62b5\u6297\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001VLM\u62b5\u6297\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLIP\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u795e\u7ecfVLM\u7684MIA\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8624%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u5728PaliGemma 2\u548cViT-GPT2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CC3M\u548cNoCaps\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecfVLM\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5177\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark.

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53cc\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u7ee7\u627f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7406\u60f3\u5c5e\u6027\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u7531\u3002"}}

Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.\n  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics.

Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \\r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT.

These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.\n  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.\n  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders.

Quek"], "title": "Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?", "comment": null, "summary": "Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements.

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics.

To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS.

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses.

In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss.

We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space.

Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets.

Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.\n  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.\n  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6846\u67b6RePS\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5f97\u5206\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u542f\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u5fae\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6ODE\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u542f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u62bd\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "RePS\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RePS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines.

The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task.

Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \\textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \\textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \\textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection.

For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration.

Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software.

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO.

Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMARC: Surface Material Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input, using only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image.", "motivation": "Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception.

In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes.

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations.

The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods.

However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables \"Thinking with Long Videos\" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively.

This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.\n  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.\n  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u9009\u62e9\uff08DTS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4token\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8f93\u51fatoken\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165token\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7b80\u5355MLP\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5fae\u8c03RoBERTa\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MLP\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "result": "MLP\u8def\u7531\u5668\u57281,000\u4e2aMMLU\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690.5%\u7684\u8def\u7531\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8eRoBERTa\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0889.5%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.25\u4ebf\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6a21\u677f\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u4e09\u5927LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff08OpenAI GPT-4\u3001Google Gemini\u548cAnthropic Claude\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002Token\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece32.6%\u523033.9%\u4e0d\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u56db\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86KRISP\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7248\u672c\u3002\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684 75%\uff0c\u590d\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u9690\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u8fde\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u5408\u6210 VQA \u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5728 DAQUAR \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u578b VQA \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684 75%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u9690\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57df\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u9632\u6b62 AI \u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u5728\u8be5\u57df\u5185\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u548c AR-VR \u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u79bb\u7ebf\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u786e\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5; 2. \u5728\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5; 3. \u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u6709 10-40% \u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u91ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models.

In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term \"warping\". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions.

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths.

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Code available at https://github.com/DJ-Fear/walrus_steering", "summary": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation.

However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $\u0394$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $\u0394$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $\u0394$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\\%. $\u0394$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf NeRF \u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a \u0394-NeRF\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840 NeRF \u6ce8\u5165\u6bcf\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u53bb\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 NeRF \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u88ab\u91cd\u590d\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u5c06\u6bcf\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840 NeRF \u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b(2) \u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\uff1b(3) \u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8fbe 47%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u5c0f\u7684 20%\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u0394-NeRF \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 30-42%\u3002\u0394-NeRF \u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728 PSNR \u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 43.5% \u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u0394-NeRF \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf NeRF \u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u53bb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3002"}}

We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds.

Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction.

StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending.

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller \u0394 across prompts).

This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias.

Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "L4M\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLM\u548cSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u64c5\u957f\u8868\u9762\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6cd5\u7406\u5b66\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "L4M\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6cd5\u89c4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u4ee5\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u88c1\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cL4M\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5305\u62ecGPT-o4-mini\u3001DeepSeek-V3\u548cClaude 4\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7406\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "L4M\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation.

This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter \u03c3. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision.

Under review", "summary": "Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \\citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\\% on the English test set and 50.7\\% on the Persian test set.

Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition).

Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy).

Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods.

These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u53c9\u6700\u5c0f\u5bf9\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6d8c\u73b0\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\uff1a(i) \u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u8def\uff0889-94% \u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5728 28 \u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u5185\uff09\uff1b(ii) \u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5316\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7535\u8def\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca (iii) \u4e2d\u7b49\u7684\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0824-59% \u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002"}}

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prune4Web\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DOM\u5904\u7406\u4eceLLM\u8bfb\u53d6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684web\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Python\u811a\u672c\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4DOM\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578bDOM\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7c97\u66b4\u5730\u622a\u65adDOM\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "Prune4Web\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684DOM\u5904\u7406\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u5373DOM\u6811\u526a\u679d\u7f16\u7a0b\u3002LLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Python\u8bc4\u5206\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4DOM\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u91ca\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316Planner\u3001Programmatic Filter\u548cGrounder\u3002", "result": "Prune4Web\u5728\u5019\u9009\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8625x\u523050x\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece46.8%\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u523088.28%\u3002", "conclusion": "Prune4Web\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684web\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u6837\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u62bd\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u6837\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u6837\uff0c\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u62bd\u6837\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u6837\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u62bd\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u6700\u81ea\u7136\u7684roll-out\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Single-Reset\uff09\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u592a\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Repeated-Reset\uff09\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ec6\u5fae\u4e4b\u5904\u548c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8bf8\u5982\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u62bd\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval.

KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Chatty-KG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86RAG\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u79c1\u6709\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f6e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edfKGQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u8f6e\u95ee\u7b54\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChatty-KG\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cChatty-KG\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684F1\u548cP@1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Chatty-KG\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u8f6eKGQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC.

Wallace", "Sen Wang"], "title": "Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog.

While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u64c5\u957f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u4e49\u578b\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528 TrackList \u5206\u6790\u7ba1\u9053\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 RefoMed-EN \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9 LLM \u56de\u7b54\u5404\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM \u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f8b\u8bc1\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLM \u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u91ca\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5c11\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u548c\u6280\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u91ca\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u4e49\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9 LLM \u56de\u7b54\u5404\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 TrackList \u5206\u6790\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 RefoMed-EN \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b 6170 \u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u672f\u8bed\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u547d\u540d\u3001\u4f8b\u8bc1\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6216\u91ca\u4e49\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30 LLM \u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "LLM \u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f8b\u8bc1\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f4e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u91ca\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5c11\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u548c\u6280\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u91ca\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u4e49\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9 LLM \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c3e\u90e8\u548c\u6280\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u3002"}}

However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChatDRex\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbf\u95ee\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u548c\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u533b\u751f\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u800c democratizes \u8bbf\u95ee\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u836f\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7701\u65f6\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u5019\u9009\u836f\u7269\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u7b49\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "ChatDRex\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56feNeDRex\u4e4b\u4e0a\u3002ChatDRex\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66KG\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u548c\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u732e\u6316\u6398\u548c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8ba8\u8bba\u6240\u83b7\u5f97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u533b\u751f\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0cChatDRex democratizes \u8bbf\u95ee\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u52a0\u901f\u65b0\u7597\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "ChatDRex\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u65b0\u7597\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ece\u800c democratizes \u8bbf\u95ee\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).", "AI": {"tldr": "V^2-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684prompt\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5c06SAM2\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u5272\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86V^2-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u951a\u70b9Prompt\u751f\u6210\u5668 (V^2-Anchor) \u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9Prompt\u751f\u6210\u5668 (V^2-Visual)\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u9a8c\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5668 (PCCS)\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ego-Exo4D\u3001DAVIS-2017\u548cHANDAL-X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "V^2-SAM\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/AnanthaPadmanaban-KrishnaKumar/semantic-anchors-icl", "summary": "Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit.

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u8f7b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5(GA)\u6f14\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u8f7b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5(GA)\u8fdb\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c(2) \u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u91cd\uff0c(3) \u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e5f\u4f5c\u4e3aGA\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u66ff\u4ee3\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5927\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters.

Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency.

Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($\u0394t\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$\u0394t$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $\u0394t$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($\u0394t = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u9010\u6e10\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5 SpatialBench\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u76f8\u5173\u7684 15 \u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u9ad8\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u9010\u6e10\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5 SpatialBench\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u76f8\u5173\u7684 15 \u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u9ad8\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c42\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u9f13\u52b1\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u4e0b\u91cf\u5316\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6807\u51c6\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5177\u6709\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u56e0\u5b50\u60ac\u5d16\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u503c\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "result": "Cliff \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Cliff \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u8026\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548"}}

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \\pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \\pm 0.113 to 0.993 \\pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \\pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \\pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative.

Verma"], "title": "Orthographic Constraint Satisfaction and Human Difficulty Alignment in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade.

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated.

We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy.

By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600.

Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts.

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u63a2\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6307\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper coins the term \"responsible computational foresight\", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u89c1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u8981\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5851\u9020\u672a\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u89c1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8f85\u52a9\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u800c\u975e\u53d6\u4ee3\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5851\u9020\u5177\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u5408\u9053\u5fb7\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002"}}

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.\n  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.\n  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084.

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSGASA\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027jailbreak\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u6709\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u52a0\u5f3a\u5176\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "SGASA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5408\u6210\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u5357\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSGASA \u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SGASA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u76848-puzzle\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08Zero-Shot\u3001Chain-of-Thought\u3001Algorithm-of-Thought\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u79fb\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b-\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u6210\u529f\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u90fd\u5f88\u957f\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u95f4\u63a5\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u96be\u9898\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a(1)\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c(2)\u5f31\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u62a4\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy.

We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology.

While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8003\u5bdf\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4ee3\u66ff\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings.

However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions.

Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing.

More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory.

Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors.

Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections.

It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time.

To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEFT-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLM\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(llm)\u867d\u7136\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03(PEFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165PEFT-Bench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u56de\u5f52llm\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u572827\u4e2aNLP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c6\u4e2aPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6cd5\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PEFT\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86PEFT\u8f6f\u8bc4\u5206\u60e9\u7f5a(PSCP)\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u572827\u4e2aNLP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c6\u4e2aPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86PEFT-Bench\u7684\u7528\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PEFT-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLM\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86PEFT\u8f6f\u8bc4\u5206\u60e9\u7f5a(PSCP)\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u540c\u6b65\u91cd\u7f6e\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u626d\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u7834\u574f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u70b9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u7f6e\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4e0enaive\u540c\u6b65rollout\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u77edrollout\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u6570\u636e(UTD)\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u91cd\u7f6e\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u626d\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u7834\u574f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u73af\u5883\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u70b9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u540c\u6b65rollout\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf4\u660e\u6027\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u73af\u5883\u6765\u8868\u5f81RL\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e2d\u663e\u7740\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u6b64\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u9519\u91cd\u7f6e\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e0enaive\u540c\u6b65rollout\u76f8\u6bd4\u3002"}}

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Vision Transformers (ViT)\u548c\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6(HE)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u591a\u673a\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46HIPAA\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u7981\u6b62\u76f4\u63a5\u5171\u4eab\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(FL)\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4ea4\u6362\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528ViT CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684768\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e4b\u524d\u4f7f\u7528CKKS\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u5bc6\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u5bc6CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u5bc6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630\u500d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e09\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u975e\u5e38\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb(PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741)\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684cls\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684HE\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5bc6\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u805a\u5408\u8f6e\u6b21\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4f20\u8f93326kb\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u672a\u52a0\u5bc6\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8696.12%\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690.02%\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation.

We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet).

Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency.

Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at \u03b1=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense.

Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution.

Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark.

Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure.

This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u64ad\u8865\u507f\u7f51\u7edc (WavePCNet)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5206\u5272\u89c6\u573a\u5916\u5fae\u5f31\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6b21\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u4ecb\u8d28\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u573a\u5916\u5fae\u5f31\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u7cca\u5bf9\u8c61\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u5e72\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u975e\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5 WavePCNet \u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u76f8\u6ce2\u524d\u590d\u4f20\u64ad\u91cd\u6295\u5f71 (TriWCP) \u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u590d\u632f\u5e45\u4f20\u9012\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u64ad\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u91cf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u9891\u8de8\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u7684\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u8de8\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWavePCNet \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WavePCNet \u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage.

Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.

We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost.

In low bit, our method exceeds by -33.91% in BD-Rate and achieves a BD-PSNR of 1.02 dB from the best existing method demonstrated by the rate-distortion curve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRAVQ-HoloNet\u7684\u901f\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u606f\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u548c\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u606f\u6280\u672f\u5728AR/VR\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901f\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAVQ-HoloNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901f\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728BD-Rate\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5-33.91%\uff0cBD-PSNR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.02 dB\u3002", "conclusion": "RAVQ-HoloNet\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u548c\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops.

This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions.

Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval.

Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5FedAPA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eWi-Fi CSI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684 crowd counting \u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001F1 score\u3001MAE\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u4e8eWi-Fi CSI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FedAPA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\uff08APA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7b49\u539f\u578b\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u539f\u578b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u672c\u5730\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fWi-Fi crowd counting \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cFedAPA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869.65%\uff0cF1 score\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869%\uff0cMAE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e860.29\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8695.94%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedAPA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728 crowd counting \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001F1 score\u3001MAE\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics.

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u8c03\u7b49\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f20\u9012\u5173\u4e8e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08ST\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u6307\u4ee3\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u6027\u522b\u6a21\u7cca\u672f\u8bed\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u6709\u9020\u6210\u6027\u522b\u8bef\u5224\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86ST\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff08en-es/fr/it\uff09\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5206\u914d\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6307\u4ee3\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u6027\u522b\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ILM\uff09\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u590d\u5236\u6765\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7537\u6027\u6d41\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u867d\u7136ILM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u672f\u8bed\u94fe\u63a5\u56de\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u97f3\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1(ST)\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u4e0d\u542b\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u542b\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u636e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u58f0\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u9519\u8bef\u5224\u65ad\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6027\u522b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ST\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9(en-es/fr/it)\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u914d\u6307\u4ee3\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u6027\u522b\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(ILM)\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7537\u6027\u6d41\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(ILM)\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u8bcd\u8bed\u94fe\u63a5\u56de\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbf\u95ee\u9891\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7537\u6027\u6d41\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u8bcd\u8bed\u94fe\u63a5\u56de\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u6027\u522b"}}

This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u80fd\u529b\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002RLVR \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9 RLVR \u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e RLVR \u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 RLVR \u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03 (SFT) \u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (RLHF) \u90fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 KL \u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b89\u5168\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6d88\u9664\u5b89\u5168\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf9 RLVR \u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9 RLVR \u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u67e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "RLVR \u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u80fd\u529b\u6743\u8861\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684 LLM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u578b\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 TMVC \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u9760\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u96c6\u90bb\u5c45\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u805a\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u662f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684 TMVC \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u578b\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u90bb\u5c45\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6d41\u884c\u7684 TMVC \u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u8868\u793a\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps.

However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CameraMaster\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff1a\u6355\u6349\u6444\u5f71\u5e08\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u5934/\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "CameraMaster\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c06\u8c03\u8282\u540e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u654f\u611f\u8bed\u4e49\u73af\u5883\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u9010\u5c42\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "CameraMaster\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u5355\u8c03\u548c\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CameraMaster\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u9970\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u9970\u3002"}}

Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner.

However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning.

However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u5fae\u8c03\uff08BFT\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8be5\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7981\u6b62\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "BFT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u8fd0\u884c\uff1a1. \u5728token\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\uff1b2. \u5728\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u6700\u5c0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u201d\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBFT\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u3002\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97SFT\u9519\u8fc7\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eBFT\u7684LLM\u5728\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86GeneAgent\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5206\u6790agent\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "BFT\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eLLM\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules.

In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u6bcd\u8bed\u8005\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5f88\u96be\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u8bd7\u6b4c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u5f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8bd7\u6b4c\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u521b\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5176\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u800c\u8a00\uff09\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bfb\u8005\u5bf9\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u5ba1\u7f8e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8ba9\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u6bcd\u8bed\u8005\u731c\u6d4b\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8bd7\u6b4c\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u7f8e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002\u4f7f\u7528logistic\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u559c\u7231\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u731c\u6d4b\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u65f6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u5e73\u574745.8%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bd7\u6b4c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u8bd7\u6b4c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002\u5ba1\u7f8e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u5f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8bd7\u6b4c\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u521b\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5176\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bd7\u6b4c\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u5bf9\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u719f\u6089\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6216\u6587\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u50cf\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u8fd9\u6837\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u8bed\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u5730\u521b\u4f5c\u8bd7\u6b4c\u3002\u8bfb\u8005\u5bf9\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u5ba1\u7f8e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\\,J_f(x)\\!\\approx\\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\\sim$20$\\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\\sim$2-3$\\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton.

State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process.

Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments.

While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions.

We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools.

Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns.

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset.

Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties.

Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the \"user-item decoupling\" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques.

However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions.

DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(DLM)\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\u7684\u6807\u51c6DLM\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u8fdb\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faExplore-Then-Exploit (ETE)\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u5757\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027token\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DLM\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u9ad8\u6982\u7387token\u643a\u5e26\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faExplore-Then-Exploit (ETE)\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u5757\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027token\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cd\u5851\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660eETE\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8f6e\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u3002\u89e3\u7801\u8f6e\u6570\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u603b\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff08\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u7b97\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u7279\u5230\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Empirical study of LLM-based verified program synthesis in Lean4 (code, specs, and proofs)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBRIDGE\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728Lean4\u7b49\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u80fd\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "BRIDGE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u9762\u5411\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4f7fLean4\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd11.5\u500d\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862\u500d\u3002\u89c4\u8303\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f7fPython\u7f16\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8617.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u63a8\u8fdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002BRIDGE\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6216RLVR\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically \"sculpts\" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u76ae\u683c\u9a6c\u5229\u7fc1\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u7c98\u571f\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5c06\u53cd\u5c04\u7269\u4f53\u201c\u96d5\u523b\u201d\u6210\u7c98\u571f\u72b6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u4e0b\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u53cd\u5c04\u4ecd\u7136\u662f 3D \u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e BRDF \u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5206\u652f\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c98\u571f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u652f\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u652f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5e76\u7ec6\u5316\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7c98\u571f\u72b6\u56fe\u50cf\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e2d\u6027\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u53cd\u5c04\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u90fd\u6709\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5149\u6cfd\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u5c06\u8f90\u5c04\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5c04\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002"}}

The Branch-and-Bound (B\\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \\ours, a Dynamic \\underline{\\textbf{S}}tratified \\underline{\\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \\underline{\\textbf{MILP}} Branching.

In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness.

This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6b63\u4ece\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u5141\u8bb8\u8ffd\u6eaf\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u5141\u8bb8\u8ffd\u6eaf\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6536\u636e\u8bc1\u660e\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u9632\u6b62\u6fc0\u52b1\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u9501\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u68c0\u67e5\u8ffd\u6eaf\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6536\u636e\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6240\u6709\u6743\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9501\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6536\u636e\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6240\u6709\u6743\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9501\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u613f\u666f\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks.

As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\\% to 16\\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\\% to 21. 25\\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy.

While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity.

Entropy-Guided Adaptive Pruning for Diffusion and Flow Models", "comment": "Project page: https://github.com/changlin31/EntPruner", "summary": "Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance.

Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness.

Project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/CtrlVDiff/", "summary": "We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.\n  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.\n  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6 CtrlVDiff\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565 (HMCS) \u878d\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u6e32\u67d3\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\uff09\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u6307\u5b9a\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u5149\u7167\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u6216\u6750\u8d28\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u7528\u989d\u5916\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e2\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u9898\uff1a\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6ce8\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5728\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u91ca\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 CtrlVDiff\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565 (HMCS) \u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u8def\u7531\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u6e32\u67d3\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 MMVideo\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "CtrlVDiff \u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6 CtrlVDiff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565 (HMCS) \u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCtrlVDiff \u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u3002"}}
