### [1] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，用于检测和减轻NLIDB中的分析漏洞，通过上下文语义映射、Hard-to-Vary原则和优化的LLM驱动提示来帮助用户避免“错误问题”漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用自然语言接口到数据库（NLIDB）的应用系统普及了数据分析。但也带来了一个紧迫的挑战，即帮助那些可能在没有统计分析背景下使用这些系统的用户，制定无偏见的分析问题。尽管大量的研究集中在text-to-SQL生成准确性上，但解决分析问题中的认知偏差仍未得到充分探索。

Method: VeriMinder引入了三个关键创新：(1)一个用于特定分析上下文中偏差的上下文语义映射框架；(2)一个将Hard-to-Vary原则操作化并指导用户进行系统数据分析的分析框架；(3)一个优化的LLM驱动系统，该系统使用涉及多个候选者、批评反馈和自我反思的结构化过程来生成高质量、特定于任务的提示。

Result: 用户测试表明，82.5%的参与者表示对分析质量产生了积极影响。在比较评估中，VeriMinder的得分明显高于其他方法，在分析的具体性、全面性和准确性指标方面至少高出20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder系统通过用户测试，证实了其在提高分析质量方面的优势，尤其是在分析的具体性、全面性和准确性方面，显著优于其他方法。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

### [2] [Factual Inconsistencies in Multilingual Wikipedia Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18406)
*Silvia Cappa,Lingxiao Kong,Pille-Riin Peet,Fanfu Wei,Yuchen Zhou,Jan-Christoph Kalo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了维基百科不同语言版本中表格数据的事实不一致问题，这会影响人工智能系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同语言版本的维基百科独立编写和更新，导致事实不一致，这会影响维基百科和人工智能系统的中立性和可靠性，而人工智能系统通常依赖维基百科作为主要的训练来源。

Method: 我们开发了一种方法来收集、对齐和分析来自维基百科多语言文章的表格，并定义了不一致性的类别。我们使用样本数据集应用各种定量和定性指标来评估多语言对齐。

Result: 我们使用样本数据集应用各种定量和定性指标来评估多语言对齐。

Conclusion: 这项研究深入调查了维基百科结构化内容（特别是表格数据）中的跨语言不一致性，并提出了不一致性的分类。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

### [3] [Shop-R1: Rewarding LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior in Online Shopping via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17842)
*Yimeng Zhang,Tian Wang,Jiri Gesi,Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Jiacheng Lin,Sinong Zhan,Vianne Gao,Ruochen Jiao,Junze Liu,Kun Qian,Yuxin Tang,Ran Xue,Houyu Zhang,Qingjun Cui,Yufan Guo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework, improves LLM reasoning for simulating human behavior in online shopping, achieving a 65% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying supervised fine-tuning to enhance reasoning ability, but the performance remains bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the model used to generate the rationales.

Method: The Shop-R1 framework decomposes the human behavior simulation task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, it leverages internal model signals to guide the reasoning process in a self-supervised manner. For action prediction, it proposes a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling.

Result: Shop-R1 achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Shop-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs for simulating real human behavior in online shopping environments. Experimental results show that Shop-R1 achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [4] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DG-PRM，通过动态奖励和帕累托支配估计，提高了模型在复杂场景中的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型（PRM）主要依赖于启发式方法，难以进行跨领域泛化。LLM-as-judge主要关注反馈结果，忽略了文本中嵌入的有意义的指导。静态和粗粒度的评估标准难以适应复杂的过程监督。

Method: 提出动态和可泛化的过程奖励建模（DG-PRM），它具有奖励树来捕获和存储细粒度的多维奖励标准，并动态选择奖励信号进行逐步奖励评分。采用帕累托支配估计来识别区分性的正负样本对。

Result: DG-PRM在主流基准测试中取得了惊人的性能，通过密集奖励显著提升了跨任务的模型性能。DG-PRM能够很好地适应分布外场景，展示了卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM在主流基准测试中表现出色，通过密集奖励显著提升了跨任务的模型性能，并能很好地适应分布外场景，展示了卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于自动口语评估的有效端到端方法，该方法使用单个 Whisper-small 编码器处理所有四个口语响应，实现了 0.384 的 RMSE，并且只需要 44.8% 的说话者数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为 2025 Speak & Improve Challenge 开发的用于多部分第二语言测试的整体自动口语评估 (ASA) 的高效端到端方法。

Method: 使用单个 Whisper-small 编码器处理所有四个口语响应，通过轻量级聚合器组合所有信息，并预测最终分数。

Result: 该系统实现了 0.384 的均方根误差 (RMSE)，优于基于文本的基线 (0.44)，同时最多使用 168M 参数（约为 Whisper-small 的 70%）。

Conclusion: 该系统在不平衡的类别上表现出改进的性能和强大的数据效率，在仅使用语料库中 44.8% 的说话者进行训练的情况下，仍然达到了 0.383 的 RMSE。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [6] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of AI detection tools to recognize text generated by DeepSeek, a recently published LLM, and finds that some detectors are inconsistent, and humanization is the most effective attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM.

Method: The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more samples.

Result: While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).

Conclusion: QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

*Sohaib Imran,Ihor Kendiukhov,Matthew Broerman,Aditya Thomas,Riccardo Campanella,Rob Lamb,Peter M. Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Larger language models update beliefs more consistently with Bayes' theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether larger language models update their beliefs more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with evidence in-context.

Method: Formulate a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset to measure the BCC. Measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model families, comparing against model parameters, training data, and benchmark scores.

Result: Evidence supports the hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language models assign credences more coherent with Bayes' theorem.

Conclusion: Larger and more capable pre-trained language models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the original TeleChat model with advancements in reasoning and general task performance.

Method: The models use enhanced training strategies, including pre-training, SFT, DPO, continual pretraining with domain-specific datasets, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The new models achieve substantial performance gains with T1 excelling in complex reasoning and TeleChat2.5 prioritizing speed. T1-115B outperforms proprietary models such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The paper introduces TeleChat2, TeleChat2.5, and T1 models, which outperform existing models like o1-mini and GPT-4o. The models and their post-trained versions are publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce the latest series of TeleChat models: \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5}, and \textbf{T1}, offering a significant upgrade over
their predecessor, TeleChat. Despite minimal changes to the model architecture,
the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training
strategies in both pre-training and post-training stages. The series begins
with \textbf{TeleChat2}, which undergoes pretraining on 10 trillion
high-quality and diverse tokens. This is followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to further enhance its
capabilities. \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1} expand the pipeline by
incorporating a continual pretraining phase with domain-specific datasets,
combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code
generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. The \textbf{T1} variant is
designed for complex reasoning, supporting long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models
such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1}, including post-trained versions with 35B
and 115B parameters, to empower developers and researchers with
state-of-the-art language models tailored for diverse applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB 是一种神经键值数据库编辑框架，它通过非线性门控检索模块显式地表示编辑过的事实，从而有效地编辑大型语言模型中的知识，同时保持其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地编辑存储在大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的知识，无需大规模训练即可实现模型更新。然而，这种编辑可能会损害 LLM 的一般能力，甚至导致在扩展到数千次编辑时忘记编辑过的事实。

Method: 将现有的线性 L&E 方法建模为查询键值 (KV) 数据库，然后提出 NeuralDB，这是一种编辑框架，它将编辑过的事实显式地表示为一个配备非线性门控检索模块的神经 KV 数据库。

Result: 在 ZsRE 和 CounterFacts 数据集上进行了涉及编辑 10,000 个事实的综合实验，使用了 GPT2-XL、GPT-J (6B) 和 Llama-3 (8B)。

Conclusion: NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性方面表现出色，并且在六个代表性的文本理解和生成任务中保持了整体性能。即使扩展到 100,000 个事实，NeuralDB 仍然有效。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [11] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS is a novel inference-time steering approach that uses gradient-based attribution to identify influential tokens and construct directional steering vectors, outperforming existing methods in language-only and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time steering methods rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly.

Method: GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale.

Result: GrAInS achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Conclusion: GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: LLM can generate synthetic phrase break annotations to address the challenges of manual annotation and speech-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.

Method: leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing effectiveness across multiple languages

Result: Our findings suggest that LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction

Conclusion: LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the speech domain.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TELEVAL, a new benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese interactive settings, focusing on their ability to understand implicit cues and respond appropriately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models (LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world conversational scenarios

Method: propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings

Conclusion: existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合PEFT方法，该方法优于现有技术，同时减少了计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLM）的规模和内存需求，微调仍然是一个计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合策略，该策略动态地将BOFT的正交稳定性与LoRA-GA的梯度对齐快速收敛相结合。通过计算由梯度范数引导的每层自适应更新，

Result: 在四个基准测试（GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench和HumanEval）上，使用参数范围从7B到405B的模型进行的实证评估表明，该混合方法始终优于单独的PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在各种任务中实现了卓越的收敛效率和泛化，接近完全微调的准确性，同时减少了高达2.1倍的训练时间和50%的内存使用。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Motivation: 原始 GloVe 模型自 2014 年以来已被广泛使用，但语言和世界不断发展，并且 2014 年的模型没有被仔细记录。

Method: 使用 Wikipedia、Gigaword 和 Dolma 的子集训练了两个词嵌入集。

Result: 2024 向量包含新的文化和语言相关的词汇，在类比和相似性等结构性任务上表现相当，并在最近的、时间相关的 NER 数据集上表现出改进的性能。

Conclusion: 2024 GloVe 模型在词汇和时间相关的 NER 数据集上表现出改进。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一种新型的口语语言模型，具有副语言和说话人特征意识，旨在将口语语言建模扩展到文本语义之外。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数模型仅仅将语音视为语言内容的载体，通常忽略了人类语音中丰富的副语言和说话人特征线索，如方言、年龄、情感和非语音发声。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Motivation: 现有的评估主要集中在纯文本推理输出上，而 MLLM 通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力在很大程度上未被探索。这项工作朝着解决这一差距迈出了第一步，通过评估 MLLM 在多模态数学推理中基于代码的能力。

Method: 该框架侧重于两个关键评估方面：(1) 多模态代码生成 (MCG) 评估模型从头开始准确理解和构建可视化的能力。(2) 多模态代码编辑 (MCE) 评估模型进行细粒度操作的能力，包括三种类型：删除、修改和注释。

Result: 实验评估涉及九个主流 MLLM，结果表明现有模型在执行细粒度视觉操作方面仍然落后于人类水平。

Conclusion: 现有模型在执行细粒度视觉操作方面仍然落后于人类水平。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates LLMs in HIV management using a new benchmark, HIVMedQA, and finds that while some models like Gemini 2.5 Pro show promise, challenges remain in reasoning, comprehension, and bias, necessitating further development for safe clinical integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating LLMs into HIV clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance, while AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce.

Method: The study introduces HIVMedQA, a benchmark dataset, and evaluates seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs using prompt engineering and an evaluation framework incorporating lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models, but performance declined with question complexity. Medically fine-tuned models didn't always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size wasn't a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases were observed.

Conclusion: This study highlights the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care, as current LLMs have limitations in reasoning, comprehension, and bias, despite the promising performance of models like Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sticky tokens in text embedding models can undermine reliability, leading to performance drops. The paper introduces a detection method and analyzes the characteristics and impact of these tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based text embedding models are widely used in NLP tasks, but 'sticky tokens' can compromise the reliability of embeddings.

Method: The paper introduces Sticky Token Detector (STD), an efficient detection method based on sentence and token filtering, to systematically investigate anomalous tokens.

Result: The study discovers 868 sticky tokens across 40 checkpoints in 14 model families, often originating from special or unused vocabulary entries and fragmented subwords. Sticky tokens can cause performance drops of up to 50% in downstream tasks and disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improved tokenization strategies and model designs to reduce the impact of sticky tokens in future text embedding applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 可以通过利用选项位置或标签中的固有偏差在多项选择题任务中获得虚高的分数，而不是表现出真正的理解。

Method: 引入了一种评估框架 SCOPE，旨在衡量和减轻数据集中这种选择偏差。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE 在稳定性能改进方面始终优于现有的去偏方法，并且在正确的选项上显示出更清晰的置信度分布。

Conclusion: 该框架为提高 LLM 评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新的标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Motivation: Organizations use business process modeling to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and alignment with strategic goals. The challenge is integrating knowledge management activities (ISO30401) with existing operational processes, especially for ISO 9001 compliant organizations.

Method: The authors draw on their experience as ISO30401 implementers.

Result: The article explains how knowledge development, transformation, and conveyance activities depicted in ISO30401 integrate with existing operational processes.

Conclusion: This article explores how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS) entwines with other processes, particularly through the SECI model and PDCA cycles.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel defense method called Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP) to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs

Method: Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP)

Result: GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents

Conclusion: GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning使LLM更容易相信用户提供的错误信息，我们需要小心！


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuning提高了LLM的可用性，但也可能增加模型对用户输入的依赖，导致接受错误信息和产生幻觉。

Method: 通过对比instruction-tuned LLM和base model，分析instruction-tuning对LLM接受错误信息的影响，并探讨了用户角色、错误信息长度和系统提示中的警告等因素。

Result: Instruction-tuned LLM更容易接受用户提供的错误信息，并且instruction-tuning将LLM的易受影响性从助手角色转移到用户角色。

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning使LLM更容易接受用户提供的错误信息，需要系统性方法来减轻其负面影响。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 移除任何层都会导致隐藏状态的显着幅度差距，从而导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp，这是一种新颖的即插即用层修剪方案，该方案利用幅度补偿来缓解训练中隐藏状态的显着幅度差距。

Result: 当与迭代修剪和补偿循环集成时，Prune&Comp持续增强现有的层修剪指标。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp通过迭代修剪和补偿循环，持续增强现有的层修剪指标。例如，当使用流行的块影响指标修剪LLaMA-3-8B的5层时，Prune&Comp几乎使困惑度减半，并保留了原始模型93.19％的问答性能，比基线高出4.01％。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了六种OCR引擎在僧伽罗语和泰米尔语上的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对英语和其他高资源语言（HRL）的大量研究，解决拉丁语及其衍生文字的印刷文本的光学字符识别（OCR）问题现在可以被认为是已解决的。然而，对于使用独特文字的低资源语言（LRL），这仍然是一个开放的问题。

Method: 对六种不同的OCR引擎在两种低资源语言（LRL）：僧伽罗语和泰米尔语上进行了零样本性能的比较分析。使用了五种测量技术来评估字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在所有指标上为僧伽罗语提供了最佳性能，单词错误率（WER）为2.61%。相反，Document AI在泰米尔语的所有指标上表现出色，字符错误率（CER）非常低，为0.78%。此外，还介绍了一种新的合成泰米尔语OCR基准数据集。

Conclusion: Surya在所有指标上为僧伽罗语提供了最佳性能，单词错误率（WER）为2.61%。相反，Document AI在泰米尔语的所有指标上表现出色，字符错误率（CER）非常低，为0.78%。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM 是一种使用 LoRA 适配器将文体特征转移到指令遵循模型的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将 LLM 调整为特定的文体特征对于企业沟通至关重要，但从缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库中实现这一目标具有挑战性，而且不会影响指令的遵守。

Method: 使用低秩适应 (LoRA) 将文体特征有效地转移到指令遵循模型。

Result: 跨多个数据集和模型的实验表明，在保持指令遵守的同时，文体一致性得到了提高，人工评估证实了特定于品牌的惯例。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM 提供了一种在 LLM 中进行文体个性化的有效途径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型推理模型 (LRM) 的新型可调后门攻击，该攻击通过数据投毒方法，在不影响正确性的前提下，可控地增加推理过程的长度，从而消耗更多资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型 (LRM) 已成为人工智能领域的一项重大进步，代表了旨在处理复杂推理任务的一类特殊的大型语言模型 (LLM)。LRM 的决定性特征在于其广泛的思维链 (CoT) 推理能力。在本文中，我们确定了一种以前未探索的针对 LRM 的攻击向量，我们称之为“过度思考后门”。

Method: 通过一种新颖的数据投毒方法实现，该方法将可调触发器（重复次数表示所需强度）与相应冗长的CoT响应配对。这些响应通过指示教师LLM将受控数量的冗余细化步骤注入到正确的推理过程中来以编程方式生成。

Result: 我们的方法可以可靠地触发可控的、多倍增加的推理过程长度，而不会降低最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够可靠地触发可控的、多倍增加的推理过程长度，而不会降低最终答案的正确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.

*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译模型在处理性别不明确的词汇时存在偏差，并且即使在高翻译准确率的情况下，也未必能在模糊实例中表现出不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 源语句包含性别不明确的词素，但目标语言的等价词需要指定性别时，模型必须从上下文和/或外部知识中推断出适当的性别。研究表明，机器翻译模型表现出偏差行为，即使与上下文信息冲突，也依赖于刻板印象。

Method: 使用最近提出的语义不确定性指标

Result: 在高翻译和性别准确率的情况下，模型不一定在模糊的实例中表现出预期水平的不确定性。同样，去偏见对模糊和非模糊翻译实例有独立的影响。

Conclusion: MT模型在处理性别不明确的词汇时，即使在高翻译和性别准确率的情况下，也未必能在模糊实例中表现出预期的不确定性。去偏见对模糊和非模糊翻译实例有独立的影响。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TDR的框架，用于改进ICL中的示例检索，通过解耦任务和利用LLM反馈来实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的有效性在很大程度上依赖于这些示例的质量，而之前的工作主要集中在增强示例检索能力上，并取得了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，在检索高质量示例方面仍然存在两个挑战：(1)难以区分跨任务数据分布，(2)难以在检索器输出和来自LLM的反馈之间建立细粒度的连接。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为TDR的新框架。TDR将来自不同任务的ICL示例解耦，这使得检索模块能够在多任务数据集中检索特定于目标任务的示例。此外，TDR对来自LLM的细粒度反馈进行建模，以监督和指导检索模块的训练，这有助于检索高质量的示例。

Result: 我们在一套30个NLP任务上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明TDR在所有数据集上持续改进了结果，并实现了最先进的性能。同时，我们的方法是一种即插即用的方法，可以很容易地与各种LLM结合，以提高ICL的示例检索能力。

Conclusion: TDR在所有数据集上持续改进结果，并实现了最先进的性能。同时，我们的方法是一种即插即用的方法，可以很容易地与各种LLM结合，以提高ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于任务复杂性和高质量标记数据的限制，社交媒体上的宣传检测仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 结合人类专业知识与大型语言模型（LLM）辅助，以提高注释一致性和可扩展性。我们提出了一个分层分类法，将 14 种细粒度的宣传技术组织成三个更广泛的类别，进行了一项人类注释研究，并实施了一个 LLM 辅助的预注释管道。

Result:  вторичном исследовании проверки человеком наблюдаются значительные улучшения как в согласованности, так и в эффективности использования времени. 我们在协议和时间效率方面都取得了显着改进。

Conclusion: 我们通过利用高质量的LLM生成数据训练SLM，从而开发了可扩展且稳健的宣传检测系统，并支持透明和负责任的媒体生态系统。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: CLEAR: An interactive tool for in-depth LLM error analysis, moving beyond simple scores to identify specific issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation paradigms yield a single score or ranking, obscuring the specific, actionable reasons behind a model's performance.

Method: The CLEAR package generates per-instance textual feedback, creates system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. An interactive dashboard is provided for error analysis.

Result: Demonstration of CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Conclusion: CLEAR is introduced as an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis, offering a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, interactive filters, and drill-down capabilities.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinDPO是一种新的金融专用LLM框架，它优于现有模型，并能通过将情感分析整合到投资组合策略中来保持积极的回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融相关文本数据中表达的观点对交易决策和市场波动产生越来越深刻的影响。监督微调（SFT）大型语言模型（LLM）已成为金融情感分析的事实标准。然而，SFT范式可能导致训练数据的记忆，并且常常无法推广到未见过的样本。

Method: 该论文介绍了FinDPO，这是第一个基于通过直接偏好优化（DPO）进行后训练人类偏好对齐的金融专用LLM框架。

Result: FinDPO能够保持每年67%的大量正回报，并且具有强大的风险调整后表现，如Sharpe比率为2.0所示，即使在5个基点（bps）的实际交易成本下也是如此。

Conclusion: FinDPO在标准情感分类基准测试中表现出色，平均优于现有监督微调模型11%。它通过“logit-to-score”转换将离散情感预测转化为连续、可排序的情感分数，从而实现积极的回报和强大的风险调整表现。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解释结构化数据（尤其是在表格格式中）方面的性能仍然有限。阿拉伯语表格数据的基准测试不足。

Method: 构建了一个混合流程，其中初始内容由 LLM 生成，随后由人工专家过滤和验证，以确保高质量的数据集。

Result: AraTable 的初步分析表明，虽然 LLM 在简单的表格任务（如直接问答）上表现良好，但在需要更深入的推理和事实核查的任务中，仍然面临重大的认知挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs 在处理复杂的表格推理任务时仍面临认知挑战，未来有很大的改进空间。同时，研究提出了一个全自动评估框架，其性能与人工评估几乎相同。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

TL;DR: This paper reviews the generation of synthetic medical free-text, focusing on purpose, techniques (especially GPTs), and evaluation methods. It finds synthetic text useful for augmentation but highlights privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i) the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation methods.

Method: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones.

Result: A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text, especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic medical text.

Conclusion: Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of data transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在通过建模文本化的特征-值对来生成表格数据方面显示出强大的潜力。然而，表格数据本质上表现出稀疏的特征级依赖性，其中许多特征交互在结构上是微不足道的。这造成了一种根本性的不匹配，因为LLM的自我注意机制不可避免地将注意力分散在所有对上，从而降低了对关键关系的关注，尤其是在具有复杂依赖关系或语义模糊特征的数据集中。

Method: GraDe（图引导依赖学习），一种将稀疏依赖图显式集成到LLM的注意力机制中的新方法。GraDe采用轻量级动态图学习模块，该模块由外部提取的功能依赖性引导，从而优先考虑关键特征交互，同时抑制不相关的特征交互。

Result: GraDe在复杂数据集上优于现有的基于LLM的方法高达12%，同时在合成数据质量方面与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: GraDe在复杂数据集上优于现有的基于LLM的方法，并且在合成数据质量方面与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力的结果。该方法具有最小的侵入性但有效，为使用LLM的结构感知表格数据建模提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

the complexity of biomedical terminology and inconsistencies in annotation
across datasets. This paper introduces SRU-NER (Slot-based Recurrent Unit NER),
a novel approach designed to handle nested named entities while integrating
multiple datasets through an effective multi-task learning strategy. SRU-NER
mitigates annotation gaps by dynamically adjusting loss computation to avoid
penalizing predictions of entity types absent in a given dataset. Through
extensive experiments, including a cross-corpus evaluation and human assessment
of the model's predictions, SRU-NER achieves competitive performance in
biomedical and general-domain NER tasks, while improving cross-domain
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态机器翻译方法在利用模态差距方面面临挑战，因为它们强制执行严格的视觉-语言对齐，同时被限制在训练的多模态领域内进行推断。

Method: 构建新型多模态场景图，并引入GIIFT框架，该框架使用跨模态图注意力网络适配器。

Conclusion: GIIFT在没有图像的情况下也能超越现有方法，并在WMT基准测试中显著优于无图像翻译基线。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel hybrid tokenization strategy is proposed to enhance the performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles.

Method: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600).

Result: The model achieved prediction accuracies of 10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error context accumulation

Method: a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs. WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement.

Result: on the GSM8K math benchmark, it accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.

Conclusion: WINO is shown to decisively improve the quality-speed trade-off.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel

TL;DR: AQuilt is a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for specialized domains that achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 at a fraction of the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often underperform in specialized domains, and existing data synthesis methods incur high costs or have performance limitations and insufficient generalization.

Method: AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for specialized domains from unlabeled data, incorporating Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type.

Result: AQuilt constructs a dataset of 703k examples and achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. The generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AQuilt achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 with only 17% of the production cost and generates data with higher relevance to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

*Andreea Nica,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Saibo Geng,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈纳入训练，统一了prompt优化方法，在数学数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示优化可以提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理能力，而无需更新目标模型的参数。该领域主要沿着两个方向发展：一种方法使用文本反馈从通用 LLM 中获取改进的提示，而无需训练；另一种研究则依赖于数值奖励来训练一个特殊的提示模型，该模型专门为目标模型提供最佳提示。

Method: 引入Textual Reward Prompt框架 (TRPrompt)

Result: 该框架不需要事先收集数据集，并且可以通过对生成的提示的反馈进行迭代改进。当与 LLM 内部化“好的”提示概念的能力相结合时，文本奖励提供的高分辨率信号允许我们训练一个提示模型，从而为 GSMHard 和 MATH 等具有挑战性的数学数据集中的问题生成最先进的query-specific prompt。

Conclusion: TRPrompt框架可以直接将文本反馈融入到prompt模型的训练中，可以训练出一个prompt模型，从而为GSMHard和MATH等具有挑战性的数学数据集中的问题生成最先进的query-specific prompt。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions. Using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction following.

Method: Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF)

Result: RLCF is the only method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a 3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: RLCF is the only method to improve performance on every benchmark

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视并重振用于高质量图像生成及其他领域的自回归范式。与依赖预训练组件或混合架构的现有方法不同，Lumina-mGPT 2.0 完全从头开始训练，从而实现不受限制的架构设计和许可自由。

Method: 从头开始训练一个独立的、仅解码器的自回归模型，并结合高效的解码策略，如推理时缩放和推测雅可比采样。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试中，Lumina-mGPT 2.0 不仅与基于扩散的模型相匹配，而且在某些情况下超过了它们。在 Graph200K 基准测试中证实了其多任务能力，Lumina-mGPT 2.0 本身表现非常出色。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一种强大的、灵活的基础模型，适用于统一的多模态生成。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B 是一种轻量级模型，用于生成技术细节丰富且分析深入的运动描述，优于 GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，自动运动视频分析受到计算密集型模型的限制，这些模型需要服务器端处理，并且缺乏对运动动作的细粒度理解。当前的方法难以捕捉对有意义的运动分析至关重要的细微生物力学转换，经常错过准备、执行和完成等关键阶段，这些阶段在几秒钟内发生。

Method: 一种轻量级的 3.3B 参数视频理解模型，结合了新颖的时间运动差异采样和自监督学习，用于高效的设备端部署。它采用基于 DWT-VGG16-LDA 的关键帧提取机制，然后是一个通过掩码降噪目标预训练的 V-DWT-JEPA2 编码器和一个为运动动作描述生成而微调的 LLM 解码器。

Result: SV3.3B 在 NSVA 篮球数据集的一个子集上进行了评估，在传统文本生成指标和特定于运动的评估标准方面都取得了优异的性能，优于更大的闭源模型（包括 GPT-4o 变体），同时保持了显著更低的计算要求。

Conclusion: SV3.3B 在运动描述生成方面表现出色，在地面实况验证指标上比 GPT-4o 提高了 29.2%，并在信息密度、动作复杂度和测量精度方面有显著提高。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Motivation: 文本到图像 (T2I) 生成的最新进展已经产生了令人印象深刻的视觉效果。然而，这些模型在处理复杂的提示时仍然面临重大挑战，特别是那些涉及具有不同属性的多个主体的提示。

Method: 我们提出了 Detail++，这是一个免训练框架，它引入了一种新颖的渐进式细节注入 (PDI) 策略。

Result: 在 T2I-CompBench 和一个新建的风格组合基准上的大量实验表明，Detail++ 显著优于现有方法，特别是在涉及多个对象和复杂的风格条件的情况下。

Conclusion: Detail++ 在处理多个对象和复杂的风格条件方面，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine

great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture for image restoration that uses dilated neighborhood attention and a channel-aware module to balance global context and local precision, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research focus. Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for high-quality image restoration.

Method: We introduce a channel-aware module that complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for image restoration.

Result: achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks

Conclusion: The proposed DiNAT-IR achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module to improve segmentation accuracy in Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) by refining features and balancing local and global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation errors.

Method: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module, which refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits and integrates high-frequency components.

Result: The approach improves existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia-->Cityscapes.

Conclusion: The proposed Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module improves segmentation accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on UDA-SS tasks.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

TL;DR: OPEN是一个用于支持AI驱动的参与度识别的新型数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在虚拟学习中，参与对于参与者的满意度、表现和依从性至关重要，尤其是在在线教育和虚拟康复中，互动交流起着关键作用。然而，准确衡量虚拟群体环境中的参与度仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 收集自11名老年人，他们参加了为期六周的每周虚拟小组学习课程，作为心脏康复的一部分，产生了超过35小时的数据，使其成为同类数据集中最大的。

Result: 多个机器学习和深度学习模型进行了训练，实现了高达81%的参与度识别准确率。

Conclusion: OPEN提供了一个可扩展的基础，用于对老年人群进行个性化参与度建模，并有助于更广泛的参与度识别研究。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

TL;DR: Automated system using YOLOv8s for real-time monitoring of bearded dragon behavior, specifically basking and hunting, with basking detection proving reliable but hunting detection needing improvement due to weak cricket detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting.

Method: We trained five YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of 1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific behaviours.

Result: Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).

Conclusion: This automated system offers a scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments, significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Method: 提出了一个新颖的三流架构TCC-VPReID，旨在解决跨平台和跨模态Re-ID的联合挑战，通过风格稳健的特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适应和中间引导的时间建模来弥合空中地面视角和RGB-IR模态之间的域差距。

Conclusion: TCC-VPReID框架在多个评估协议中实现了显著的性能提升，表明AG-VPReID.VIR数据集具有与现有数据集不同的挑战。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像数据集中影响特定子群的系统性错误标记（即标签偏差）是医学 AI 系统公平性方面一个未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 使用 EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED) 训练深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类，其中标签偏差影响可分离的子群（基于影像制造商）或不可分离的“伪子群”。

Result: 模拟的子群标签偏差导致模型学习到的特征表示发生显著变化。当验证集具有干净的标签时，多数可分离子群的真正率从 0.898 下降到 0.518（当验证集具有偏差标签时）。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，标签偏差对模型学习到的特征表示产生显著影响，并且这种影响取决于受标签偏差影响的子群的大小和可分离性。使用带有干净标签的验证集定义分类阈值可以显著改善子群的性能。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法只能测量邻近性，而不能将距离作为刚体变换的显式函数来产生，因此，流形上的可优化距离函数仍未开发，从而阻碍了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 推导了一个关于刚体变换的两个 Grassmannian 特征之间的可优化成本函数。

Result: 证明了高维线性子空间的基可以作为成本的显式表示。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有解决方案，并在各种计算机视觉任务中改进了现有解决方案的收敛性。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练数据集和三个不同的微调数据集上显著优于Baseline CoCa。预训练的对比损失提高了27.25%，困惑度提高了3.71%，CoCa损失提高了7.15%。平均微调的对比损失提高了13.66%，困惑度提高了5.18%，CoCa损失提高了5.55%。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构提高了视觉语言领域的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Motivation: Existing DeepFake datasets lack forgery diversity, making them insufficient for developing generalizable detection methods.

Result: The paper highlights the limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of the new dataset.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Celeb-DF++, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake benchmark for generalizable forensics, and evaluates 24 recent detection methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Result: ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Generalization F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32%, robustness recall increases 11.1%, and performance degradation is limited to less than 4% under targeted attacks.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new standard for detecting deepfakes using detailed visual and textual analysis, ensuring media authenticity and information integrity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset TAV to improve the coherence of AI-generated videos with multiple scenes. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions.

Method: introduce the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions. Then, post-training the model on the TAV dataset.

Result: TAV dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: post-training on the TAV dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in complex lighting conditions.

Result: This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light conditions.

Conclusion: VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS is a novel adaptation of SAM for automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS using text prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The segmentation of pancreatic tumors in EUS is challenging due to speckle noise, low contrast, and the need for large, expert-curated datasets for fully supervised DL models.

Method: The paper introduces TextSAM-EUS, a text-driven adaptation of SAM that uses text prompt learning (context optimization) through BiomedCLIP and LoRA-based adaptation.

Result: TextSAM-EUS achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, and 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD with manual prompts, outperforming existing SOTA supervised DL models and foundation models.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS provides an efficient and robust option for automatic EUS segmentation by incorporating prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HDF显著提高了识别准确率和鲁棒性，在各种不平衡场景中保持了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and

further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algonauts 2025挑战赛呼吁社区开发编码模型，以预测对自然多模态电影的整个大脑fMRI反应。

Method: 我们提出了一个序列到序列的Transformer，它可以从视觉、听觉和语言输入中自动回归地预测fMRI活动。我们使用包括VideoMAE、HuBERT、Qwen和BridgeTower在内的预训练模型提取刺激特征。解码器通过双重交叉注意机制整合来自先前大脑状态、当前刺激和情节级别摘要的信息，该机制关注从刺激中提取的感知信息以及由叙事内容的高级摘要提供的叙事信息。

Conclusion: 该模型在同分布和异分布数据上都表现出色，证明了时间感知、多模态序列建模对于大脑活动预测的有效性。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新颖的框架，即自由能后验网络，用于联合建模分布不确定性，并使用自由能识别 OoD 和错误分类区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从深度神经网络估计不确定性是检测分布外 (OoD) 样本的一种广泛使用的方法，这些样本通常表现出较高的预测不确定性。然而，传统的蒙特卡罗 (MC) Dropout 等方法通常只关注模型或数据不确定性，而未能与 OoD 检测的语义目标保持一致。

Method: Free-Energy Posterior Network，一个新颖的框架，它使用自由能联合建模分布不确定性并识别 OoD 和错误分类区域。我们的方法引入了两项关键贡献：（1）一种基于自由能的密度估计器，由 Beta 分布参数化，这使得能够在模糊或看不见的区域附近进行细粒度的不确定性估计；（2）一种集成在后验网络中的损失，允许直接从学习的参数估计不确定性，而无需随机抽样。通过将我们的方法与残差预测分支 (RPL) 框架集成，

Result: 我们在具有挑战性的真实世界基准上验证了我们方法的有效性，包括 Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly 和 Segment-Me-If-You-Can。

Conclusion: 通过利用 Beta 分布的方差，该方法超越了事后能量阈值，并使网络能够学习 OoD 区域，从而为不确定性感知分割提供了一种语义上有意义且计算效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge

understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Motivation: 虽然基于扩散的方法由于其强大的生成能力而显示出令人鼓舞的性能。然而，它们对退化的单向建模通常难以捕捉真实世界退化模式的复杂性，从而导致结构不一致和像素未对齐。

Method: 我们提出了一种双向扩散优化机制，该机制共同模拟弱光和正常光图像的退化过程，从而实现更精确的退化参数匹配并提高生成质量。具体来说，我们执行双向扩散（从弱光到正常光以及从正常光到弱光），并在训练期间引入自适应特征交互块 (AFI) 以优化特征表示。此外，我们设计了一个反射感知校正模块 (RACM)，以指导去噪后的颜色恢复并抑制过度曝光区域，从而确保内容一致性并生成符合人类视觉感知的高质量图像。

Result: 通过利用这两个路径之间的互补性，我们的方法对光照衰减和噪声分布施加了隐式对称约束，从而有助于一致的退化学习并提高模型感知光照和细节退化的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中均优于最新的方法，同时有效地推广到各种退化场景。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to domain shifts is crucial for autonomous systems, but manual annotation of target data is prohibitive.

Method: A novel two-stage UDA framework with unsupervised contrastive learning at the segment level for pre-training and a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy using an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures.

Result: Significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA approaches when adapting from SemanticKITTI to SemanticPOSS and SemanticSlamantic.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

*Dhruv Jain,Romain Modzelewski,Romain Hérault,Clement Chatelain,Eva Torfeh,Sebastien Thureau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba 结合了 UNet 框架与 mamba 机制，通过噪声降低模块 (NRM) 抑制编码器内的噪声激活，从而提高分割精度和鲁棒性，尤其是在低数据设置中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺的情况下，深度学习模型经常过度拟合噪声和不相关的模式，这限制了它们泛化到未见样本的能力。为了解决医学图像分割中的这些挑战

Method: 我们引入了一种新颖的架构 Diff-UMamba，它将 UNet 框架与用于建模远程依赖关系的 mamba 机制相结合。

Result: Diff-UMamba 实现了更高的分割准确性和鲁棒性，尤其是在低数据设置中。在 BraTS-21 数据集上进行了额外的实验，通过改变可用训练样本的比例，进一步评估了在有限数据条件下的性能。该方法还在一个小型内部非小细胞肺癌 (NSCLC) 数据集上进行了验证，用于锥束 CT (CBCT) 中的大体肿瘤体积 (GTV) 分割，与基线相比，实现了 4-5% 的改进。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在多个公共数据集（包括 MSD（肺和胰腺）和 AIIB23）上进行了评估，在不同的分割任务中，与基线方法相比，性能始终提高了 1-3%。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning architecture that overcomes the limitation of existing methods on large-scale datasets. It achieves better performance with a small amount of unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current micrograph analysis of metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data, most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective. MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation.

Method: a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate multi-level representations effectively

Result: segmentation models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40% improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet

Conclusion: MatSSL can effectively adapt to the metallographic domain using only a small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeEFusion是一种高效的蒸馏方法，通过将引导幅度直接融入文本嵌入，并提炼教师模型的复杂采样策略，从而在不增加额外参数的情况下，实现了更快的推理速度和可比的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像的合成技术依赖于复杂的采样策略和无分类器引导（CFG）以确保高质量生成，但CFG依赖于两次前向传递，导致推理成本过高。

Method: 通过融合条件和非条件文本嵌入，使用线性运算重建所需的引导，同时使学生模型学习教师的复杂采样方法。

Result: 在SD3等模型上的大量实验表明，TeEFusion允许学生模型以更简单、更高效的采样策略，紧密地模仿教师模型的性能。

Conclusion: TeEFusion使得学生模型在保持图像质量的同时，推理速度比教师模型快6倍。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: LEAF: a medical image segmentation model grounded in latent diffusion models, it enhances the performance of the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for different disease types, without altering the model architecture, increasing the number of parameters, or computation during inference, making it highly efficient.

Method: We propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.

TL;DR: GSDTTA是一种用于3D点云分类的新型TTA方法，它通过在图谱域中进行自适应，实现了比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D TTA方法由于点云的结构不规则和无序，依赖于计算量大的空间域优化，并且可能需要额外的训练数据，因此在3D点云上的应用受到限制。

Method: 提出了一种新的图谱域测试时自适应方法（GSDTTA），通过图傅里叶变换将点云转换到图谱域，并优化最低10%的频率分量以实现高效自适应。采用特征图引导的自训练策略迭代优化谱调整和模型参数。

Result: 实验结果和消融研究表明GSDTTA的有效性。

Conclusion: GSDTTA在3D点云分类任务上优于现有的TTA方法。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Conclusion: DATA在三个典型数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并在严重的通信延迟和姿态误差下保持了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

TL;DR: DepthDark: A new foundation model for accurate monocular depth estimation in low-light, using simulated data and a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth estimation in low-light scenarios due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets and effective PEFT strategies.

Method: The method includes a flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to generate paired depth datasets for low-light conditions, along with a low-light PEFT strategy using illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces DepthDark, a foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging nighttime datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Result: LONG3R优于最先进的流式方法，尤其是在较长的序列上，同时保持实时推理速度。

Conclusion: LONG3R在保持实时推理速度的同时，优于最先进的流式方法，尤其是在较长的序列上。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning to enhance the resilience of infrared small target detection models against real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: large and expensive manual-labeling data renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods highly fragile in real-world challenges

Method: Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning, Gaussian Group Squeezer, two-stage diffusion models

Result: enhance the resilience of ISTD models against various challenges, significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of the synthetic samples

Conclusion: Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dental caries causes lung cancer, especially squamous cell lung carcinoma, partly through reduced lung function. Periodontitis does not seem to have a causal effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational studies suggest links between periodontitis, dental caries, and lung cancer, but causality remains uncertain.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to explore causal relationships between dental traits and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess mediation by pulmonary function. Inverse variance weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed using the delta method.

Result: Dental caries has a significant positive causal effect on overall lung cancer and its subtypes, especially squamous cell lung carcinoma. This effect is partially mediated by declines in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). No causal effect was found for periodontitis.

Conclusion: Dental caries has a causal role in lung cancer risk, and integrating dental care and pulmonary function monitoring into cancer prevention strategies is recommended.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在科学领域，特别是在解释自然科学中常用的复杂领域数据方面的应用仍未得到充分探索。

Result: FieldLVLM在涉及科学领域数据的任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FieldLVLM显著优于现有方法，为大型视觉语言模型在科学研究中的应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

### [95] [Beyond Low-rankness: Guaranteed Matrix Recovery via Modified Nuclear Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18327)
*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modified nuclear norm framework for matrix recovery problems that captures both local and global information and provides theoretical recovery guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems, such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global low-rank structure of the data.

Method: The paper defines MNN family norms by adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed matrix.

Result: The MNN framework jointly captures both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off parameter tuning, and it provides exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a modified nuclear norm (MNN) framework and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

### [96] [GVCCS: A Dataset for Contrail Identification and Tracking on Visible Whole Sky Camera Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18330)
*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new open dataset of contrails (GVCCS) recorded with a ground-based camera is presented, along with a deep learning framework for contrail analysis, to support improved monitoring and calibration of physical models for better climate impact understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights.

Method: We present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model.

Result: The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. The deep learning framework performs semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and temporal tracking in a single architecture.

Conclusion: This work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models, setting the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: SGCDet是一种新颖的多视图室内3D对象检测框架，它基于自适应3D体积构建，并在ScanNet等数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的3D对象检测方法将体素的感受野限制在图像上的固定位置。

Method: 提出了一个几何和上下文感知聚合模块，以整合每个图像中自适应区域内的几何和上下文信息，并动态调整来自不同视图的贡献，从而增强体素特征的表示能力。此外，我们提出了一种稀疏体积构建策略，该策略自适应地识别和选择具有高占用概率的体素进行特征细化，从而最大限度地减少自由空间中的冗余计算。

Result: SGCDet实现了有效和高效的自适应体积构建。

Conclusion: SGCDet在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过对鸟类鸣声频谱图进行颜色编码，嵌入频率信息，显著提高了鸟类分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鸟类鸣声分类模型在低信噪比或多物种录音的情况下表现不佳，因为环境噪声、重叠的发声和缺失的标签带来了挑战。研究者假设可以通过可视化鸟类鸣声的音高模式、速度和重复性（统称为主题）来对鸟类进行分类，但不同物种的相似主题会导致混淆。

Method: 将频率信息嵌入到鸟类鸣声频谱图中，使用颜色编码来增强不同鸟类物种之间的区分度，并使用深度学习模型进行分类。

Result: 该方法在F1值上提升了7.3%，ROC-AUC提升了6.2%，CMAP提升了6.6%，超过了BirdCLEF 2024的获胜者。

Conclusion: 通过颜色编码频率信息能够有效提升鸟类鸣声分类的准确率。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExoBench基准测试，用于评估多模态大型语言模型在自我中心和外部中心视频理解和推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨第一人称（以自我为中心）和第三人称（以外部为中心）视点转移和整合知识是人类智能固有的，使人类能够向他人学习并传达自己经验的见解。尽管多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）取得了快速进展，但它们执行这种跨视角推理的能力仍有待探索。

Method: 引入EgoExoBench，这是第一个用于以自我中心和以外部中心视频理解和推理的基准。

Result: 对13个最先进的MLLM进行了评估，发现这些模型在单视角任务中表现出色，但它们难以跨视角对齐语义，准确地关联视角，并推断自我-外部环境中的时间动态。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench可以作为具身智能体和智能助手研究的宝贵资源，以寻求类人的跨视角智能。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

TL;DR: Proposes a new deformable convolutional module using attention and feedforward networks for global feature deformation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fundus blood vessel segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges.

Method: A novel plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and feedforward networks to learn offsets.

Result: GDCUnet has achieved state of the art performance on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GDCUnet model achieves state-of-the-art performance in fundus blood vessel segmentation and the deformable convolutional module enhances model representation and generalization.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR

Motivation: 目前的姿势生成方法严重依赖中间表示，无论是通过带有量化的两阶段管道还是在推理过程中累积误差的自回归模型。这种根本的限制导致性能下降，尤其是在保持时间连贯性至关重要的长期姿势生成中。

Method: 一种新颖的单阶段架构，可以直接从最小的上下文（单个 RGB 图像和文本描述）在连续坐标空间中生成姿势，同时保持训练和推理之间的一致分布。

Result: 在 Penn Action 和 First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB) 数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法明显优于现有的基于量化和自回归的方法，尤其是在长期生成场景中。

Conclusion: 该方法在长期生成场景中显著优于现有的基于量化和自回归的方法。

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method and dataset for full-body human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering, achieving state-of-the-art performance by addressing limitations in previous approaches regarding realism and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works' simplified material data and rendering equation lead to limited realism, especially for skin. The absence of constraints on material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task. End-to-end models struggle to balance the importance among various material maps, leading to underfitting.

Method: The paper designs a model (HumanMaterial) with a progressive training strategy. It uses three prior models to obtain initial material results and refines them with a finetuning model. A Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR) loss enhances the importance of materials during prior model training.

Result: The paper constructs a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF) based on scanned real data and statistical material data, including displacement and subsurface scattering to enhance realism.

Conclusion: The paper's method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynC通过重新分配字幕来优化合成图像标题数据集，从而提高零样本图像描述的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本图像描述(ZIC)越来越多地利用文本到图像(T2I)模型生成的合成数据集，以减少对昂贵的手动注释的需求。然而，这些T2I模型经常生成与其对应的输入标题在语义上不一致的图像(例如，缺少对象、不正确的属性)，从而导致嘈杂的合成图像-标题对，这可能会阻碍模型训练。

Method: 我们引入了SynC，这是一个专门为ZIC优化合成图像-文本数据集的新框架。SynC不采用传统的过滤或重新生成方法，而是侧重于将字幕重新分配给合成图像池中语义上最一致的图像。

Result: 广泛的评估表明，SynC在标准基准(MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps)上的各种ZIC模型中，持续且显著地提高了性能，在多种场景中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SynC提供了一种有效的策略来管理精炼的合成数据，以增强零样本图像描述。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Motivation: Existing deep networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized mechanism to quantify different feature strengths.

Method: DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network) introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy to quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other features and builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation architecture to dynamically balances multi-scale feature expression.

Result: On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).

Conclusion: DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods across all metrics, effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation, achieves smooth edge transitions, and significantly enhances clinical usability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

### [109] [Self-Supervised Ultrasound-Video Segmentation with Feature Prediction and 3D Localised Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18424)
*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT representations during V-JEPA pre-training for ultrasound video segmentation. The results show significant improvements in segmentation performance, especially when annotated data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging.  Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level reconstruction or negative samples. The hypothesis is that V-JEPA is well-suited to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail while effectively leveraging temporal information. ViTs can underperform on small medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and absence of hierarchical feature learning. 

Method: V-JEPA with a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT representations during V-JEPA pre-training.

Result: V-JEPA with the auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4% using 100% and up to 8.35% using only 10% of the training data.

Conclusion: V-JEPA with a 3D localisation auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various frozen encoder configurations.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

TL;DR: 本研究使用符号回归（SR）建模三维不可压缩流动，发现SR可以生成简洁且可解释的方程，并且结合知识表示方法可以提高模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，对底层流动物理的理解与准确预测同样重要，因此本研究应用SR来建模矩形通道中的基本三维（3D）不可压缩流动，重点关注层流条件下的（轴向）速度和压力场。

Method: 该研究采用PySR库直接从数值模拟数据中推导出紧凑的符号方程，并提出了一种创新方法，将SR与答案集编程（ASP）的知识表示框架相结合。

Result: 推导出的方程不仅近似了研究流体流动中观察到的抛物线速度剖面和压降，而且与文献中的解析解完全吻合。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，符号回归（SR）能够将复杂的流动行为简化为简洁、可解释的方程，并且知识表示方法有潜力提高数据驱动的SR模型与领域原则的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然这些系统有效地管理了诸如查询转换、数据转换和可视化之类的任务，但它们经常忽略分析思维背后的结构化推理过程。用于多步骤问题解决的推理大型语言模型（LLM）被训练为通用问题解决器。因此，它们的推理或思考步骤不遵循特定任务的固定过程。现实世界的数据分析需要一致的认知工作流程：解释模糊的目标，将它们扎根于上下文知识中，构建抽象计划，并根据中间结果调整执行。

Method: 我们引入了I2I-STRADA（通过结构化推理代理进行数据分析的信息到洞察），这是一种旨在形式化推理过程的代理架构。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准上的评估表明，I2I-STRADA在规划连贯性和洞察力对齐方面优于先前的系统，突出了结构化认知工作流程在数据分析的代理设计中的重要性。

Conclusion: I2I-STRADA在规划连贯性和洞察力对齐方面优于先前的系统，突出了结构化认知工作流程在数据分析的代理设计中的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Conclusion: SmartAPS provides operations planners with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Conclusion: error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned creative AI

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --

improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are

Motivation: Existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability.

Result: MAGPO outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches.

Conclusion: MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints.

Method: An Agentic AI framework with modular, task-specific agents for ingestion, anonymization, feature extraction, model selection, preprocessing, and inference.

Result: The system is evaluated on datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging, demonstrating automation of feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing.

Conclusion: The proposed Agentic AI framework automates the ML lifecycle, reducing expert intervention and offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Result: ED triage notes, containing expert, succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance.

Conclusion: This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.

Result: 在非均匀设置中，这种GNN具有与比率模态逻辑完全相同的表达能力，比具有最大聚合的GNN的表达能力更高，但低于总和聚合。在均匀设置中，相对于MSO的表达能力与无交替模态逻辑完全相同。

Conclusion: 在均匀设置中，相对于MSO，平均GNN的表达能力严格低于总和GNN和最大GNN。当任何假设被删除时，表达能力都会增加。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

TL;DR: decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning in LLMs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the capacity to distinguish between knowledge and reasoning plays a pivotal role in model analysis, interpretability, and development

Method: a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively.

Result: reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially impairing knowledge-intensive domains. Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers

Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent.

is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [122] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares four disjunction semantics in Answer Set Programming, and finds that three of them are equivalent and stronger than the fourth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: comparing semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that do not adhere to the principle of model minimality.

Method: comparing four different semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming

Result: three of these approaches (Forks, Justified Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide, constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover, this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a program and is strictly stronger than the fourth approach (Strongly Supported Models)

Conclusion: Forks, Justified Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics coincide, constituting a common single approach under different definitions. This common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a program and is strictly stronger than Strongly Supported Models

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本章介绍了一个人工智能质量风险评估的概念框架，特别是在欧盟人工智能法案的背景下。

Method: 通过整合定义平衡和可撤销推理，解决法律合规性和基本权利保护的复杂性。

Result: 这种分层方法允许对高风险人工智能系统和通用人工智能（GPAI）系统进行更有效的评估模型，强调后者的更广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 未来的工作旨在开发一个正式的模型和有效的算法，以加强人工智能风险评估，将理论见解与实际应用联系起来，以支持负责任的人工智能治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing typed student answers for correctness with respect to a ground truth solution is a challenging problem.

Method: A combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver, and a term rewriting system, with a Large Language Model used to interpret and remove errors from student responses.

Result: Automated reasoning techniques are applied to assess student solution correctness, using both off-the-shelf SMT solving and term rewriting systems.

Conclusion: The system was evaluated on 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight IB regularization method that improves LLM reasoning performance by encouraging informative and generalizable reasoning trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the development of principled methodologies for LLM reasoning.

Method: Introduce IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. Derive a practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method.

Result: Validated IB regularization across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Conclusion: IB regularization consistently improves LLM reasoning performance across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Motivation: 为了最大限度地减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间，本研究调查了强化学习(RL)在优化呼叫中心呼叫路由中的应用。

Method: 比较了两种方法：在已知系统动态下使用值迭代(VI)的基于模型的方法，以及使用近端策略优化(PPO)的从经验中学习的无模型方法。

Result: 经过1000次测试，PPO始终获得最高的回报，以及最低的客户等待时间和员工空闲时间。

Conclusion: PPO表现最好，尽管需要更长的训练时间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated Compact-Table algorithm to efficiently handle large Table constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CPU-based approaches struggle with real-world problems involving Table constraints with hundreds or thousands of valid cases.

Method: The Compact-Table (CT) algorithm is enhanced using GPUs.

Result: The design, implementation, integration, and experimental validation of the GPU-accelerated CT are reported.

Conclusion: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm for handling large Table constraints.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Conclusion: This paper investigates the effect of the data used to train probing models on their performance, focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks. The paper also makes available concept labels for two widely used datasets.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

TL;DR: VERIRAG improves RAG systems by evaluating the methodological rigor of retrieved evidence, leading to better performance across various scientific datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted.

Method: Introduce VERIRAG, a framework that includes: (i) the Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary (HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is.

Result: Across four datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset.

Conclusion: The VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. All materials necessary for reproducing our results will be released.

Abstract: In a Conversational Image Recommendation task, users can provide natural
language feedback on a recommended image item, which leads to an improved
recommendation in the next turn. While typical instantiations of this task
assume that the user's target item will (eventually) be returned, this might
often not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item
catalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user
frustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased
number of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task
of Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query
Performance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a
search engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational
performance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic
information contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.
Specifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed
representation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the
classification labels to predict the evaluation turn. Our evaluation scenario
addressed two recommendation scenarios, by differentiating between system
failure, where the system is unable to find the target, and catalogue failure,
where the target does not exist in the item catalogue. In our experiments using
the Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets, we measure the accuracy of predictors
for both system and catalogue failures. Our results demonstrate the promise of
our proposed predictors for predicting system failures (existing evaluation
scenario), while we detect a considerable decrease in predictive performance in
the case of catalogue failure prediction (when inducing a missing item
scenario) compared to system failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of turns

Method: two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and level of patience

Result: using the knowledge of alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation of existing CRS models

Conclusion: the existing single-target evaluation underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to more quickly satisfy the user.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

Motivation: Quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. Users of such systems should have the right to choose not to share highly sensitive interactions.

Method: We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method.

Result: RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

Conclusion: We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning. Our code is

### [136] [LLM-based Embedders for Prior Case Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18455)
*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper uses LLM-based text embedders to address the challenges of lengthy legal text and lack of legal training data in prior case retrieval (PCR), and shows that they outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IR methods are still used in PCR, and state-of-the-art deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to lengthy legal text limitation and lack of legal training data.

Method: Leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR in an unsupervised manner.

Result: LLM-based text embedders outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Conclusion: LLM-based text embedders outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models in four PCR benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Motivation: 先决技能是掌握更高级概念之前所需的基本能力，对于支持有效的学习、评估和技能差距分析非常重要。传统上由领域专家策划，这些关系维护成本高昂且难以扩展。本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否可以在零样本设置中预测先决技能，仅使用自然语言描述，而无需特定于任务的微调。

Method: 使用标准化的提示策略，我们评估了13个最先进的LLMs，包括GPT-4、Claude 3、Gemini、LLaMA 4、Qwen2和DeepSeek，跨越语义相似性、BERTScore和推理延迟。

Result: LLaMA4-Maverick、Claude-3-7-Sonnet和Qwen2-72B等模型生成的预测与专家ground truth非常吻合，证明了在没有监督的情况下具有强大的语义推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs可以生成与专家知识密切相关的预测，展示了在没有监督的情况下强大的语义推理能力。这些发现强调了LLMs在支持可扩展的先决技能建模在个性化学习、智能辅导和基于技能的推荐系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Prerequisite skills - foundational competencies required before mastering
more advanced concepts - are important for supporting effective learning,
assessment, and skill-gap analysis. Traditionally curated by domain experts,
these relationships are costly to maintain and difficult to scale. This paper
investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict prerequisite
skills in a zero-shot setting, using only natural language descriptions and
without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce ESCO-PrereqSkill, a benchmark
dataset constructed from the ESCO taxonomy, comprising 3,196 skills and their
expert-defined prerequisite links. Using a standardized prompting strategy, we
evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 4,
Qwen2, and DeepSeek, across semantic similarity, BERTScore, and inference
latency. Our results show that models such as LLaMA4-Maverick,
Claude-3-7-Sonnet, and Qwen2-72B generate predictions that closely align with
expert ground truth, demonstrating strong semantic reasoning without
supervision. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable
prerequisite skill modeling for applications in personalized learning,
intelligent tutoring, and skill-based recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图卷积网络（GCN）在训练推荐系统中的效率和可扩展性仍然面临严峻挑战，阻碍了它们在实际场景中的实际部署。在多模态推荐（MMRec）领域，训练 GCN 需要更昂贵的时间和空间成本，并加剧了不同模态之间的差距，导致推荐准确性欠佳。

Method: 提出 FastMMRec 框架，该框架仅在测试阶段部署图卷积。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上进行的大量实验一致表明，FastMMRec 优于其他基线模型，同时实现了效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FastMMRec在效率和可扩展性方面优于现有模型，同时缓解了模态隔离问题。

Abstract: The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in
training recommender systems remain critical challenges, hindering their
practical deployment in real-world scenarios. In the multimodal recommendation
(MMRec) field, training GCNs requires more expensive time and space costs and
exacerbates the gap between different modalities, resulting in sub-optimal
recommendation accuracy. This paper critically points out the inherent
challenges associated with adopting GCNs during the training phase in MMRec,
revealing that GCNs inevitably create unhelpful and even harmful pairs during
model optimization and isolate different modalities. To this end, we propose
FastMMRec, a highly efficient multimodal recommendation framework that deploys
graph convolutions exclusively during the testing phase, bypassing their use in
training. We demonstrate that adopting GCNs solely in the testing phase
significantly improves the model's efficiency and scalability while alleviating
the modality isolation problem often caused by using GCNs during the training
phase. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently
demonstrating the performance superiority of FastMMRec over competitive
baselines while achieving efficiency and scalability.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: STEER是一种私有向量检索框架，它利用不同嵌入模型的对齐关系来保护查询文本隐私，同时保持检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VDB服务提供商主要使用专有的黑盒模型，用户被迫通过API向他们公开原始查询文本，以换取向量检索服务。因此，如果查询文本涉及金融或医疗保健领域的机密记录，则此机制不可避免地导致用户敏感信息的严重泄漏。

Method: STEER利用不同嵌入模型的语义空间之间的对齐关系来推导查询文本的近似嵌入。

Result: STEER的Recall@100基本上可以实现小于5%的降低。此外，即使在数百万条记录的文本语料库中搜索，STEER的Recall@20准确率也比当前基线高20%。

Conclusion: STEER有效地保护了查询文本的隐私，同时保持了检索的准确性。即使近似嵌入是专有模型的嵌入的近似值，它们仍然可以防止提供商通过嵌入反演攻击（EIA）恢复查询文本。

Abstract: Vector Database (VDB) can efficiently index and search high-dimensional
vector embeddings from unstructured data, crucially enabling fast semantic
similarity search essential for modern AI applications like generative AI and
recommendation systems. Since current VDB service providers predominantly use
proprietary black-box models, users are forced to expose raw query text to them
via API in exchange for the vector retrieval services. Consequently, if query
text involves confidential records from finance or healthcare domains, this
mechanism inevitably leads to critical leakage of user's sensitive information.
To address this issue, we introduce STEER (\textbf{S}ecure \textbf{T}ransformed
\textbf{E}mbedding v\textbf{E}ctor\textbf{ R}etrieval), a private vector
retrieval framework that leverages the alignment relationship between the
semantic spaces of different embedding models to derive approximate embeddings
for the query text. STEER performs the retrieval using the approximate
embeddings within the original VDB and requires no modifications to the server
side. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that STEER
effectively safeguards query text privacy while maintaining the retrieval
accuracy. Even though approximate embeddings are approximations of the
embeddings from proprietary models, they still prevent the providers from
recovering the query text through Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs). Extensive
experimental results show that Recall@100 of STEER can basically achieve a
decrease of less than 5\%. Furthermore, even when searching within a text
corpus of millions of entries, STEER achieves a Recall@20 accuracy 20\% higher
than current baselines.

### [141] [Enhancing Quantization-Aware Training on Edge Devices via Relative Entropy Coreset Selection and Cascaded Layer Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17768)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces QuaRC, a Quantization-Aware Training framework for edge devices that uses a novel coreset selection method and cascaded layer correction to improve accuracy when training with small datasets, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) relies on complete datasets, incurring high computational costs. Coreset selection can help, but existing methods struggle with quantization errors when using small-scale datasets on edge devices due to privacy concerns and the need for efficient deployment of low-bit quantized models.

Method: The paper proposes QuaRC, a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices. It includes a coreset selection phase using a 'Relative Entropy Score' to identify subsets capturing quantization errors, and a training phase employing a 'Cascaded Layer Correction' strategy to align intermediate layer outputs of the quantized model with those of the full-precision model.

Result: QuaRC achieves a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset.

Conclusion: The proposed QuaRC framework achieves significant performance improvements in Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices, especially with small-scale datasets, as demonstrated by a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K compared to state-of-the-art techniques when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Conclusion: embedding constraints on the self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

It highlights the benefits of hyperbolic spaces for embedding hierarchical data and improving reasoning, generalization, and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have limitations in representational capacity, adaptability, and scalability. This paper explores whether alternative geometric spaces, specifically hyperbolic spaces, could better align with the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes.

Method: review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models

Result: Hyperbolic spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: This paper comprehensively reviews hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models. It further outlines key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态提前停止方法，以减少LLM调用次数，同时保持或略微降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在使用LLM根据给定的标准对项目进行排序或评估答案时，候选项目的顺序会影响模型的最终决策。这种对LLM提示中项目位置的敏感性被称为位置偏差。先前研究表明，即使在大型模型中也存在这种偏差，尽管其严重程度因模型和任务而异。除了位置偏差之外，LLM还表现出不同程度的低重复一致性，其中使用相同的候选排序重复LLM调用可能导致不同的排序。

Method: 提出了一种动态提前停止方法，该方法能够自适应地确定每个实例所需的重复次数。

Result: 动态重复策略可将LLM调用次数平均减少81%，同时保持了准确性。基于置信度的自适应提前停止方法，与静态重复相比，该方法可将LLM调用次数平均减少87%，但相对于原始提前停止方法，准确性略有下降。

Conclusion: 提出了一个动态提前停止方法，该方法能够自适应地确定每个实例所需的重复次数。在三个不同大小的LLM和两个任务（即重新排序和对齐）上评估了该方法，结果表明，过渡到动态重复策略可将LLM调用次数平均减少81%，同时保持了准确性。此外，还提出了一种基于置信度的自适应提前停止方法，与静态重复相比，该方法可将LLM调用次数平均减少87%，但相对于原始提前停止方法，准确性略有下降。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

TL;DR: CICME是一种新的因果机制估计方法，它利用因果迁移学习来检测域不变因果机制，并在某些情况下优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过因果关系视角更深入地了解复杂的传感器系统。

Method: 一种新的三步方法，用于从跨多个域收集的异构数据中推断因果机制。

Result: CICME能够可靠地检测域不变因果机制。

Conclusion: CICME在特定情况下优于基线方法。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LSDM模型，用于更准确地预测个人用户的服务级别移动流量，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测方法在不同城市环境中的适应性有限，并且由于个人流量模式的高度不确定性、缺乏详细的环境背景以及不同网络服务之间复杂的依赖关系，导致结果不准确。这些挑战需要能够捕获动态流量分布和丰富的环境特征的先进建模技术。

Method: 提出了一个LLM增强的时空扩散模型(LSDM)。LSDM集成了扩散模型的生成能力和transformers的自适应学习能力，并增强了捕获多模态环境信息的能力，用于建模服务水平模式和动态。

Result: 在真实服务级别数据集上的大量评估表明，该模型在流量使用预测方面表现出色，显示出出色的泛化性和适应性。通过LLM整合上下文信息后，性能提升至少2.83%。与同类型模型（如CSDI）相比，均方根误差可以降低至少8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM模型在流量预测方面表现出色，具有出色的泛化性和适应性。通过LLM整合上下文信息后，性能提升至少2.83%。与同类型模型相比，均方根误差降低至少8.29%。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Motivation: 解决多元时间序列分析中的两个关键挑战：提供准确的预测和实现稳健的异常检测。

Method: 一种基于Copula的多元时间序列共形异常识别(CoCAI)方法，它利用扩散模型捕获数据中的复杂依赖关系，并通过共形预测技术进行校准，结合降维技术和基于copula的建模进行异常检测。

Result: 在来自供水和污水系统的真实运营数据上进行的实验验证了CoCAI的有效性。

Conclusion: CoCAI在准确预测目标数据序列和识别其中的异常片段方面表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

TL;DR: GenSelect leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel sampling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pointwise methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale inefficiently with larger sampling budgets.

Method: LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates

Result: GenSelect outperforms existing scoring approaches with simple prompting for math reasoning.

Conclusion: Reasoning models excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

TL;DR: 本研究提出使用WGAN进行降水降尺度，结果表明WGAN提高了感知真实感，并为评估降水数据集提供了新的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率(HR)降水预测对于减少固定和局部强降雨造成的损害至关重要;然而，使用过程驱动的数值天气预报模型进行高分辨率降水预报仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络(WGAN)进行降水降尺度，具有最佳运输成本。

Result: 与使用均方误差训练的传统神经网络相比，WGAN生成了具有精细结构的可视逼真的降水场，即使WGAN在传统评估指标上表现出略低的性能。WGAN的学习评论家与人类的感知真实感密切相关。基于案例的分析表明，评论家分数的巨大差异可以帮助识别不真实的WGAN输出和参考数据中的潜在伪影。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提高了降水降尺度的感知真实感，而且为评估和质量控制降水数据集提供了新的视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络 (GNN) 在各种与图相关的任务中都取得了出色的性能。然而，它们的“黑盒”性质对它们的可解释性提出了重大挑战，并且现有方法通常无法有效地捕捉网络中节点之间复杂的交互模式。

Method: GraphEXT 利用合作博弈论和社会外部性的概念。GraphEXT 将图节点划分为联盟，将原始图分解为独立的子图。通过将图结构集成为外部性，并结合外部性下的 Shapley 值，GraphEXT 通过节点在联盟之间转换时对 GNN 预测的边际贡献来量化节点重要性。

Result: GraphEXT 更加强调节点之间的交互以及结构变化对 GNN 预测的影响。在各种 GNN 架构中，GraphEXT 在保真度方面优于现有的基线方法，从而显着增强了 GNN 模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: GraphEXT 通过在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验研究表明，在各种 GNN 架构中，其在保真度方面优于现有的基线方法，从而显着增强了 GNN 模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Motivation: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design.

Method: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules.

Result: molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks.

Conclusion: molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning

Result: 证明了MFNO可以任意程度地逼近路径依赖的随机微分方程和分数布朗运动的Lipschitz变换的解。MFNO表现出强大的分辨率泛化能力。

Conclusion: MFNO模型表现与LSTM、TCN和DeepONet等基线模型相当或更好，并且比经典数值方案提供更快的样本路径生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

TL;DR: 研究了公共-私有学习中数据分布偏移的影响，发现偏移较小时需要充足的数据，偏移较大时公共数据无用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中最有效的差分隐私机器学习算法依赖于额外的据称是公共的数据源。当这两个来源结合起来大于它们各部分之和时，这种范例最有趣。然而，在均值估计等设置中，我们有很强的下界，表明当两个数据源具有相同的分布时，组合这两个数据源没有互补价值。

Method: 将已知的公共-私有学习的下界扩展到两个数据源表现出显着分布偏移的设置。结果适用于高斯均值估计（其中两个分布具有不同的均值）和高斯线性回归（其中两个分布表现出参数偏移）。

Result: 当偏移较大时，公共数据没有提供任何好处。当偏移较小时（相对于期望的精度），公共或私有数据必须足够丰富才能估计私有参数。

Conclusion: 当偏移较大时，公共数据没有益处。当偏移较小时（相对于期望的精度），公共或私有数据必须足够丰富才能估计私有参数。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Motivation: To formally explain the origin of heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics in the Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) theory, which predicts test accuracies of pretrained SOTA NN models without access to training or testing data.

Method: The study uses techniques from statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and quantum chemistry to derive SETOL and the ERG metric. Empirical spectral density (ESD) of layer weight matrices is computed to estimate layer qualities.

Result: The study derives new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning, including a new metric, ERG, and demonstrates excellent agreement with theoretical assumptions on a simple MLP. It also shows that HTSR alpha and SETOL ERG layer quality metrics align remarkably well on both the MLP and SOTA NNs.

Conclusion: The study validates SETOL's assumptions and predictions on a simple MLP and SOTA NNs, demonstrating alignment between HTSR alpha and SETOL ERG layer quality metrics.

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Method: Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds

Result: The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average attack success rates. The expanded dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28 entropy in the original dataset

Conclusion: human-machine collaboration is important in leveraging human creativity and machine computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for continuous T2I model safety evaluation

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning, transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics.

Method: a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability and takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MFTRR框架，用于更准确地评估帖子质量，通过模拟人类认知过程，利用多模态数据，并在多个数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究存在三个主要限制：（1）将任务视为单模态分类，未能利用多模态线索和细粒度的质量区分；（2）在深度多模态融合过程中引入噪声，导致误导信号；（3）缺乏捕捉复杂语义关系（如相关性和全面性）的能力。

Method: 提出多模态细粒度主题-帖子关系推理（MFTRR）框架，该框架包含局部-全局语义相关推理模块和多层次证据关系推理模块。

Result: MFTRR在三个新建的多模态主题-帖子数据集和公共Lazada-Home数据集上进行了评估，实验结果表明MFTRR显著优于现有技术水平。

Conclusion: MFTRR显著优于现有技术水平，在Art History数据集上，相比最佳单模态方法，NDCG@3指标提升高达9.52%。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Conclusion: 该论文通过改进 GeoAggregator (GA) 模型的计算效率和可解释性，提高了预测精度和推理速度，并能有效捕捉空间效应。

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

TL;DR: SIFOTL 是一种新的表格学习方法，它使用隐私安全的数据摘要统计信息来识别导致数据偏移的因素，并且对观测噪声具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表格数据集中识别驱动数据偏移的因素对于分析和决策支持系统来说是一个重大的挑战，特别是那些关注医疗保健的系统。隐私规则限制了数据访问，而来自复杂过程的噪声阻碍了分析。

Method: SIFOTL (用于表格学习的统计信息知情的保真度优化方法)

Result: 对于模仿新的医疗保险药物补贴的 MEPS 面板数据集，SIFOTL 实现了 0.85 的 F1 分数，大大优于 BigQuery 贡献分析 (F1=0.46) 和统计测试 (F1=0.20)。在基于 Synthea ABM 生成的 18 个不同的 EHR 数据集中，SIFOTL 在没有噪声的情况下维持 0.86-0.96 的 F1 分数，即使注入观测噪声，也能维持 >= 0.75 的 F1 分数，而基线平均 F1 分数在相同的测试下范围为 0.19-0.67。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释的、注重隐私的工作流程，并且在经验上对观测噪声具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven

TL;DR: C-AAE通过压缩和匿名化处理，在可穿戴传感器数据中实现了隐私保护和数据压缩，同时保持了活动识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴加速度计和陀螺仪包含精细的行为特征，可用于重新识别用户，因此隐私保护对于医疗保健应用至关重要。

Method: 结合了匿名自编码器(AAE)与自适应差分脉冲编码调制(ADPCM)的压缩匿名自编码器(C-AAE)。AAE将原始传感器数据投影到潜在空间，保留活动相关特征，抑制身份线索。ADPCM对潜在流进行差分编码，进一步掩盖身份信息并缩小比特率。

Result: 实验表明，相对于单独的AAE，C-AAE可将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15个百分点，同时保持活动识别F1分数在未受保护的基线5个百分点以内。ADPCM还将数据量减少了大约75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在保持活动识别精度的同时，降低了用户重识别率，并减少了数据量，为医疗保健中基于传感器的活动识别提供了平衡隐私和效用的实用方法。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM是一种用于量化大型语言模型的新方法，它可以在不牺牲太多准确性的情况下显著减少模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于其巨大的参数和高计算成本，部署大型语言模型（LLM）具有挑战性。超低比特量化可以显著减少存储并加速推理，但极端的压缩（即，平均比特宽度<= 2）通常会导致严重的性能下降。

Method: Squeeze10-LLM是一个分阶段的混合精度后训练量化（PTQ）框架，通过将80%的权重 量化为1 bit，20%量化为4 bit，实现了平均每个权重1.6 bit。

Result: Squeeze10-LLM有效地将16-bit LLM的权重压缩了10倍。在LLaMA和LLaMA2上的实验表明，Squeeze10-LLM在sub-2bit的weight-only量化方面实现了最先进的性能，在六个zero-shot分类任务上的平均准确率从43%提高到56%，与现有的PTQ方法相比有了显著的提升。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM在低于2bit的权重量化方面实现了最先进的性能，在六个零样本分类任务上的平均准确率从43%提高到56%，显著优于现有的PTQ方法。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: This paper studies how additional supervision improves classification models when training data is limited. The key is the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: training data is limited due to observation costs or data scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also additional supervision, such as the confidences for the hard labels

Method: propose a theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine combination

Result: the essential component of additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label, but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled classes.  the additional supervision and the mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary roles. additional supervision determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. additional supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and asymptotic value of the error bound

Conclusion: designing additional supervision can lead to improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture, focusing on multiple MVNOs competing for physical resource blocks (PRBs).

Method: The paper proposes Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL).

Result: PDA-DRL achieves a 38% reduction in average delay compared to DRL models optimized for average delay constraints. The reward-based personalization method surpasses traditional aggregation methods.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a reward-based personalization method for model weight sharing among MVNOs, outperforming traditional aggregation methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Motivation: Existing adversarial attack approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches in diverse environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Abstract: The growing need for intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient autonomous
systems across fields such as robotics, mobile agents (e.g., UAVs), and
self-driving vehicles is driving interest in neuromorphic computing. By drawing
inspiration from biological neural systems, neuromorphic approaches offer
promising pathways to enhance the perception, decision-making, and

Motivation: 类不平衡图节点分类是一个实用但未被充分探索的研究问题。现有研究通常假设在处理类不平衡图时标签是干净且可靠的，但这通常违反了真实世界图的性质，因为真实世界图的标签经常包含噪声。因此，本文系统地研究了带噪声标签的类不平衡图的鲁棒节点分类问题。

Conclusion: GraphALP在带噪声标签的类不平衡图上实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChronoSelect uses a four-stage memory architecture to handle noisy labels by analyzing the temporal dynamics of learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels in real-world datasets degrade the generalization performance of deep neural networks.

Method: A novel four-stage memory architecture compresses prediction history into temporal distributions with a sliding update mechanism.

Result: ChronoSelect outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect achieves state-of-the-art performance on noisy data.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的图神经网络（GNN），它利用由交通参与者和矢量化道路网络组成的异构图。后者用于在多阶段方法中对目标（即预测轨迹的终点）进行分类，从而更好地推广到看不见的场景。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated learning framework for graph data that addresses the limitations of synchronous communication and topological properties, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous communication, which leads to inefficiencies. Current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods do not account for the unique topological properties of graph data, resulting in semantic drift and representational inconsistency.

Method: The authors propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.

Result: FedSA-GCL outperforms baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis on multiple real-world graph datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed FedSA-GCL method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SINDy-LOM, a method that optimizes the library of basis functions in SINDy using a two-layer optimization approach, improving model accuracy and reducing user input, validated on a diesel engine airpath system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing an appropriate library of basis functions is a major challenge in SINDy for many dynamical systems.

Method: The study proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), combining sparse regression with a novel library learning strategy. It uses a two-layer optimization architecture: an inner-layer for sparse model extraction and an outer-layer for optimizing basis functions based on recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy.

Result: The SINDy-LOM approach yields a parsimonious model, reduces user burden, and improves reliability compared to traditional SINDy, as demonstrated on a diesel engine airpath system.

Conclusion: The SINDy-LOM model exhibits good interpretability and usability due to its parsimonious nature, reduces user burden through library optimization, and enhances reliability with the RLT perspective, as validated on a diesel engine airpath system.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM在预测活动和最终结果方面表现出色，统计增强显著优于随机转换，并提高了数据的可变性，为过程预测中的训练数据丰富提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Motivation: 恶意软件快速发展，迫使基于机器学习 (ML) 的检测器不断适应。与遗忘不同，安全回归捕获样本级别的有害预测变化，例如曾经被正确检测到的恶意软件样本在模型更新后逃避检测。

Method: 调整正一致训练 (PCT) 到 CL 设置

Conclusion: 我们形式化并量化了基于 CL 的恶意软件检测器中的安全回归，并提出了一个回归感知惩罚来缓解它。具体来说，我们采用正一致训练 (PCT) 到 CL 设置，以模型无关的方式保留先前的预测行为。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 TIDSIT 的新架构，用于更准确地估计电池健康状态 (SoH)，即使在不规则的时间序列数据中也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池在这些系统的效率和安全性方面起着核心作用，但由于重复的充电-放电循环，它们不可避免地会随着时间的推移而退化。这种退化会导致能源效率降低和潜在的过热，从而带来重大的安全隐患。因此，准确估计电池的健康状态 (SoH) 对于确保运行可靠性和安全性至关重要。诸如 LSTM、Transformer 和基于编码器的模型等多种机器学习架构已被提出以从放电循环数据中估计 SoH。然而，这些模型难以处理现实世界测量中固有的不规则性：放电读数通常以非均匀的间隔记录，并且放电循环的长度差异很大。为了解决这个问题，大多数现有方法从序列中提取特征而不是完整地处理它们，这会导致信息丢失并损害准确性。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的架构：时间感知动态序列反向 Transformer (TIDSIT)。TIDSIT 结合了连续时间嵌入来有效地表示不规则采样数据，并利用带有时间注意力机制的填充序列来管理可变长度输入，而不会丢弃序列信息。

Result: 在 NASA 电池退化数据集上的实验结果表明，TIDSIT 显着优于现有模型，在预测误差方面降低了 50% 以上，并将 SoH 预测误差保持在 0.58% 以下。

Conclusion: TIDSIT显著优于现有模型，在预测误差方面降低了 50% 以上，并将 SoH 预测误差保持在 0.58% 以下。该架构具有通用性，并有望在涉及不规则时间序列数据的健康监测任务中实现更广泛的应用。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: MARL智能体通过学习简单的惯例来绕过环境观察和记忆，而不是有效地进行马尔可夫信号恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无模型的MARL算法使用简单的循环函数逼近器来应对使用部分信息推理他人的挑战。我们认为，这些方法的经验上的成功不是由于有效的马尔可夫信号恢复，而是由于学习简单的惯例，绕过环境观察和记忆。

Method: 通过有针对性的案例研究

Result: 共同适应的智能体可以学习脆弱的惯例，当与非适应性智能体合作时，这些惯例会失败。当任务设计需要时，相同的模型可以学习基于基础的策略，这表明问题不是学习模型的基本限制，而是基准设计的失败。

Conclusion: 当前的MARL环境可能没有充分测试Dec-POMDP的核心假设。因此，我们提倡建立在两个核心原则之上的新的合作环境：(1)以观察为基础的行为；(2)基于记忆的关于其他智能体的推理，确保成功需要真正的技能，而不是脆弱的、共同适应的协议。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Motivation: HyperDeepONets improve expressivity but incur high memory and computational costs due to the large number of output parameters required.

Method: Introduces PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank matrices.

Result: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70% reduction in parameters and consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieves up to 70% reduction in parameters and consistently outperforms regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods which are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach enabling efficient and effective uncertainty estimation in LLMs by distilling uncertainty-aware teacher models into compact student models fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Two distillation strategies are compared: one with softmax-based outputs and another leveraging Dirichlet-distributed outputs for epistemic uncertainty modeling.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

### [191] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HYPER is a novel method for discharge prediction that combines multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing, achieving robust, efficient, and generalizable results, especially in data-scarce conditions and ungauged basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major challenge. many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill of rainfall-runoff analyses.

Method: HYdrological Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 uncalibrated catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear regression to correct errors in the BMA output

Result: In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55) but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23% of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).

Conclusion: HYPER provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide range of regions. These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的bisimulation metric，解决了传统方法中的两个问题，并在实验中证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的bisimulation metric存在两个主要问题：1) 无法表示某些独特的场景；2) 在递归更新过程中，依赖于预定义的奖励差异和后续状态的权重。

Method: 通过引入state-action pair的度量，提出了改进的bisimulation metric。

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Meta-World两个代表性基准上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了改进的bisimulation metric，具有更精确的奖励差距定义和具有自适应系数的新型更新算子。为所提出的metric及其改进的表示独特性提供了收敛的理论保证。在DeepMind Control和Meta-World两个代表性基准上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

*Zhongtian Sun,Anoushka Harit,Alexandra Cristea,Christl A. Donnelly,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLANCE enhances GNNs on heterophilous graphs using logic, graph refinement, and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle on heterophilous graphs due to indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns.

Method: Integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets (Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin).

Conclusion: GLANCE achieves competitive performance on heterophilous graphs, offering robust and interpretable solutions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

TL;DR: C2G-KD: a data-free knowledge distillation framework using class-conditional generator and PCA-based geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generator never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's output through a combination of semantic and structural losses.

Method: a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA

Result: By constraining generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and diversity.

Conclusion: Even minimal class structure is sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a

### [195] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law that unifies diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection, providing a foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences.

Method: a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$.

Result: The force $\mathbf{f}$ drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$ rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables exploration.

Conclusion: This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics, Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了GPTQ在特定条件下等价于Babai算法，为其提供了坚实的理论基础，并为未来的量化算法设计提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型语言模型（LLM）的权重从16位量化到更低的位宽，是将海量Transformer部署到更经济的加速器上的事实方法。GPTQ是LLM规模上单次训练后量化的标准方法之一，但其内部运作被描述为一系列特殊的代数更新，掩盖了几何意义或最坏情况保证。

Method: 通过复杂的数学论证，证明了GPTQ与Babai最近平面算法在特定条件下的数学等价性。

Result: GPTQ等价于Babai最近平面算法，误差传播步骤获得了直观的几何解释。

Conclusion: GPTQ在满足无裁剪条件时，继承了Babai算法的误差上限，为未来十亿参数模型的量化算法设计开启了大门。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Motivation: 在人工智能日益普及的高风险领域和决策中，测试潜在的危害和偏见至关重要。尤其是在行业环境中，法律和隐私问题限制了收集评估群体差异所需的人口统计数据，审计员在获取数据方面面临实际和文化挑战。此外，内部历史数据集通常不具有足够的代表性来识别真实世界的偏差。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种克服公平性测试中真实数据稀缺问题的方法，通过构建包含人口统计信息的完整合成数据，实现了独立的、模型无关的公平性评估。

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.
