They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined.

As a crucial component for developing\nthese reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through\ntrial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent\non-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.\nIn this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a\nnovel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy\nupdate and length-restricted response generation.

A\ngating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's\nability to model sequential dependencies.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling\nsingle-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations\nusing MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data\nstorage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the\ncomplexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By\nleveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the\ntraining stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,\nincluding PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO.

These parameters have\ntraditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to\nchallenges in case of sensor faults.

To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution\nas well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning\nmethodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and\nonflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network\n(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights\nof this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally\nexecuting transfer learning by retraining these layers.

Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage\nand retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater\nstorage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during\nretrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate\nthis issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single\nlane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of\nmulti-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to\naddress the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous\nitem configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the\nobjective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel.

However, prior work has largely overlooked a\ncritical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.\nIn this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding\nmodel -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center\nof analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder\ntypes, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC\nperformance. Our experiments show that the training success and the\nout-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are\npretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based\nFSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the\ntraining distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.\nCode can be found at https://github.com/PictSure/pictsure-library.", "AI": {"tldr": "PictSure \u662f\u4e00\u79cd ICL \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u9ebb\u70e6\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e ICL \u7684 FSIC \u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 PictSure\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a ICL \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38 FSIC \u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6210\u529f\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "PictSure\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e ICL \u7684 FSIC \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet.

However, most\nexisting multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial\nreasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to\nmore complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional\nreasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach\nPeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy\ndesigned to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving\nlearning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce\npermutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to\nexplore more spatial and positional diversity.

A\ncloser examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a\nmismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to\nunrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during\ncompression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these\ntwo distributions, achieving near 100\\% codebook utilization and significantly\nreducing the quantization error.

(2) an adaptive collaboration engine that\ndynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based\non task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies\ncombining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance\nacross diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best\nbaseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME\n(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval.

For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and\nGuru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open\nmodels RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by\n7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We\nalso show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their\nbase models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining\ndata.

The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural\narchitecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic\ntensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time\nintervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism\nemploys Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while\nstacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations\nto capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban\ntraffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that\neliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise\nthe learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density\nof merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous\napproaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely\nheavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar\npoints to construct accurate depth priors.

However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass\nthe retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce\nRetrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects\nsuch behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal\nimpact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,\nrequires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single\nadditional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the\nKL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the\nPrompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result\noutperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping\nlatency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.
