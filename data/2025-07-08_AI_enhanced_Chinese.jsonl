Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of\nmainstream BR models will fluctuate or even decline regarding item-level\nvariability. This paper makes the first attempt to referencaddress the above\nproblem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle\nRecommendation(RDiffBR) as a model-agnostic generative framework which can\nassist a BR model in adapting this scenario.

Traditional methods for constructing these\nmaps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,\nlabor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online\napproaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited\nperformance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network\ndesigned to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.\nLeveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts\ntime-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.\nThis integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate\nmodules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)\nconversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error\npropagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping\ncompleteness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under\npractical deployment constraints.

Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing\nintra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary\ncombinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.\nExisting diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,\nRGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial\ncorrespondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies.

Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a\nhierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution\nconditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of\nlatent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel\nrelationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary\nsubsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking\nstrategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of\ninputs.

Using four real-world POI datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare,\nGowalla, and Yelp), we analyze the individual and combined effects of these\napproaches on recommendation accuracy and popularity bias.

In long-term planning tasks,\nhowever, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize\nplanning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to\nanalyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules\nthat improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft\ndiamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving\nefficiency compared to baseline LLM planners.

Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs)\nto infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary\nclassification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships.\nIn this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels\n(FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user\npurchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a\nhuman-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that\nit covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then\nevaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could\naccurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated\ncomplementary labels align with human perception.

However, these systems face two main issues: the\nunderutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain\nalignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target\ndomain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space\ndistribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal\ndata and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC).

We first propose a diversified\nscene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by\nincorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target\ndiversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by\nconsidering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to\nenhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean\naverage precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for\nthe test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear\ncoefficients of $\\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\\pm 10$ degrees), showing\nsignificant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible\nadditional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVR-YOLO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DSE\u548cKOF\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PCB\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u8def\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4f7f\u5f97\u7535\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVR-YOLO\u7684\u589e\u5f3aPCB\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eYOLOv8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u589e\u5f3a\uff08DSE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u805a\u7126\uff08KOF\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684PCB\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u503c\uff08mAP\uff09\u4e3a98.9%\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u503c\u4e3a94.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "VR-YOLO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PCB\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations.

The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario.

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision.

There is an increasing effort to\nendow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand\nand manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a\nnew evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial\ndeformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial\ndeformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can\ngenerate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any\ndata leakage.

This paper proposes a\nlightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),\nwhich transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex\nteacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher\nmodel follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its\nlatent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency\ntrends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).\nHowever, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in\nslow training and high memory usage.

Evaluating Generalist Text Embeddings for Zero-Shot Recommendation and Search", "comment": "Accept as Short Paper at RecSys 2025", "summary": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic\nrepresentations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential\nrecommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,\nwhile in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.\nRecent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to\nimprove representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing\nthat Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale\ncorpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized\nadaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and\nfine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search.

However, existing\nLLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information\ninherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental\narchitectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention\nmechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings\ndesigned primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.\nThis limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of\nuser preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\n  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal\nFramework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal\ninference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact\nof temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal\norder as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can\nquantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing\nwhat recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while\nkeeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to\ndesign a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the\nmodel's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute\ntimestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories.

In this\nway, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride\nlength. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners\ndemonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and\ntraining. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the\ngait parameters of athletes.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a computer vision method to estimate stride length and speed from videos, showing its potential for athlete coaching and training.", "motivation": "Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete.", "method": "A computer vision-based approach using probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose detection algorithm to estimate leg joint position and homography transformation to estimate runner stride length.", "result": "Experiments on various race videos with three different runners demonstrated the system's usefulness.", "conclusion": "The proposed system is a useful tool for coaching and training, with potential value in measuring and monitoring the gait parameters of athletes."}}

Two recent\ntechnological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that\ncombines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of\nquantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log\ndata,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but\nthat can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second\nis the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern\nrecognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step\ntoward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to\ntransform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's\nlife trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call\nthis data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of\nour approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different\nfacets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch\npopulation-scale registry data.

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on\nseveral established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,\nit demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets\nsettings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent\nembeddings for generated image detection.

Our central thesis is\nthat for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful\ncomputation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make\nperfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a\nthree-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal\napproximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of\npractical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we\nprove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional\nto the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any\ntheoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the\nability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the\ndense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical\nNecessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is\nempirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing\nany successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency.

To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world\ncompound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an\naverage improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for\nimproving compound systems.

A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of\nartificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these\nquestions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,\nsuch as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural\nnetworks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --\nrepresent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging\nempirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior\nas models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),\nwhich have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same\ntask. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions\nabout the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to\ncomplete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere\nimplementation of the pLoT solution.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that\nleverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on\nGoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback\ninto continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals\nthrough lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random\ntrace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter\nPreference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,\nenabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly\non these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels.

To mitigate these\nissues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where\nLLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing\nMAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes\nLLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences\nperformance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM\nagents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called \"CortexDebate\".\nInspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically\noptimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate\nconstructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only\ndebates with the ones that are helpful to it.

However, its reliance on symmetric,\ndata-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning\nor simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the\n\\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that\nreframes inference as a \\emph{goal-seeded}, \\emph{asymmetric} process grounded\nin structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from\nsensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on\nabstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle\nof forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation\nintegrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,\nenforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and\nrecognition-based reconstructions.
