### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型中的偏差主要受预训练的影响，而不是微调或随机噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 表现出认知偏差，类似于人类中观察到的那些。先前的研究发现，这些偏差因模型而异，并且可以通过指令调整来放大。然而，目前尚不清楚这些偏差的差异是源于预训练、微调，还是甚至是由于训练随机性造成的随机噪声。

Method: 通过控制随机种子和交换指令数据集，使用两步因果实验方法来解开这些因素

Result: 偏差主要由预训练塑造：具有相同预训练骨干模型的模型表现出比仅共享微调数据的模型更相似的偏差模式

Conclusion: 预训练对偏差的影响大于微调的影响

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs used in surveys show biases similar to humans, especially a recency bias, highlighting the need for careful prompt design and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood.

Method: Testing nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying 11 perturbations to question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations and a consistent recency bias are revealed. Larger models are generally more robust, but all models remain sensitive to semantic variations and to combined perturbations.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit a consistent recency bias and sensitivity to semantic variations and combined perturbations, aligning partially with human survey response biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for comprehensive evaluations of synthetic text, which improves the viability of synthetic text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems in high-stakes domains.

Method: The toolkit allows users to conduct evaluations along multiple dimensions over synthetic data that they upload or generate using the toolkit's generation module.

Result: The toolkit's functionality and effectiveness are highlighted over datasets from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law.

Conclusion: The toolkit aims to improve the viability of synthetic text and privacy preservation in AI development by consolidating and standardizing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new safety evaluation protocol and benchmark for medical LLMs, addressing the safety concerns raised by their use in medical applications. The study evaluates the safety of medical LLMs from patient, clinician, and general user perspectives using red-teaming protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks.

Method: introduction of a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. applying our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study

Result: quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs

Conclusion: This paper defines safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes interruption detection in single and multi-group settings, creates a method robust to overlapping speech, and highlights linguistic and prosodic information about interruptions in collaborative group interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context, overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be identified in other ways.

Method: The study analyzes interruption detection in single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings.

Result: The study creates a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech.

Conclusion: The study creates a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech, and highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. The investigation also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543)
*Chen Amiraz,Yaroslav Fyodorov,Elad Haramaty,Zohar Karnin,Liane Lewin-Eytan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了阿拉伯语-英语 RAG，发现检索是跨语言场景中的瓶颈，并提出了一种简单的检索策略来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言检索增强生成 (RAG) 是一项关键功能，用于跨语言检索和生成答案。然而，先前的工作主要集中在生成上，并且依赖于来自开放域源（最著名的是 Wikipedia）的基准。在这种情况下，由于语言不平衡、与预训练数据的重叠以及记忆内容，检索挑战通常仍然隐藏。

Method: 使用从真实世界的公司数据集衍生的基准，在领域特定的环境中研究阿拉伯语-英语 RAG。

Result: 检索是跨语言领域特定场景中的一个关键瓶颈，当用户查询和支持文档的语言不同时，性能会显著下降。通过强制从两种语言中平等检索，可以解决这个问题，从而显著提高跨语言和整体性能。

Conclusion: 检索是跨语言领域特定场景中的一个关键瓶颈，当用户查询和支持文档的语言不同时，性能会显著下降。通过强制从两种语言中平等检索，可以解决这个问题，从而显著提高跨语言和整体性能。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent LLM framework for generating better counterspeech against health misinformation by improving knowledge retrieval and response refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on using LLMs with RAG for generating counterspeech against misinformation have limited evidence and control over outputs.

Method: A multi-agent retrieval-augmented framework incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. The approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy. Ablation studies verify the necessity of each component, and human evaluations show refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent retrieval-augmented framework effectively generates high-quality counterspeech against health misinformation, outperforming baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy. Human evaluations confirm the significant enhancement of counterspeech quality through refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vec2Text 可以从文本嵌入中重建原始文本，但存在局限性。量化是一种潜在的防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vec2Text 表明受控解码可以从黑盒嵌入中成功地重建原始文本，这对传统观点提出了挑战，促使我们进一步验证。

Method: 重现 Vec2Text 框架，并通过有针对性的实验进行扩展研究。

Result: Vec2Text 在理想条件下有效，能够重建甚至缺乏明确语义的密码式序列。但是，我们发现了一些关键限制，包括其对输入序列长度的敏感性。我们还发现高斯噪声和量化技术可以减轻 Vec2Text 带来的隐私风险，其中量化提供了一种更简单、更广泛适用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 需要谨慎使用文本嵌入，并强调进一步研究 NLP 系统稳健的防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型架构，结合 GNN 和 CNN，并通过高效的字典查找整合来自 LLM 的信息，以提高处理长文本的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习（DL）中的时间、成本和能源效率至关重要，尤其是在处理长文本时。Transformer 作为当前最先进的技术，相对于输入长度表现出二次计算复杂度，使其在处理扩展文档时效率低下。

Method: 结合图神经网络（GNNs）和卷积神经网络（CNNs），集成实时端到端图生成机制。

Result: 生成的图表现出有意义的语义组织的结构特性，平均聚类系数约为 0.45，平均最短路径长度在 4 到 5 之间。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在多个文本分类任务中表现出效率和竞争力。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健领域，从临床决策支持到改善结果的面向患者的聊天机器人，生成式人工智能已经显示出强大的潜力。部署的一个关键挑战是有效的人工智能交流，其中内容必须既个性化又易于理解。

Method: MedReadCtrl，一个可读性控制的指令调整框架，使LLM能够在不影响意义的情况下调整输出复杂度。

Result: 在医学和通用领域的九个数据集和三个任务的评估表明，MedReadCtrl实现了比GPT-4显著更低的可读性指令遵循错误（例如，在ReadMe上为1.39 vs. 1.59，p<0.001），并在未见过的临床任务上提供了显著的收益（例如，在MTSamples上+14.7 ROUGE-L，+6.18 SARI）。专家们一致更喜欢MedReadCtrl（71.7% vs. 23.3%），尤其是在低文化水平的情况下。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能够将临床内容重构为可访问的、与可读性一致的语言，同时保留医疗意图，为支持患者教育和扩大AI支持的医疗服务的公平访问提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop

categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自学行动审议 (SAND) 框架，使 LLM 代理能够在提交行动之前明确地考虑候选行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 代理通常通过对 ReAct 风格的专家轨迹进行监督微调或对成对 rollouts 进行偏好优化来进行调整。这些方法中的大多数侧重于模仿特定的专家行为或提升所选的推理思想和行动，而不是拒绝的那些。然而，由于行动空间探索有限，如果没有对替代行动进行推理和比较，使用这些方法进行微调的 LLM 代理可能会过度承诺看似合理但次优的行动。

Method: 本文提出了一种自学行动审议 (SAND) 框架，使 LLM 代理能够在提交行动之前明确地考虑候选行动。为了解决在给定大动作空间和步级动作评估的情况下何时以及审议什么的挑战，我们结合了自我一致性动作抽样和执行引导的动作评论，以帮助使用 LLM 代理的基本模型合成步进式动作审议思想。然后以迭代方式将审议轨迹用于微调 LLM 代理本身。

Result: SAND 比初始监督微调平均提高了 20%，并且优于最先进的代理调整方法。

Conclusion: SAND在两个代表性的交互式代理任务上评估，比初始监督微调平均提高了 20%，并且优于最先进的代理调整方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

TL;DR: RLEP是一种强化学习框架，通过重放高质量的轨迹来提高大型语言模型的训练效率和性能，并在数学问题上取得了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的强化学习（RL）是一项能源密集型的工作：训练可能不稳定，策略可能会逐渐偏离其预训练的权重。

Method: RLEP，一种两阶段框架，首先收集验证的轨迹，然后在随后的训练过程中重放它们。在每一个更新步骤中，策略都在混合了新生成的rollout和这些重放的成功案例的mini-batch上进行优化。

Result: 在AIME-2024上的准确率从38.2%提高到39.9%，在AIME-2025上的准确率从19.8%提高到22.3%，在AMC-2023上的准确率从77.0%提高到82.2%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量的例子，引导模型远离无效的探索，并将学习集中在有希望的推理路径上，从而更快地收敛并获得更强的最终性能。在Qwen2.5-Math-7B基础模型上，RLEP以更少的更新次数达到基线峰值精度，并最终超过它，在AIME-2024上的准确率从38.2%提高到39.9%，在AIME-2025上的准确率从19.8%提高到22.3%，在AMC-2023上的准确率从77.0%提高到82.2%。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了 machine bullshit 的概念框架和量化指标，并通过实验发现模型微调和CoT prompting会加剧 machine bullshit 现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究主要集中在LLM的幻觉和奉承上，本文提出 machine bullshit 作为一个总括性的概念框架，可以使研究人员能够表征 LLM 中涌现的真实性丧失的更广泛现象，并阐明其潜在机制。

Method: 提出 Bullshit Index 指标量化 LLMs 对事实的漠视程度，并提出一个互补的分类法，分析四种定性的 bullshit 形式：空洞的言辞、含糊其辞、推诿和未经证实的声明。

Result: RLHF 显著加剧了 bullshit，推理时 CoT prompting 明显放大了特定的 bullshit 形式，尤其是在政治语境中，weasel words 是一种主要策略。 

Conclusion: 模型微调和CoT prompting会加剧 machine bullshit 现象，政治语境下 machine bullshit 也很普遍。AI alignment 存在系统性挑战。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING：一个统一的后训练框架，它提炼来自大规模LLM的综合任务分解（称为“规划轨迹”），并通过监督和强化学习目标微调较小的模型，旨在模仿这些规划过程，以提高复杂的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用后训练期间的规划结构来提高较小的开源LLM的性能仍有待探索。因此，我们引入PLAN-TUNING。

Method: PLAN-TUNING，一个统一的后训练框架，通过监督和强化学习目标微调较小的模型，以模仿这些规划过程，从而改进复杂的推理。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准测试中，经过计划调整的模型比强大的基线模型平均高出约7%。此外，经过计划调整的模型在领域外数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上的性能分别平均提高了约10%和约12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是一种有效的策略，可以提高较小LLM的特定任务性能。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

TL;DR: TeaR利用数据管理和强化学习来提升LLM的推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现出显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型研究领域的中心重点仍然是增强推理能力。一个有希望的方向是要求模型逐步模拟代码执行，从而得出给定输入的输出。然而，由于代码通常是为大型系统设计的，直接应用会导致过度依赖复杂的数据结构和算法，即使对于简单的情况也是如此，从而导致过度拟合算法模式，而不是核心推理结构。

Method: TeaR利用精心的数据管理和强化学习来指导模型在代码相关任务中发现最佳推理路径。

Result: 在两个基础模型和三个long-CoT蒸馏模型（模型大小从15亿到320亿个参数不等）以及跨越数学、知识、代码和逻辑推理的17个基准测试中进行了广泛的实验。结果一致表明性能得到了显著提高。值得注意的是，TeaR在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了35.9%的改进，在R1-Distilled-7B上实现了5.9%的改进。

Conclusion: TeaR通过指导模型发现代码相关任务中的最佳推理路径，从而提高通用推理能力。在涵盖数学、知识、代码和逻辑推理的17个基准测试中，结果显示性能得到了显著提高。值得注意的是，TeaR在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了35.9%的改进，在R1-Distilled-7B上实现了5.9%的改进。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and diversity of textual data.

Method: A named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT

Result: The fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.

Conclusion: Domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT for ORR catalyst extraction.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Conclusion: LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present

TL;DR: 构建了一个中文心理支持对话数据集(CPsDD)，并提出了一个综合代理对话支持系统(CADSS)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不断增加的压力，对心理支持的需求不断增长，这暴露了相关数据集的稀缺性，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 利用有限的真实世界数据和专家知识来微调两个大型语言模型：对话生成器和对话修改器。

Result: 构建了中文心理支持对话数据集(CPsDD)，包含68K个对话，涵盖13个组、16个心理问题、13个原因和12个支持重点。引入了综合代理对话支持系统(CADSS)。

Conclusion: CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上，策略预测和情感支持对话(ESC)任务均实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 传统研究主要涉及二元环境，本研究侧重于将语音活动预测 (VAP) 应用于预测三人多方场景中即将发生的轮流发言。

Method: 将语音活动预测 (VAP) 应用于预测三人多方场景中即将发生的轮流发言。

Result: 在日语三人数据集上训练的多个模型表明，在三人对话中训练的 VAP 优于所有模型的基线，但对话类型会影响准确性。

Conclusion: VAP 可以用于三人对话场景中的轮流发言。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To present a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting in the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation campaign.

Method: LLMs with carefully designed prompts and advanced prompt engineering techniques (debating LLMs and various example selection strategies)

Result: Achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. The method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot learning is effective and adaptable for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional fine-tuning, especially when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

TL;DR: SFT and RL have different effects on VLMs, and combining them doesn't always work well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty about the joint effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in VLMs.

Method: Systematic investigation into the roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Result: SFT improves performance on difficult questions but degrades performance on simpler ones; RL promotes generalization and brevity; combining them fails to produce additive benefits.

Conclusion: Combining SFT and RL for VLMs doesn't produce additive benefits and leads to trade-offs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Conclusion: M4Doc在翻译质量方面取得了显著的进步，特别是在跨领域泛化和具有挑战性的文档图像场景中。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Motivation: 离散扩散语言模型

Method: 通过展示前向掩蔽分布下的预期去噪器输出恢复了干净 token 上的精确后验，揭示了离散扩散语言模型的隐藏贝叶斯核心。在最小假设下，对 K 个独立 corruptions 的蒙特卡罗边缘化以 O(1/sqrt(K)) 的速率收敛到该后验，从而产生了一个简单的收敛性证明和有限样本误差界限。

Result: 在 WikiText-2 上，该方法在 K=8 时的测试困惑度为 8.8，而 GPT-2 Small 的困惑度为 20.3，尽管使用了大小相当的模型。

Conclusion: 介绍了一种轻量级的推理时间集成方法，该方法平均 K 个 mask-and-denoise 过程以获得后验感知 token 概率和不确定性估计，且无需额外的训练成本。在 WikiText-2 上，该方法在 K=8 时的测试困惑度为 8.8，而 GPT-2 Small 的困惑度为 20.3，尽管使用了大小相当的模型。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种NLP任务中表现出色，但其计算需求阻碍了它们在资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏压缩LLM，并评估Pythia和Qwen2.5模型在SQuAD和MLQA上的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of retrieval searches in RAG. The paper finds that large-scale fine-tuning is not needed, and Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help reduce the number of searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attempts at improving RAG focus on accuracy and recall, while efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention.

Method: A standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts and Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning.

Result: A standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches).

Conclusion: Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, and Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

TL;DR: This paper studies Chinese phonetic cloaking in online toxicity and finds current models are weak. A new dataset and mitigation technique are introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) is a major obstacle to Chinese content moderation, and existing evaluations rely on synthetic perturbations that ignore the creativity of real users.

Method: The study compiles a dataset of 500 naturally occurring, phonetically cloaked offensive posts and benchmarks state-of-the-art LLMs. It also revisits a Pinyin-based prompting strategy.

Result: The best model reaches an F1-score of 0.672 on the dataset, and a Pinyin-based prompting strategy recovers much of the lost accuracy.

Conclusion: This study introduces a taxonomy of Chinese Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), a realistic benchmark dataset, and a mitigation technique for toxicity detection.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 依赖于语义意义的保留和摘要长度的压缩，评估任意文本的摘要质量。

Method: 提出了一种新的定量客观指标，即保留归一化指标（NOIR）。

Result: 实验表明，NOIR指标可以有效地衡量摘要器的token长度/语义保留的权衡，并且与人类对摘要质量的感知相关。

Conclusion: NOIR指标可以有效地衡量摘要器的token长度/语义保留的权衡，并且与人类对摘要质量的感知相关。它为评估摘要质量提供了一种自动替代方案，无需依赖耗时的人工生成的参考摘要。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS) to improve attention mechanism performance by simulating larger attention heads and feature dimensions with minimal parameter overhead, achieving significant improvements on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of multi-head attention (MHA) improves as the number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains sufficiently large. Increasing both the head count and hidden size per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance gains at a low cost.

Method: The paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS), which simulates a larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a higher-dimensional space. It also extends the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings and proposes Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) to control the parameter cost.

Result: The proposed SAS method achieves significant improvements over different attention variants on a variety of datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Simulated Attention Score (SAS) method achieves significant improvements over different attention variants on a variety of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

TL;DR: K2RAG是一种新的RAG框架，它集成了密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要，以提高检索质量和系统效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当重新训练大型语言模型(llm)以包含更大的知识体系时，微调是一个资源密集型的过程。虽然已经开发了许多微调技术来减少所涉及的时间和计算成本，但随着llm的规模和复杂性不断增长，这一挑战依然存在。

Method: 集成了密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要的K2RAG框架

Result: K2RAG的平均答案相似度得分最高，为0.57，第三四分位数(Q3)相似度最高，为0.82，表明与真实答案的对齐更好。此外，通过总结步骤，单个组件的平均训练时间减少了93%，执行速度比传统的基于知识图的RAG系统快40%。K2RAG还展示了卓越的可扩展性，与本研究中测试的几种naive RAG实现相比，它需要的VRAM减少了三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG实现了比传统RAG更高的准确率、效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

Motivation: Not all tokens contribute equally to model performance in post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs).

Method: A selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model.

Result: Selective-DPO method outperforms standard DPO and distillation-based baselines on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench.

Conclusion: Token-level optimization and reference model selection are important in advancing preference alignment for LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Conclusion: This review provides a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future of legal AI.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni, a unified LSLM with speech CoT, addresses the challenges of StreamST by simultaneously handling speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing StreamST methods rely on sentence-level speech segments and segmentation models, which limits contextual information and complicates policy learning.

Method: The paper proposes StreamUni, a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) that incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to generate multi-stage outputs for simultaneous speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation. A streaming CoT training method is also introduced to enhance low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that StreamUni achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed StreamUni model achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识集成到数据驱动的学习算法中。如果这些嵌入在语义上是一致的，即如果相似的规范被映射到附近的向量中，它们可以直接在公式的语义空间中实现连续学习和优化。然而，为了将最佳连续表示转换为具体的需求，这些嵌入必须是可逆的。

Method: 训练一个基于Transformer的仅解码器模型，以反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入。

Result: 该模型仅需1个epoch即可生成有效公式，并在约10个epoch内泛化到逻辑语义。该模型能够解码给定的嵌入为公式，这些公式在长度和嵌套方面通常更简单，同时在语义上与黄金参考保持接近（或等效）。

Conclusion: 该模型能够将给定的嵌入解码成公式，这些公式在长度和嵌套方面通常更简单，同时在语义上与黄金参考保持接近（或等效）。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Motivation: 尽管指令微调非常重要，但很少有人关注所用损失函数的优化。一个基本但经常被忽视的问题是，传统的自回归目标（其中仅在响应tokens上计算损失，不包括prompt tokens）对于指令微调是否真的是最优的。

Method: 提出了加权指令微调（WIT），作为传统指令微调的更好替代方案。

Result: 通过对五个不同系列和规模的语言模型、三个不同规模的微调数据集和五个不同的评估基准进行的大量实验，表明标准指令微调损失通常会产生次优的性能，并且对输入提示变化的鲁棒性有限。

Conclusion: 标准指令微调损失通常会产生次优的性能，并且对输入提示变化的鲁棒性有限。对prompt tokens使用低到中等的权重，再加上对response tokens使用中到高的权重，可以产生在各种设置中性能最佳的模型，并且也可以作为后续偏好对齐训练的更好起点。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

Result: no improvements in machine translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling.

Conclusion: The conditional tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram tokenizers, results are mixed: no improvements in machine translation quality, but consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling. Quadratic scaling of conditional probability estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency bottleneck, and alternative parameterizations may be necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning.

Method: Systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. Comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks.

Result: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness, mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution, and smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process.

Conclusion: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance, especially for smaller models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.

Method: The paper introduces a nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. It formalizes this through a composite operator $\phi(\\cdot, \\gamma(\\cdot))$.

Result: The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed externally. The verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma.

Conclusion: The paper proves a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. The paper also functions as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI embedding spaces.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Result: DocCHA 在两个真实世界的中文咨询数据集（IMCS21、DX）上进行了评估，始终优于强大的基于提示的 LLM 基线（GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、LLaMA-3），诊断准确率提高了 5.18%，症状召回率提高了 30% 以上，而对话轮数仅略有增加。

Conclusion: DocCHA在实现结构化、透明和高效的诊断对话方面表现出色，为在多语言和资源受限的环境中开发值得信赖的LLM临床助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

*Achuth Chandrasekhar,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline using LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash) to streamline the generation of MD input files, reducing setup time and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process.

Method: an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files. Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE, a VLM-based framework, enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO), achieving superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle in industrial anomaly detection and reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection.

Method: We propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO).

Result: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing solutions remain fundamentally limited in their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time.

Method: introducing MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system consisting of six distinct memory types (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault), coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval.

Result: MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline on ScreenshotVQA while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%, and attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4% on LOCOMO.

Conclusion: MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 隐式奖励模型和显式奖励模型之间存在泛化差距，这是因为隐式奖励模型更依赖于表面的token级别线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）的泛化能力比显式奖励模型（EX-RM）差，尤其是在分布外的情况下，为了从根本上理解不同奖励模型类型中潜在的内隐偏差，我们对这种差距的根本原因进行了调查。

Method: 通过理论和实验相结合的方法，研究了不同奖励模型类型中潜在的内隐偏差的根本原因。

Result: IM-RM 更多地依赖于表面的token级别线索，因此，在token级别分布变化以及分布内的情况下，它们的泛化能力通常比 EX-RM 差。我们还提供了证据来反驳对泛化差距的替代假设。最值得注意的是，我们挑战了一个直观的观点，即 IM-RM 在生成比验证更难的任务中表现不佳，因为它们既可以作为验证器也可以作为生成器。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使是很小的设计选择也会对奖励模型的泛化能力产生很大的影响。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 确保透明和可信赖的推理至关重要。然而，现有的LLMs医学推理能力评估策略要么评估结果不令人满意，要么可扩展性差，并且仍然缺乏严格的基准。

Method: 我们提出了LLM-w-Ref，这是一个新颖的评估框架，它利用细粒度的基本原理和LLM-as-a-Judge机制来评估具有专家级别保真度的中间推理，同时保持可扩展性。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断表现出很强的正相关性。对十二个最先进的LLM进行基准测试，我们发现较小的模型（例如，MedGemma-27B）可以超过较大的专有模型（例如，OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench提供了一个评估LLMs医学推理的基础工具，以促进其在临床实践中的安全和负责任的部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just

Motivation: 现有方法未解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择的问题，提及文本上下文缺乏语义内容，且未能区分模态信息不同部分的重要性。

Method: 提出了一个多层次混合专家(MMoE)模型，包含描述感知提及增强模块、多模态特征提取模块、层内混合专家模块和层间混合专家模块。

Result: 大量实验证明MMoE的性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MMoE在多模态实体链接任务上表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called CoPT for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. It leverages domain-agnostic text embeddings generated by an LLM to learn domain-invariant features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text.

Method: a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined.

Result: achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation on four benchmarks

Conclusion: a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generative capability of image generation models has raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. Machine unlearning emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models, but the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.

Method: This paper proposes Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image.

Result: Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt.

Conclusion: This paper reveals critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

Conclusion: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of XAI methods in biomedical image analysis, including a modality-centered taxonomy, discussion of multimodal learning and vision-language models, evaluation metrics, and open challenges.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal

survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Motivation: This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations.

Method: Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict.

Result: The reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance.

Conclusion: This paper provides insights into the robustness of MLLMs by shedding light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Motivation: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat detection.

Result: The proposed method can detect and localize target vessels using only on-board vision in GNSS-denied environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method was demonstrated in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. The impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision was evaluated and compared with the oracle approach.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的脑电图视觉解码模型，该模型通过将脑电信号与多层次语义字幕对齐，绕过了直接的脑电图到图像生成，并在EEGCVPR数据集上取得了优异的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从脑信号中解码视觉体验为神经科学和可解释的人工智能提供了令人兴奋的可能性。脑电图虽然易于获取且时间精确，但其在空间细节上的限制阻碍了图像重建。

Method: 该模型采用基于Transformer的脑电图编码器，通过对比学习将脑电活动映射到由大型语言模型生成的多层次语义字幕，然后利用投影头检索字幕嵌入，调节预训练的潜在扩散模型进行图像生成。

Result: 该模型在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码，并与已知的神经认知通路实现了可解释的对齐。显著性图和t-SNE投影揭示了头皮上的语义地形。

Conclusion: 该模型通过结构化的语义中介，实现了与认知对齐的脑电图视觉解码。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Motivation: existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity.

Method: We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities.

Result: key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities

Conclusion: We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CSCI, a color-based method for Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) that uses color information to improve performance without additional annotations or resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive, relying on additional models or annotations. This paper explores color as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias.

Method: The paper proposes Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that leverages color information and introduces S2A self-attention to disentangle color and identity cues.

Result: The paper improves the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID, achieving improvements on image and video ReID datasets without additional supervision.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal language-guided framework called DisenQ to disentangle biometrics features from motion and appearance variations for activity-based person identification, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying individuals across diverse sets of activities is challenging because identity cues become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations. Additional visual data like pose and/or silhouette often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.

Method: We introduce DisenQ (Disentangling Q-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured language guidance.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization to complex real-world scenarios with competitive performance on a traditional video-based identification benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal language-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization to complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMM）通常在大量的图像-文本数据上进行训练，但在语言覆盖范围方面往往受到限制，导致跨语言的偏差和不公平输出。先前的研究探索了多模态评估，但较少强调评估多语言能力。

Method: 引入LinguaMark，一个旨在评估最先进LMM在多语言视觉问答（VQA）任务上的基准。

Result: 闭源模型通常获得最高的整体性能。闭源模型（GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）和开源模型（Gemma3，Qwen2.5）在社会属性方面表现出竞争力，并且Qwen2.5在多种语言中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 闭源模型通常表现最佳，Qwen2.5在多种语言中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Motivation: It's unclear whether vision-language models perform grounded visual reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and biases.

Method: Introduction of MagiC benchmark with weakly supervised and human-curated QA examples. Evaluation of 15 vision-language models across four dimensions.

Result: Evaluation of 15 models, new metrics (MagiScore, StepSense), and analyses revealing limitations and opportunities.

Conclusion: MagiC reveals limitations in current visual reasoning approaches, offering opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动创建数据集的方法，用于训练指令引导图像编辑评估的评分模型。该评分器优于其他模型，可作为奖励模型，并提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令引导图像编辑的最新进展强调了有效自动评估的必要性。虽然视觉-语言模型（VLM）已被用作评估器，但开源模型在对齐方面存在困难，而专有模型缺乏透明度和成本效益。此外，没有公开的训练数据集来微调开源VLM，只有具有不同评估方案的小型基准。

Method: 提出了一种自动数据集创建方法ADIEE，用于训练指令引导图像编辑评估的评分模型。使用该方法生成了一个包含超过10万个样本的大规模数据集，并用它来微调一个修改后的LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型，该模型被修改为从自定义令牌中解码一个数值分数。

Result: 所提出的评分器可以作为奖励模型，从而实现自动最佳编辑选择和模型微调。值得注意的是，所提出的评分器可以将MagicBrush模型在ImagenHub上的平均评估分数从5.90提高到6.43（+8.98%）。

Conclusion: 提出的评分器在所有基准测试中都优于所有开源VLM和Gemini-Pro 1.5，并在AURORA-Bench上实现了与人类评分相关性0.0696（+17.24%）的提升，在GenAI-Bench上实现了4.03%（+7.21%）的成对比较准确率提升，在AURORA-Bench上实现了4.75%（+9.35%）的成对比较准确率提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种对比强化学习方法，以提高视觉故事讲述系统中角色和对象身份保持的一致性，并通过实验验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉故事讲述系统，特别是大型视觉语言模型，难以在不同帧中保持角色和对象身份，通常无法识别不同图像中的实体何时代表相同的个人或对象，从而导致不一致的引用和指代幻觉。发生这种情况是因为模型缺乏关于何时在帧之间建立实体连接的明确训练。

Method: 提出了一种对比强化学习方法，该方法训练模型来区分连贯的图像序列和来自不相关图像的故事。使用双分量奖励函数的直接偏好优化，该函数促进真实故事中实体的 grounding 和重新识别，同时惩罚合成上下文中不正确的实体连接。

Result: grounding mAP 从 0.27 提高到 0.31 (+14.8%)，F1 从 0.35 提高到 0.41 (+17.1%)。代词 grounding 准确率在除“its”之外的所有代词类型上都有所提高，并且跨帧角色和对象持久性在所有帧计数上都有所提高，出现在 5 个或更多帧中的实体从 29.3% 提高到 33.3% (+13.7%)。包含思维链和 grounding 故事的结构良好的故事从 79.1% 增加到 97.5% (+23.3%)。

Conclusion: 通过对比学习框架，对Qwen Storyteller（基于Qwen2.5-VL 7B）进行了微调，实验结果表明，在 grounding mAP、F1、代词 grounding 准确率、跨帧角色和对象持久性以及结构良好的故事方面均有提高。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

TL;DR: This paper improves particle-based shape modeling by introducing mechanisms for better surface adaptivity and consistent particle configurations, evaluated on anatomical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent particle-based shape modeling methods lack self-adaptivity, which is essential for accurately representing complex anatomical variability.

Method: introducing a novel neighborhood correspondence loss and a geodesic correspondence algorithm

Result: The approach's efficacy and scalability are evaluated on challenging datasets, providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and correspondence metrics.

Conclusion: This paper introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. The approach is evaluated on challenging datasets, with analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Conclusion: MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Method: 提出了一个新颖的习惯保持运动转移框架，该框架具有类别特定的习惯编码器，允许它学习捕获独特习惯特征的运动先验。

Result: 引入了 DeformingThings4D-skl 数据集，这是一个带有骨骼绑定的四足动物数据集，并进行了广泛的实验和定量分析，验证了我们提出的模型的优越性。

Conclusion: 该模型优于现有模型。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing

Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Motivation: 在室外环境中智能闭路电视系统日益普及，对针对具有挑战性的天气条件优化的面部识别系统的需求不断增长。不利的天气会显着降低图像质量，从而降低识别准确率。尽管最近基于生成对抗网络 (GAN) 和扩散模型的面部图像恢复 (FIR) 模型已显示出进展，但由于缺乏专门针对天气引起的退化的专用模块，它们的性能仍然有限，这会导致面部纹理和结构失真。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method, Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), to protect private video data used in visual object tracking (VOT) from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. It outperforms existing methods and shows strong transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks, directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability.

Method: This paper proposes a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and introduces a temporal contrastive loss to enhance the effectiveness of TUEs.

Result: The trackers trained with TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work often overlooks the association of global SD maps with online HD maps for hybrid navigation, hindering the utilization of online HD maps in the real world.

Method: A Map Association Transformer framework using path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: OMA benchmark containing 480k roads and 260k lane paths with corresponding evaluation metrics. A Map Association Transformer framework is proposed as the baseline method.

Conclusion: The paper introduces OMA, a benchmark for hybrid navigation-oriented online map association, and proposes a Map Association Transformer framework as a baseline method.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence

Result: diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across all evaluation datasets

Conclusion: DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network, is proposed to model human motion, leveraging dynamics and kinematics priors for improved short-term motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods typically represent the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions.

Method: The paper proposes GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human topology in groups. A novel radial field is proposed for the graph network to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed. Equivariant MLPs update joint position features. An auxiliary loss is introduced to supervise motion priors during training.

Result: GGMotion achieves a significant performance margin in short-term motion prediction on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GGMotion model achieves superior performance in short-term motion prediction on three standard benchmarks: Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的多视角视频数据集MUVOD，用于训练和评估重建的真实场景中的物体分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于神经辐射场（NeRF）和3D高斯溅射（3D GS）的方法在静态场景中的3D物体分割领域中稳步普及。然而，由于缺乏足够广泛和准确标记的多视角视频数据集，动态场景的4D物体分割仍然是一个未被充分探索的领域。

Method: 收集了来自不同类型的相机设备的各种室内或室外活动的17个场景。

Result: 包含来自73个类别的459个实例。它包含7830张RGB图像（每个视频30帧），以及它们在4D运动中对应的分割掩模。

Conclusion: 提出了一个名为MUVOD的多视角视频数据集，并用它来评估多视角视频分割方法。还提出了一个评估指标和一个基线分割方法。另外，还提出了一个新的3D物体分割任务的基准。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于样条的轨迹表示和低秩时变空间编码方法，用于解决密集点轨迹建模中的空间连贯性和时间插值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集点轨迹建模通常采用隐式变形场，表示为将坐标映射到时间偏移以关联规范空间位置的神经网络。然而，神经网络中固有的归纳偏差会阻碍在不适定情况下的空间连贯性。当前的方法侧重于增强变形场的编码策略，但通常导致不透明和不太直观的模型，或者采用显式技术，如线性混合蒙皮，这依赖于基于启发式的结点初始化。此外，隐式表示在插值稀疏时间信号方面的潜力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种基于样条的轨迹表示，其中结点的数量明确地决定了自由度。为了在空间和时间域中对结点特性进行建模，我们引入了一种新的低秩时变空间编码，取代了传统的耦合时空技术。

Result: 该方法在时间插值方面表现出优越的性能，用于拟合具有稀疏输入的连续场。此外，它实现了与最先进方法相比具有竞争力的动态场景重建质量，同时增强了运动连贯性，而无需依赖线性混合蒙皮或尽可能刚性的约束。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏输入下，对连续场的时间插值表现出优越的性能。此外，与最先进的方法相比，该方法实现了具有竞争力的动态场景重建质量，同时增强了运动连贯性，且不依赖于线性混合蒙皮或尽可能刚性的约束。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX is a multi-modal remote sensing foundation model that addresses the modality mismatch and high fine-tuning costs of existing models by using a mixture-of-modality experts and modality-aware pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing foundation models often focus on specific modalities, creating a mismatch with application modalities, and their large size makes fine-tuning expensive.

Method: MAPEX, a remote sensing foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts, pre-trained on multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing mechanism and a modality aware pruning technique.

Result: MAPEX yields efficient modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the modalities of interest.

Conclusion: MAPEX achieves strong performance on diverse remote sensing datasets compared to fully supervised training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

TL;DR: VLMs are limited by the linear separability of their visual embeddings. This work finds this bottleneck stems from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways and demonstrates this is a solvable alignment issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.

Method: Introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings.

Result: The linear reasoning bottleneck is widespread and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways. Activating existing pathways suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs is a matter of targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

TL;DR: DGKD-WLSS解决了弱监督低光语义分割中图像质量下降和弱监督约束的问题，通过结合DGKD和DGF2实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在光线充足的场景中取得了显著进展，但由于两个根本限制，它们在低光环境中的性能显著下降：严重的图像质量下降（例如，低对比度、噪声和颜色失真）和弱监督的固有约束。这些因素共同导致不可靠的类激活图和语义模糊的伪标签，最终损害了模型学习区分性特征表示的能力。

Method: 结合了Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) 和 Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2)。DGKD通过基于扩散的去噪和知识蒸馏对齐正常光和低光特征，而DGF2集成了深度图作为光照不变的几何先验，以增强结构特征学习。

Result: DGKD-WLSS在弱监督低光语义分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS在弱监督低光语义分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection
framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect

Motivation: 现有的产品通常以空间细节换取覆盖范围，或者完全忽略洪水深度。为了弥合这一差距。

Method: HOTA：分层重叠平铺聚合，一种即插即用的多尺度推理策略。结合SegFormer和一个双约束深度估计模块，形成一个完整的3D洪水映射管道。

Result: HOTA与SegFormer结合使用，将IoU从73%（U-Net基线）提高到84%。由此产生的3D表面实现了小于0.5米的平均绝对边界误差。

Conclusion: HOTA可以生成精确的大面积3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for hair transfer lack the ability to generate consistent and high-quality multi-view outputs.

Method: A multi-view diffusion model with polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal attention layers, trained with a multi-stage strategy.

Result: The method achieves accurate, detailed, realistic, seamless, and consistent hair transfer across multiple views, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Stable-Hair v2, a multi-view hair transfer framework that outperforms existing methods and sets a new benchmark.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench是一个用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在空间可视化方面能力的基准，它揭示了现有模型在这方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）支持基于想象的推理，但空间可视化仍然没有得到充分的评估，通常嵌入在更广泛的数学和逻辑评估中。现有的评估通常依赖于可能与训练数据重叠的智商测试或数学竞赛，从而损害了评估的可靠性。

Method: 引入SpatialViz-Bench，这是一个综合性的多模态基准，用于空间可视化，包含12个任务，跨越4个子能力，包含1180个自动生成的问题。

Result: 对33个最先进的MLLM的评估不仅揭示了广泛的性能差异，并证明了该基准的强大区分能力，而且还发现了违反直觉的发现：模型表现出意想不到的行为，表现出与人类直觉不符的困难感知，显示出戏剧性的2D到3D性能悬崖，并且尽管空间任务只需要可视化，但默认采用公式推导。

Conclusion: 最先进的MLLM在空间可视化任务中仍然表现出不足，填补了该领域的一个重大空白。该基准是公开可用的。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

TL;DR: ViLU是一种新的视觉-语言不确定性量化框架，它通过利用所有任务相关的文本表示来对不确定性估计进行情境化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)的可靠不确定性量化(UQ)和失败预测仍然是开放的挑战。

Method: ViLU通过交叉注意力整合视觉嵌入、预测的文本嵌入和图像条件文本表示，构建了一个不确定性感知多模态表示。不同于传统的基于损失预测的UQ方法，ViLU训练一个不确定性预测器作为二元分类器，以区分正确和不正确的预测，使用加权二元交叉熵损失，使其与损失无关。

Result: 在各种数据集上的大量实验表明，与最先进的失败预测方法相比，我们的方法获得了显著的收益。我们将我们的方法应用于标准分类数据集(如ImageNet-1k)以及大规模图像字幕数据集(如CC12M和LAION-400M)。

Conclusion: ViLU在各种数据集上都表现出显著的优势，并且消融研究突出了其架构和训练在实现有效不确定性量化方面的关键作用。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

TL;DR: 提出了一种轨迹引导的生成视频编码框架(T-GVC)，它采用语义感知的稀疏运动采样管道，有效地将低层次的运动跟踪与高层次的语义理解联系起来, 解决了现有方法无法捕捉运动细节的问题，并在ULB条件下表现出色。

Motivation: 现有的方法受到领域特异性或过度依赖高级文本指导的限制，这通常不能捕捉运动细节，导致不真实的重建。

Method: 提出了一种轨迹引导的生成视频编码框架(T-GVC)，它采用语义感知的稀疏运动采样管道，通过提取像素级的运动作为稀疏轨迹点，有效地将低层次的运动跟踪与高层次的语义理解联系起来，并结合轨迹对齐的损失约束到扩散过程中，引入了一种免训练的潜在空间引导机制。

Result: 该框架在ULB条件下优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法，并在运动控制方面优于现有的文本引导方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在ULB条件下优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法，并在运动控制方面优于现有的文本引导方法，为几何运动建模引导的生成视频编码开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies and mitigates age-related bias in deep FER models, particularly for elderly individuals, using methods like Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. The results show improved accuracy and more relevant facial region attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems often exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can compromise their fairness and reliability.

Method: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss

Result: Consistent improvements in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

TL;DR: MolCLIP是一种结合显微细胞视频和分子模态的视觉语言模型，通过分子辅助CLIP框架和度量学习策略，在药物识别和MoA识别方面取得了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了活细胞的时间动态，且药物分子可以触发与特定MoA相关的细胞动态变化。药物分子模态可能补充图像对应部分。

Method: MolCLIP设计了一个分子辅助CLIP框架，以指导视频特征学习分子潜在空间分布，并整合了一个度量学习策略来优化视频特征的聚合。

Result: 在MitoDataset上的实验结果表明，MolCLIP在药物识别和MoA识别方面取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: MolCLIP在药物识别和MoA识别方面分别实现了51.2%和20.5%的mAP改进。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of growth potential in pediatric orthodontics is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Manual annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae is labor-intensive.

Method: The study introduces Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model, to streamline the annotation process of keypoints on cervical vertebrae from lateral cephalometric radiographs. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network and a morphology-aware loss function.

Result: ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging. It substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process.

Conclusion: This research offers an effective AI-assisted diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AU-DFER, an architecture that incorporates Action Unit (AU) knowledge into deep learning for dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER). It outperforms existing methods and addresses data imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DFER research has concentrated on feature learning from a deep learning perspective. This paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling by incorporating AU-expression knowledge.

Method: An AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture (AU-DFER) is proposed, incorporating AU-expression knowledge to enhance deep learning modeling. A weight matrix is designed to incorporate a priori knowledge, and AU loss is introduced to integrate knowledge with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network.

Result: Experiments on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The AU loss function redesign also addresses data label imbalance issues.

Conclusion: The proposed AU-DFER architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) without additional computation, and a diverse loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER by addressing data imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces RED, a decoding strategy that improves the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs by harmonizing visual and rationale information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning.

Method: The authors propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy that harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions.

Result: Experiments show that RED improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs.

Conclusion: RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. The work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tree-Mamba, a tree-aware Mamba method, and BlueDepth, a new underwater depth estimation benchmark, to improve underwater monocular depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba-based methods struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images effectively. Existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater images and their corresponding depth maps.

Method: A novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, is developed for estimating accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. A tree-aware scanning strategy is proposed that adaptively constructs a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and top-down traversals.

Result: An underwater depth estimation benchmark (called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with reliable depth labels, is constructed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Tree-Mamba method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control.

Method: A unified agentic framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control, using Finite State Machines (FSMs) as interpretable operating envelopes.

Result: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path success within five reprompts in Case Study 1. In Case Study 2, the LLM-based controller attains similar performance to classical PID control.

Conclusion: LLMs with structured feedback and modular agents can unify high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control, enabling resilient, language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BOOST, a new method to reduce bias in AI art classification by adaptively sampling data and tuning temperature scaling, achieving better fairness and performance on biased datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the significant challenge of bias in AI painting classification, which arises from imbalanced datasets and compromises the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, especially when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

Method: The paper proposes an OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method called BOOST, which dynamically adjusts temperature scaling and sampling probabilities.

Result: The proposed BOOST method demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain. The paper also introduces a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), to assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction.

Conclusion: The paper introduces BOOST, a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method, and demonstrates its effectiveness in balancing performance and fairness in AI models for art classification, as validated on the KaoKore and PACS datasets.

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

### [109] [Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217)
*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uses neurosymbolic methods and a question tree approach to detect illicit activities in supply chains, addressing the challenge of sparse and unreliable data by comparing human and machine classification of news articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However, illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal data, without requiring large training data sets.

Method: We explore neurosymbolic methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities.

Conclusion: We propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Motivation: Automating scientific research tasks.

Method: A multi-agent system with a Planning & Control strategy orchestrates 30 LLM agents, each specializing in a different task.

Result: Successful application of cmbagent to a PhD-level cosmology task and superior performance on two benchmark sets.

Conclusion: The cmbagent system demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs on benchmark sets and successfully carries out a PhD-level cosmology task.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的翻译agent通常仅限于纯文本输入。本文介绍了一种为多模态输入设计的翻译agent系统ViDove。

Method: ViDove利用视觉和上下文背景信息来增强翻译过程，并整合了多模态记忆系统和富含领域知识的长短期记忆模块。

Result: ViDove的翻译质量显著提高，并在长格式自动视频字幕和翻译方面引入了一个新的基准DoveBench。

Conclusion: ViDove在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中取得了显著更高的翻译质量，BLEU scores 提高了 28%，SubER 提高了 15%。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concern about the potential misuse of large language models (LLMs) for generating harmful content.

Method: Computational analysis and cryptographic hardness assumptions.

Result: Demonstrates computational challenges in filtering both prompts and outputs. There exist LLMs for which there are no efficient prompt filters. Output filtering is computationally intractable in a natural setting.

Conclusion: Safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals; in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not suffice. An aligned AI system's intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec 显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or

computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that

Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by

Conclusion: StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network

generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two

Motivation: Evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in LLMs. The benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and topological reasoning but also interior design constraints.

Result: Models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under layout perturbation.

Conclusion: LLMs do not consistently reason about real-world layouts.

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and

structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,

benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite DPO's empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. DPO is highly sensitive to initialization and tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences.

Method: A theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization. Introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics.

Result: Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that the method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO.

Conclusion: Stable preference optimization consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO, and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

### [124] [Identification of Violin Reduction via Contour Lines Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07743)
*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or non-reduced based on their contour lines, and finds that distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, and also find the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e. lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.

Method: We study a corpus of 25 instruments whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre. Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y = alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta) and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument. We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can predict size reduction.

Result: distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree

Conclusion: Distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.

lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

TL;DR: FAI 基准是一个评估 AI 与人类发展一致性的新框架，它揭示了现有模型在某些关键维度上的不足，并为开发积极支持人类发展的 AI 系统奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准侧重于技术能力或避免伤害，而 FAI 基准衡量 AI 模型在多大程度上促进个人在七个维度上的发展。

Method: 该基准通过包含 1,229 个客观和主观问题的综合方法，评估 LLM AI 系统与当前整体人类福祉研究模型的对齐程度。使用专门的判断 LLM 和跨维度评估，FAI 基准采用几何平均评分，以确保所有发展维度的平衡表现。

Result: 对 28 个领先语言模型的初步测试表明，虽然某些模型接近整体对齐（得分最高的模型达到 72/100），但没有一个模型在所有维度上都能被接受地对齐，尤其是在信仰与灵性、品格与美德以及意义与目标方面。

Conclusion: 当前领先的语言模型在各个维度上与人类的全面发展并不完全一致，尤其是在信仰与灵性、品格与美德以及意义与目标方面。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoSE, a skill-oriented MoE model for autonomous driving that learns skill-by-skill and step-by-step, achieving better performance with fewer activated parameters compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization. The paper is inspired by the learning process of human drivers to address these challenges in end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper proposes a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model (MoSE) with a skill-oriented routing mechanism and a hierarchical skill dataset to mimic human drivers' learning and reasoning process.

Result: The MoSE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CODA AD corner case reasoning task with a significantly reduced activated model size (at least by 62.5%) compared to existing methods, using a single-turn conversation.

Conclusion: The proposed MoSE model outperforms several 8B+ parameter models on the CODA AD corner case reasoning task with less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Motivation: 当前的人工智能发展主要依赖于扩展神经模型和训练数据集来实现泛化和鲁棒性，但这会带来显著的环境、经济和伦理成本，限制了可持续性和公平的可访问性。受生物感觉系统的启发，我们提倡自适应感知作为一种必要的和基础性的转变。

Method: 通过在输入端主动调整传感器参数（例如，曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置）来缓解协变量偏移并提高效率。

Result: 来自最近研究的经验证据表明，自适应感知使小型模型（例如，EfficientNet-B0）能够超越使用更多数据和计算训练的更大的模型（例如，OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 自适应感知可以帮助人工智能社区过渡到可持续、稳健和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Motivation: 传统的XAI和因果关系文献侧重于理解哪些因素导致哪些结果。然而，这些知识对研究人员和工程师有价值，但不是非专业用户期望的解释。相反，这些用户通常等待导致目标结果的事实，即实际原因。形式化这个概念仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。此外，据报道，识别实际原因是一个NP完全问题，并且太少的实际解决方案来近似正式定义。

Result: 这些算法能够识别现有方法无法处理的不同类别的系统的原因（即，非布尔、黑盒和随机系统），（2）可以调整以获得更高的精度和完备性，并花费更多的计算时间。

Conclusion: 提出了一组算法，用于识别具有多项式复杂度和可调整的精度和完备性水平的实际原因。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Motivation: 过去十年，少数公司的AI系统实现了令人难以置信的扩展，导致AI模型性能的不平衡。本文认为，与普遍的直觉相反，计算扩展的收益递减将导致AI模型能力的趋同。

Method: 我们建立了一个模型，说明在固定分布的下一个token目标下，原始计算的边际能力收益会大幅缩小。此外，我们还分析了人工智能模型在一段时间内的能力差异的经验数据。

Result: 在当前的模型扩展实践下，即使那些扩展模型速度比其他组织快得多的公司，最终在能力方面也不会有什么优势。作为论证的一部分，我们给出了几个理由，即像训练损失差异这样的代理指标，可以使用基准数据和理论性能模型的证据来捕捉重要的能力指标。

Conclusion: 随着小模型的性能提升，AI策略和政策需要重新审视，并概述了这种转变将影响的领域。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Conclusion: AI 适用性评分最高的职业群体是计算机、数学以及办公室和行政支持等知识工作职业群体，以及销售等工作活动涉及提供和交流信息的职业。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Motivation: 学习型基数估计器在查询基数预测中显示出前景，但它们普遍表现出对训练数据漂移的脆弱性，从而给实际部署带来风险。这项工作首次从理论上研究了最小的数据级漂移如何最大限度地降低学习型估计器的准确性。

Method: 提出了针对黑盒环境中学习型估计器的数据中心算法复杂性攻击，并证明了找到最佳攻击策略是 NP-Hard 问题。设计了一种具有 (1-κ) 近似比的多项式时间近似算法。

Result: 在 STATS-CEB 和 IMDB-JOB 基准测试中，仅修改 0.8% 的训练元组，就使第 90 个百分位的 Qerror 增加了三个数量级，并使端到端处理时间增加了 20 倍。

Conclusion: 揭示了已部署的学习型估计器的关键漏洞，并首次统一分析了数据更新下其脆弱性的最坏情况理论，同时确定了两种缓解此类黑盒攻击的对策，为开发稳健的学习型数据库优化器提供了见解。

Abstract: Learned cardinality estimators show promise in query cardinality prediction,
yet they universally exhibit fragility to training data drifts, posing risks
for real-world deployment. This work is the first to theoretical investigate
how minimal data-level drifts can maximally degrade the accuracy of learned
estimators. We propose data-centric algorithmic complexity attacks against
learned estimators in a black-box setting, proving that finding the optimal
attack strategy is NP-Hard. To address this, we design a polynomial-time
approximation algorithm with a $(1-\kappa)$ approximation ratio. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our attack's effectiveness: on STATS-CEB and IMDB-JOB
benchmarks, modifying just 0.8\% of training tuples increases the 90th
percentile Qerror by three orders of magnitude and raises end-to-end processing
time by up to 20$\times$. Our work not only reveals critical vulnerabilities in
deployed learned estimators but also provides the first unified worst-case
theoretical analysis of their fragility under data updates. Additionally, we
identify two countermeasures to mitigate such black-box attacks, offering
insights for developing robust learned database optimizers.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inherently limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned optimizers.

Method: Introduce JOB-Complex, a new benchmark designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting real-world complexity. Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution plans

Result: Traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal plans.

Conclusion: Traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal plans.

Abstract: Query optimization is a fundamental task in database systems that is crucial
to providing high performance. To evaluate learned and traditional optimizer's
performance, several benchmarks, such as the widely used JOB benchmark, are
used. However, in this paper, we argue that existing benchmarks are inherently
limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query
optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned
optimizers. In fact, simple but realistic properties, such as joins over string
columns or complex filter predicates, can drastically reduce the performance of
existing query optimizers. Thus, we introduce JOB-Complex, a new benchmark
designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting
real-world complexity. Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes
together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution
plans, making it a valuable resource to evaluate the performance of query
optimizers and cost models in real-world scenarios. In our evaluation, we show
that traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance
on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal
plans.

Abstract: Dataspaces are designed to support sovereign, trusted and decentralized data
exchange between participants forming an ecosystem. They are standardized by
initiatives such as the International Data Spaces Association or Gaia-X and
have gained adoption in several domains such as mobility, manufacturing,
tourism or culture. In dataspaces, participants use connectors to communicate
peer-to-peer. The Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) Connector is a broadly
adopted, open-source implementation that adheres to the standards and is
supported by a large community. As dataspaces in general, it focuses on the
exchange of data assets with associated usage policies and does not support
services. In practice, however, there is demand for dataspace-based services
and conceptual arguments support their inclusion in dataspaces. In this paper,
we propose an abstraction layer for providing generic services within
dataspaces. Adopters can use this layer to easily develop own services,
seamlessly integrated with the existing dataspace technology. Besides, we
present an initial implementation of this service architecture for the EDC
Connector and demonstrate its practical applicability.

*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-enhanced movie recommendation framework that outperforms traditional methods by incorporating natural language user preferences, but with increased computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation algorithms lack the ability to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences expressed in natural language.

Method: The study uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or SVD++ algorithms for initial recommendations, enhanced with LLMs to incorporate language-based user preferences. Implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset.

Result: The LLM-enhanced framework significantly surpasses SVD and SVD++ in performance, with improvements of up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate and ~3.7x in NDCG. However, this comes at the cost of a slight increase in computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-enhanced framework significantly outperforms traditional SVD and SVD++ algorithms in movie recommendation, achieving substantial improvements in various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: integration of GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks

Method: a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies spectral smoothness

Result: GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks

Conclusion: GCL-based recommendation models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated substantial promise in
enhancing the robustness and generalization of recommender systems,
particularly by enabling models to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for
improved representation learning. However, in this paper, we reveal an
unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the
susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both
theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause
as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which
disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally
enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce
CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies
spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility
of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further
propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to
accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model
performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation
models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM
effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 现有的GCL方法依赖于增强技术，这些技术引入了语义上不相关的噪声，并导致大量的计算和存储成本，限制了有效性和效率。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明NLGCL优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: NLGCL在效果和效率上优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in collaborative filtering to
capture high-order user-item relationships. To address the data sparsity
problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged
as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive
views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that
introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and
storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning
framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers
within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as
positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based
noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view
construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for
real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and
efficiency.

Motivation: 由于位置偏差，用户的点击存在固有的偏差，即用户更有可能点击排名较高的文档，而不是排名较低的文档。为了解决训练 LTR 模型时的这种偏差，文献中的许多方法都使用逆倾向评分 (IPS) 重新加权用户的点击数据。

Method: 提出了一种 IPS 的扩展，称为 IPSsim，它在估计 IPS 时考虑了文档的相似性。

Result: 在两个大型公开可用的 LTR 数据集上，在许多模拟用户点击设置下，以及在不同数量的训练点击下，评估了 IPSsim 估计器。实验表明，IPSsim 估计器在学习无偏 LTR 模型方面比现有的 IPS 估计器更有效，尤其是在 n >= 30 的 top-n 设置中。当 n = 50 时，IPSsim 估计器在 NDCG 方面实现了具有统计显着性的约 3% 的改进（p < 0.05），与文献中的 Doubly Robust 估计器相比。

Conclusion: IPSsim 估计器在学习无偏 LTR 模型方面比现有的 IPS 估计器更有效，尤其是在 n >= 30 的 top-n 设置中。例如，当 n = 50 时，我们的 IPSsim 估计器在 NDCG 方面实现了具有统计显着性的约 3% 的改进（p < 0.05），与文献中的 Doubly Robust 估计器相比。

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) models learn from historical user interactions, such
as user clicks. However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due
to position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents
than low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many
approaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse
Propensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to
the position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was
clicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In
this paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to
highly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,
accounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant
documents when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of
position bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that
takes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We
evaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets
under a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of
training clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more
effective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model,
particularly in top-n settings when n >= 30. For example, when n = 50, our
IPSsim estimator achieves a statistically significant ~3% improvement (p <
0.05) in terms of NDCG compared to the Doubly Robust estimator from the
literature.

### [139] [Measuring Hypothesis Testing Errors in the Evaluation of Retrieval Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07924)
*Jack McKechnie,Graham McDonald,Craig Macdonald*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper argues that identifying Type II errors is important for evaluating the discriminative power of qrels in Information Retrieval (IR) systems. The authors propose using balanced classification metrics to portray the discriminative power of qrels and find that quantifying Type II errors provides additional insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring large volumes of human relevance assessments is expensive. Therefore, more efficient relevance assessment approaches have been proposed, necessitating comparisons between qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as they lead science in the wrong direction.

Method: Experiments using qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation.

Result: Additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying Type II errors, and that balanced classification metrics can be used to give an overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.

Conclusion: Quantifying Type II errors provides additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels, and balanced classification metrics can be used to give an overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.

Abstract: The evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems typically uses
query-document pairs with corresponding human-labelled relevance assessments
(qrels). These qrels are used to determine if one system is better than another
based on average retrieval performance. Acquiring large volumes of human
relevance assessments is expensive. Therefore, more efficient relevance
assessment approaches have been proposed, necessitating comparisons between
qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Discriminative power, i.e. the ability to
correctly identify significant differences between systems, is important for
drawing accurate conclusions on the robustness of qrels. Previous work has
measured the proportion of pairs of systems that are identified as
significantly different and has quantified Type I statistical errors. Type I
errors lead to incorrect conclusions due to false positive significance tests.
We argue that also identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as
they lead science in the wrong direction. We quantify Type II errors and
propose that balanced classification metrics, such as balanced accuracy, can be
used to portray the discriminative power of qrels. We perform experiments using
qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate
measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation. We find that additional
insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying
Type II errors, and that balanced classification metrics can be used to give an
overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.

Motivation: 标签偏差是现代组织系统中的一个重要数据完整性挑战，指的是标签中的系统性错误，这种偏差在社会群体中存在差异。有效的解决方法仍然稀缺。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，名为解耦置信学习(DeCoLe)，专门用于检测受标签偏差影响的数据集中错误标记的实例。

Result: DeCoLe在偏差感知的错误标记检测方面表现出色，始终优于其他标签错误检测方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种名为解耦置信学习(DeCoLe)的框架，用于检测受标签偏差影响的数据集中错误标记的实例，从而实现偏差感知的错误标记检测，并促进数据质量的提高。实证结果表明，DeCoLe在偏差感知的错误标记检测方面表现出色，始终优于其他标签错误检测方法。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

### [141] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a constructive approach to scaling LLMs using fixed representational substrate, enabling modular composition and progressive layer-wise growth, leading to resource-efficient scaling and continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility.

Method: The paper introduces two scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition by averaging output logits of specialist models, and progressive layer-wise growth by stacking and training one layer at a time.

Result: Specialist models trained on disparate datasets can be merged into a single, more capable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural modification, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic forgetting. Layer-wise constructive training demonstrates stable convergence and a clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: This paper suggests a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized ecosystem for building powerful AI systems.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

*François Gardères,Shizhe Chen,Camille-Sovanneary Gauthier,Jean Ponce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FACap, a large-scale fashion-domain CIR dataset, and a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2 to improve performance in fashion CIR, especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists.

Method:  introduce FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset and propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching.

Result: Experimental results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts

Conclusion: The combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 介绍了一种自动工具，该工具利用语言模型来评估扩散模型中的反学习，揭示了语言模型施加的附近概念的语义排序与反学习损害相关，并且可以通过合成对抗性提示有效地规避反学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从基础扩散模型中清除不需要的信息是一种很有前景的经济有效的方法。虽然反学习比在没有不需要的信息的情况下重新训练扩散模型成本低几个数量级，但要证明信息已从模型中完全删除可能具有挑战性且劳动强度大。此外，反学习会损害人们希望保留的周围概念的扩散模型性能，因此不清楚扩散模型是否仍然适合部署。

Method: 利用（视觉）语言模型来彻底评估扩散模型中的反学习。

Result: 语言模型对附近概念施加语义排序，这与反学习损害密切相关；语言模型通过合成对抗性提示有效地规避反学习。

Conclusion: 使用自动工具评估流行的扩散模型反学习方法，揭示了语言模型 (1) 强加了附近概念的语义排序，这些排序与反学习损害密切相关，并且 (2) 通过合成对抗性提示有效地规避了反学习。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP 是一种新颖的框架，它结合了基于 GNN 的节点编码和最短路径上的序列建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络 (GNN) 通常难以捕获对于准确链接预测至关重要的特定于链接的结构模式，因为它们以节点为中心的消息传递方案忽略了连接一对节点的子图结构。注入这种结构上下文的现有方法要么产生高计算成本，要么依赖于简单的启发式方法（例如，公共邻居计数），而这些方法无法对多跳依赖关系进行建模。

Method: SP4LP首先应用 GNN 来计算所有节点的表示，然后提取每对候选节点之间的最短路径，并使用序列模型处理生成的节点嵌入序列。

Result: SP4LP 能够以计算效率捕获富有表现力的多跳关系模式。

Conclusion: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。从理论上讲，SP4LP比标准消息传递 GNN 和几种最先进的结构特征方法更具表现力，从而将其确立为图中链接预测的通用且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器合并后，相比LoRA或完整模型合并，产生了更优越的分布内性能。对于所有考虑的方法而言，实现强大的保留性能仍然是一个挑战。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current GCL methods primarily focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes, which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a significant challenge.

Method: a novel framework called Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL). Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in effectively capturing this commonsense.

Result: Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods

Conclusion: Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的快速扩展提高了推理成本，并增加了大量的部署障碍。量化到8位或4位可以缓解这种情况，但低于3位的方法面临严重的精度、可扩展性和效率下降。

Method: 卷积码量化（CCQ），一种优化推理的量化方法，将LLM压缩到2.0-2.75位，同时最大限度地减少精度损失。它集成了硬件感知的位移编码和解码解决方案与卷积码、混合编码和代码集群，共同克服了精度-速度瓶颈。构建了一个无查找的编码空间，实现了代码簿和权重向量之间的线性映射，从而优化了推理性能。借鉴向量量化中的数据映射概念，最大限度地减少了模型在极低比特条件下的性能下降。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B

TL;DR: This paper presents G-Guard, a new defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs that uses a GNN-based input classifier and attention-aware augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, which are difficult to detect and mitigate.

Method: This paper introduces G-Guard, an attention-aware GNN-based input classifier that constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries and uses an attention-aware augmentation mechanism.

Result: G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: G-Guard outperforms existing methods in defending against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to

*Sua Lee,Kyubum Shin,Jung Ho Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) to improve VLM performance by directly distilling knowledge from LLMs into continuous prompts, achieving better results on 11 recognition datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that extract text-based descriptions from LLM to incorporate into prompts suffer from high variability and low reliability. The paper aims to enhance robustness to unseen and diverse data by supplementing the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision data.

Method: The paper proposes Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul), a novel method that directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts and adopts a description-free approach, representing prompts as continuous vectors for optimization. It also explores prompt weighting in a multi-prompt setting.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) method achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets by eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates and incorporating richer semantics into prompts.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

*Huibo Xu,Runlong Yu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM) to address the limitations of diffusion models in time series forecasting. CGFM learns from the errors of an auxiliary model and outperforms state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important.

Method: CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions.

Result: CGFM enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.

Conclusion: WSA在多个Atari游戏中获得了与端到端模型相当的性能。对该方法进行了泛化能力的研究，并分析了模型数量的缩放如何影响智能体在训练期间和训练后的性能。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Motivation: 现有的VAMPnet和DPNet等深度学习方法需要在目标计算过程中通过经验二阶矩矩阵上潜在的数值不稳定运算（如奇异值分解和矩阵求逆）进行反向传播，这会引入有偏差的梯度估计并阻碍扩展到大型系统。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种可扩展且概念简单的方法，用于学习随机动力系统的Koopman算子的前k个奇异函数。经验结果表明，学习到的奇异子空间对于特征分析和多步预测等下游任务是可靠且有效的。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs behave inconsistently, indicating uncertainty that needs quantification. Model diversity offers potential for more reliable uncertainty estimates through aggregation.

Method: MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), an information-theoretic method using Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs.

Result: Improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines on binary prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Aggregating outputs from well-calibrated subsets of LLMs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates, improved calibration, and predictive performance in binary prediction tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Result: 结果表明，具有优化内核实现的注意力机制（包括 Flash 注意力、局部敏感哈希 (LSH) 注意力、多头潜在注意力 (MLA)）实现了最佳能源效率。GPU 功率降低并不一定能减少能源消耗，因为训练时间也起着同等重要的作用。

Conclusion: 具有优化内核实现的注意力机制（包括 Flash 注意力、局部敏感哈希 (LSH) 注意力、多头潜在注意力 (MLA)）实现了最佳能源效率。GPU 功率降低并不一定能减少能源消耗，因为训练时间也起着同等重要的作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 中间特征泄漏会使分布式深度学习系统容易受到攻击，需要在设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. A major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing.

Method: We propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions.

Result: The proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs.

Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平均治疗效果 (ATE) 是因果推理中的一个基础指标，广泛用于评估随机对照试验 (RCT) 中干预的有效性。然而，在许多应用中（尤其是在医疗保健领域），这种静态总结无法捕捉到随剂量和时间变化的治疗效果的细微动态。

Method: 将 SemanticODE（一种用于可解释轨迹建模的最新框架）调整到因果环境中，其中治疗效果永远不会被直接观察到。该方法将轨迹形状的估计与临床相关属性（例如，最大值，拐点）的规范分离，支持领域先验、事后编辑和透明分析。

Result: 该方法产生准确、可解释和可编辑的治疗动态模型。

Conclusion: 该方法产生准确、可解释和可编辑的治疗动态模型，有助于严格的因果分析和实际决策。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the contribution of each feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature, is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model. However, permutation feature importance has been shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features.

Method: We develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation), a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings.

Result: our results show that the test can be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are unreliable.

Conclusion: The test can be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are unreliable.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through

be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

TL;DR: A VAE and Riemannian geometry framework addresses manifold learning challenges: estimating intrinsic dimension, constructing local coordinates, and learning mappings. It improves inverse problem solutions and uses intrinsic dimension to monitor model capacity during pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures, as suggested by the manifold hypothesis. Fully leveraging this requires dealing with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces.

Method: The framework uses a Mixture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. It estimates the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs.

Result: The approach enhances solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. The intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for monitoring model capacity during network pruning.

Conclusion: This work introduces a framework using a Mixture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Riemannian geometry tools to address challenges in estimating intrinsic dimension (ID), constructing local coordinates, and learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. It demonstrates enhanced solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by enforcing reconstructions on the learned manifold. The study also explores the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality, suggesting ID as an effective proxy for monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,

dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a DPVD-MARL algorithm for clustered federated learning to minimize training loss while considering device clustering, RB allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. The algorithm improves convergence rate and rewards compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay in a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design.

Method: A novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm

Result: The proposed DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence rate and ultimate accumulated rewards compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: The DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence rate by up to 20% and ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deceptive signal-assisted private split learning method using a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) to minimize information leakage to eavesdroppers while meeting energy consumption and delay constraints. The proposed method improves the convergence rate and reduces information leakage compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Motivation: To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to each model training device.

Method: a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA)

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Result: CVAE 后悔得分在识别隐秘对抗威胁方面明显优于传统的基于马氏距离的检测器。

Conclusion: 高级概率建模对于加强IDS针对基于自适应生成模型的网络入侵的能力至关重要。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

*Malikussaid,Hilal Hudan Nuha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper bridges the "plausibility-validity gap" in chemistry by fine-tuning a LLM with a dual-domain dataset, achieving improved chemical validity and synthesis feasibility, but still faces limitations in stereochemistry and knowledge cutoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry.

Method: We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure quality.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference hallucination.

Conclusion: This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also delineating critical areas for future improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policies trained via DRL often struggle to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters, and obtaining sufficient training data across diverse contexts can be impractical.

Result: The paper proves analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts.

Conclusion: The paper validates the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Motivation: PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively labeled points is known apriori to the learner.

Method: theoretical analysis

Conclusion: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU learning under a wider range of setups. We prove upper and lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and the unlabeled samples).

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and

Result: GO-CBED优于现有基线。

Conclusion: GO-CBED在各种因果推理和发现任务中始终优于现有的基线，尤其是在实验预算有限和复杂的因果机制下。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Motivation: 当前基于图的疾病分类方法检测患者特异性分子指纹，但缺乏对队列范围特征的一致性和理解，而这对于理解不同动脉粥样硬化轨迹中的致病表型至关重要。此外，理解患者亚型通常孤立地考虑临床特征相似性，而没有整合患者之间共享的致病相互依赖性。

Method: 开发了一种分层图神经网络框架，以利用患者的两种特征模式：队列环境中的临床特征和个体患者特有的分子数据。

Result: 在391名患者的主要临床数据集中，我们证明了临床特征与分子相互作用模式的这种异构对齐，已将亚临床动脉粥样硬化分类性能在各种基线上提高了高达13%的受试者工作特征曲线下面积（AUC）和20%的F1分数。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Motivation: RLHF 容易受到奖励黑客攻击，即策略利用奖励函数中的缺陷，而不是真正学习预期的行为。尽管已经做出了重大努力来减轻奖励黑客攻击，但它们主要集中在同分布情景中进行评估，其中奖励模型的训练和测试数据共享相同的分布。最先进的方法在更具挑战性的分布外 (OOD) 设置中表现不佳。高质量数据的有限可用性通常会导致多目标奖励函数性能不佳，这会对整体性能产生负面影响并成为瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一个统一的奖励建模框架，该框架使用共享嵌入空间联合训练 Bradley--Terry (BT) 单目标和多目标基于回归的奖励函数。

Result: 回归任务增强了单目标奖励函数在具有挑战性的 OOD 设置中减轻奖励黑客攻击的能力，而基于 BT 的训练提高了多目标奖励函数的评分能力，使 7B 模型能够优于 70B 基线。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

*Seonghyun Park,Kiyoung Seong,Soojung Yang,Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from time-lagged conditions of a generative model, is proposed to capture the slow dynamic behavior for enhanced sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLCV methods typically focus on discriminating meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for accurate sampling.

Method: TLC learns CVs directly from time-lagged conditions of a generative model.

Result: TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. Validated on the Alanine Dipeptide system using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling (OPES).

Conclusion: TLC demonstrates equal or superior performance compared to existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state discrimination.

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving.

Conclusion: GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains

progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED

standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the

*Pengfei Jiao,Jialong Ni,Di Jin,Xuan Guo,Huan Liu,Hongjiang Chen,Yanxian Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes HGMP, a multi-task prompt framework for heterogeneous graphs, to address the mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks. It uses a unified graph-level task format, a contrastive pre-training strategy, and heterogeneous feature prompts. Experiments show it outperforms baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training and fine-tuning methods in heterogeneous graph neural networks face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction but struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain.

Method: A novel multi-task prompt framework named HGMP, which includes reformulating downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format, a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy, and heterogeneous feature prompts.

Result: The proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HGMP method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods on public datasets.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: 深度神经网络能够学习和表示训练数据的量子和后量子生成模型，且其几何关系独立于网络架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络是否能够发现和表示其训练数据的潜在生成模型。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，包括transformers和RNNs，并通常在下一个token预测上进行预训练。

Result: 神经网络可以轻松找到这些表示，而没有有限的经典电路可以做到这一点。由不同输入序列引起的神经激活之间的相应几何关系在很大程度上独立于神经网络架构。几何中的每个点对应于历史诱导的关于所有可能未来的概率密度，并且这些点的相对位移反映了这些不同的过去影响未来的机制和幅度差异。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够发现并表示训练数据的“量子”和“后量子”低维生成模型上的信念，就像在推理过程中观察更多上下文时，对该世界模型的潜在状态执行迭代贝叶斯更新一样。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Conclusion: We expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DTME-MTL的框架，该框架通过在token空间中进行操作，有效地提升了多任务学习的性能，且计算开销很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习(MTL)支持在共享网络中学习多个任务，但任务间目标差异会导致负迁移，即一个任务的学习会降低另一个任务的性能。虽然预训练的transformer显著提高了MTL性能，但其固定的网络容量和刚性结构限制了适应性。先前的动态网络架构试图解决这个问题，但由于它们直接将共享参数转换为特定于任务的参数，因此效率低下。

Method: 提出动态Token调制和扩展（DTME-MTL），这是一种适用于任何基于transformer的MTL架构的框架。DTME-MTL通过识别token空间中的梯度冲突并应用基于冲突类型的自适应解决方案来增强适应性并减少过度拟合。

Result: 大量实验表明，DTME-MTL持续提高多任务性能，且计算开销极小，为增强基于transformer的MTL模型提供了一种可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL通过在token空间中运行，以最小的计算开销持续提高多任务性能，为增强基于transformer的MTL模型提供可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

TL;DR: 本文比较了不同分类器在脑机接口 (BCI) 中的不确定性量化能力，发现 CSP-LDA 和 MDRM-T 表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口 (BCI) 将大脑信号转化为功能上有用的输出，但它们并不总是准确的。一个好的机器学习分类器应该能够通过给出其分类的概率来表明它对给定分类的置信度。运动意象 BCI 的标准分类器确实给出了这样的概率，但是对不确定性量化的研究仅限于深度学习。

Method: 将使用公共空间模式 (CSP-LDA) 和黎曼几何 (MDRM) 的已建立 BCI 分类器的不确定性量化能力与深度学习（深度集成和直接不确定性量化）和标准卷积神经网络 (CNN) 中的专门方法进行比较。

Result: 我们发现深度学习中常见的过度自信在 CSP-LDA 和 MDRM 中不是问题。我们发现 MDRM 不够自信，我们通过添加温度缩放 (MDRM-T) 解决了这个问题。CSP-LDA 和 MDRM-T 提供了最佳的不确定性估计，但深度集成和标准 CNN 提供了最佳分类。

Conclusion: CSP-LDA 和 MDRM-T 提供了最佳的不确定性估计，而深度集成和标准 CNN 提供了最佳分类。所有模型都能够区分容易和困难的估计，因此我们可以通过拒绝模糊的样本来提高运动意象 BCI 的准确性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PVG在非线性分类模型中提供了一条很有希望的验证路径，但它们尚未应用于复杂输入，而概念瓶颈模型（CBM）有效地将此类数据转化为可解释的概念，但受到低容量线性预测器的限制。

Method: 结合了PVG与概念编码的统一框架

Result: NCV在高性能、逻辑复杂的数据集上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器基线，并且还有助于缓解快捷行为。

Conclusion: NCV是一种很有前途的、可执行的、可验证的AI方法。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Motivation: 随着（工业）物联网的兴起，对实时AD的需求激增，需要能够处理高维流数据并且以单次通过方式运行的方法。

Method: 基于在线解相关学习方法，DAD动态学习和监控数据样本的关联结构。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，与最先进的方法相比，DAD在各种异常类型中实现了最一致和卓越的性能。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得了最佳平衡，为实时、内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的无反演正则化框架，该框架完全基于稳定分解，克服了现有技术的数值缺陷。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel framework aligned with the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using personal health data and machine learning to improve GBA modulation-based treatments by identifying key modulatory pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating signals inside the human body via synthetic nanodevices poses challenges. Existing GBA modulation-based treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and are not universally effective.

Method: The paper proposes a machine learning model to verify the requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation and evaluates it on several datasets.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA and helps identify specific modulatory pathways.

Conclusion: The paper utilizes a machine learning model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Federated Learning approaches are environmentally unsustainable at scale due to excessive communication bandwidth and computational resources.

Method: Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL)

Result: SParSeFuL bridges the gap between privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence and sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems.

Conclusion: SParSeFuL reduces energy and bandwidth consumption.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of
resource-constrained devices attempt to participate. To this end, we introduce
Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL), a resource-aware
approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and
bandwidth consumption.

TL;DR: SLOGAN通过稀疏因果建模和动态干预机制实现稳定的图表示迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督图域适应(UGDA)方法由于因果-虚假特征的纠缠和全局对齐策略的失败，通常会产生次优的结果。

Method: SLOGAN首先构建一个稀疏因果图结构，利用互信息瓶颈约束来解开稀疏、稳定的因果特征，同时通过变分推理压缩依赖于领域的虚假相关性。为了解决残余的虚假相关性，我们创新地设计了一种生成干预机制，通过跨域特征重组来打破局部虚假耦合，同时通过协方差约束来保持因果特征语义一致性。此外，为了减轻目标域伪标签中的误差累积，我们引入了一种类别自适应动态校准策略，确保稳定的判别学习。

Result: SLOGAN在多个真实世界数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SLOGAN在多个真实世界数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. It achieves higher accuracy and lower variability compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data

Method: a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder.

Result: TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%.

Conclusion: TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合联邦分割学习（FSL）和Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构，以解决传统联邦学习和分割学习的局限性，实验表明该架构具有良好的性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感领域的协作机器学习需要在企业部署中具有可扩展的、保护隐私的解决方案。传统的联邦学习（FL）依赖于中央服务器，引入了单点故障和隐私风险，而分割学习（SL）则对模型进行分区以保护隐私，但由于顺序训练，其扩展性较差。

Method: 结合联邦分割学习（FSL）与许可区块链Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL与中心化FSL的准确率相匹配，同时与基于以太坊的工作相比，减少了每个epoch的训练时间。性能和可扩展性测试表明，区块链开销最小，并保持了准确性。

Conclusion: HLF-FSL在保持与中心化FSL准确率相匹配的同时，减少了每个epoch的训练时间，并展示了企业级的可行性。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了全连接 ReLU 网络的层级有效维度，发现秩亏以几何衰减，并存在振荡秩行为的有限宽度现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解深度网络的可表达性。

Method: 我们分析了有限宽度的全连接 ReLU 网络中逐层有效维度（特征矩阵的秩）。

Result: 主要结果表明，$\\mathbb{E}[EDim(\\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\\pi)^\\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$，因此秩亏以 $1-2 / \\pi \\approx 0.3634$ 的比率几何衰减。我们还证明了亚高斯集中界，并确定了预期秩达到局部最大值的“复苏”深度。特别地，这些峰值出现在深度 $\\ell_k^*\\approx(k+1/2)\\pi/\\log(1/\\rho)$，高度约为 $\\approx (1-e^{-\\pi/2}) m \\approx 0.79m$。我们进一步表明，这种振荡秩行为是一种有限宽度现象：在正交权重初始化或强负斜率 leaky-ReLU 下，秩保持（几乎）满秩。

Conclusion: 这项研究精确地描述了随机 ReLU 层如何交替地崩溃和部分地恢复输入变化的子空间，为先前关于深度网络表达性的工作增加了细微差别。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督深度学习方法，用于分割颈动脉血管壁和斑块，并在有限的数据下提高了MRI应用的颈动脉分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多序列磁共振成像（MRI）数据中分析颈动脉（尤其是斑块）对于评估动脉粥样硬化和缺血性中风的风险至关重要。为了评估指标和放射组学特征，量化动脉粥样硬化的状态，准确的分割非常重要。然而，斑块的复杂形态和标记数据的稀缺性带来了巨大的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了融合策略和半监督学习在改善数据有限的MRI应用中颈动脉分割的潜力。

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Result: 对两种不同深度学习架构在不同压缩率下获得的解码图像的质量进行了量化，并与原始输入数据进行了比较。此外，为了提高图像解码质量指标，引入了一种对边缘保持敏感的指标，这对于三维数据分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 根据需要保留的特定特征，需要不同的架构和压缩率。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督表示可能难以在表示能力和效率之间达到理想的平衡。

Method: Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD)

Result: 该算法的 Lipschitz 性质、泛化误差界和不动点收敛的理论分析揭示了 GridTD 相对于现有连续表示模型的内在优越性。

Conclusion: GridTD在包括视频 SCI、光谱 SCI 和压缩动态 MRI 重建在内的各种 CI 任务中的广泛实验一致表明，GridTD 优于现有方法，使其成为一种通用且最先进的 CI 重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.
