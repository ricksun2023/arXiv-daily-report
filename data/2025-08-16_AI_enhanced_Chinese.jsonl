However, manual or semi-manual entry of\nstructured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow\nturnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate\ndescriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing\nretrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss\nfine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.\n  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for\ngenerating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a\nfine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key\nchallenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality\ngaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data\nrefinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures\nalignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual\nUnderstanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained\ninformation from visual inputs.\n  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference\noptimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving\nrobustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on\nreal-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms\nbaseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These\nresults demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and\ntextual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item\ndescriptions.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding.

We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses.

Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,\nreward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,\nhigh-performance language model adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RTTC \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73 TTC \u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8 LLM \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97 (TTC) \u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3 (TTT) \u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210 (RAG) \u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u67e5\u8be2\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u52a0\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u5e94\u7528 TTC \u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97 (RTTC)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684 TTC \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002RTTC \u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u5668-\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u8fdc\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528 RAG \u6216\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u91cd\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "RTTC\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8evanilla RAG\u6216TTT", "conclusion": "RTTC\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8evanilla RAG\u6216TTT\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684TTC\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u53caRTTC\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address\nthis, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel\nactive prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective\nconfusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a\ndual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format\nUncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty\n(inconsistency in extracted semantics).

However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive\ncomputation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient\nreasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token\nbudgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and\nreliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify\nthat encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to\nits solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise\nreward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of\nintermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and\nnaturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and\nAIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++.

The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)\nis commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended\nquestions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a\nnegative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions\nprovide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require\ntime-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether\nlarge language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We\nused a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain\ninjury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their\nopen-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these\nresponses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested\nthe fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed\nthat model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions\nof hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher\nalignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and\naccidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group\ndifferences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI\nand HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent\nnonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible\nscoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options.

A persisting challenge\nis model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more\nmixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we\ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for\noverspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown\n$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the\npopulation level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we\nestablish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nsteps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe\nsublinear convergence in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample\nlevel, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we\ndemonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with\nsufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$\ngiven $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

While numerous technical and review papers\nexist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts\ninclude transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to\nsemi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation\nand fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from\nsingle-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in\ndataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In\nthis review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight\nrepresentative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with\n3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive\nbenchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning\nmethodologies, including recent foundation models.

Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region\nPolicy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each\nagent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,\nespecially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:\nHATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes\nthreshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy\nalgorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By\nconnecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold\nscheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in\nheterogeneous-agent settings.

Using this benchmark, we systematically\nanalyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences\nestimation accuracy.

Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy\nin which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones.

Current approaches for personalizing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nfollowed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models\nhow to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards\nsometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency\nand personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for\npersonalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural\nlanguage feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and\nthe question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision\nsignal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and\ninternalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between\noptimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved\nresponses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at\ninference.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information\non the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and\nhandwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory.

But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically\ntrained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the\ncontrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other.

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels.

We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations.

Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data.

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms.

To address these gaps, we introduce\nRealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal\nTOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired\nspeech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with\nannotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of\nreal-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel\ncross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user\ninteractions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.\nOur evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker\ncharacteristics, and cross-domain performance.

This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where\ndecisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand\nnot only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to\nensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional\nfederated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize\nprimarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving\nCoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,\nexisting methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating\nknowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication\noverhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial.

The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost\nand input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.\nWe experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques\nfor learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets\nwhile remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LATTE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u901a\u4fe1\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5ba2\u6237\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u957f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u662f\u6602\u8d35\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0eLLM\u5b8c\u6574\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing models often suffer from degraded\ngeneralization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily\narises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data\nannotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift\nbetween training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these\nissues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework\n(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to\ncost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.\nSpecifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to\naccurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training\nexamples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM\nvision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic\nsamples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the\naugmented dataset.

However, these\nmodels still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled\nwith specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie\nChaplin\", a ``mustache\" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not\nto include it, as the concept of ``mustache\" is strongly entangled with\n``Charlie Chaplin\". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to\ndirectly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of\ndiffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text\nembedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,\nand we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained\nthrough a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression\nwith Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention\nmechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions\nwhere it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise\nsuppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which\nprevious baselines were unable to achieve.

In domains like trading or the stock\nmarket, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),\ncan be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals\nthat people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text\nand visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We\npropose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify\nhow users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based\nagent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human\nresponses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response\nModel Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol\n(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows\nT-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability\nand interaction capabilities.

PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a\nlarge language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific\nguideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and\ncompleteness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these\nfactors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and\ncontext, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage\napplies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring\nbaseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of\ncoverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,\nand allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger\nones.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

In this work, we introduce\nContrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier\nattempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise\nconfusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,\nwe model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which\nemphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the\nspecificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an\nadaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a\nlearnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an\nadjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship\nbetween the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.\nMeanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is\nintroduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual\nprompts during incremental training.

Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive\ndiagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,\n0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTAMP\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u80ba\u817a\u764c\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u95f4\u9699\u6269\u6563\uff08STAS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u6c14\u95f4\u9699\u6269\u6563\uff08STAS\uff09\u662f\u80ba\u817a\u764c\uff08LUAD\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4fb5\u88ad\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u590d\u53d1\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u6709\u5173\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cLUAD\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21STAS\u8bca\u65ad\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u758f\u5ffd\u548c\u8bef\u8bca\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cSTAS\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6STAMP\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2dSTAS\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eSTAS\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0eSTAS\u75c5\u7406\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u8de8\u5206\u652f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "STAMP\u5728STAS-SXY\u3001STAS-TXY\u548cSTAS-TCGA\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cAUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.8058\u30010.8017\u548c0.7928\u3002", "conclusion": "STAMP\u5728STAS-SXY\u3001STAS-TXY\u548cSTAS-TCGA\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cAUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.8058\u30010.8017\u548c0.7928\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial\npotential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their\naccuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,\nICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot\nlearning approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4bCHR\u60a3\u8005\u7684BPRS\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5916\u8bed\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u9ad8\u5371\uff08CHR\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u5207\u76d1\u6d4b\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7b80\u660e\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u8bc4\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\uff08BPRS\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\uff1b\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u5e38\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u5197\u957f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u81eaAMP-SCZ\u961f\u5217\u4e2d409\u540dCHR\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684BPRS\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u95f4\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a0.84\uff0cICC\uff1a0.73\uff09\u3002LLM\u5728\u5916\u8bed\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a0.88\uff0cICC\uff1a0.70\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5355\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u7eb5\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316CHR\u60a3\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5916\u8bed\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6574\u5408\u7eb5\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization\nframework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric\nconstraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of\nquadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency\ncomponents. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting\nstrategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient\nanalysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric\nregularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the\nmodel to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions\nrequiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in\npreserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining\nreal-time rendering efficiency.

However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive\nlanguage models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity\ngeneration remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or\ntightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose\nMAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that\nunifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:\nCognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration\nwithin a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three\nrole-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -\nengage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and\nplanning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism\nthat orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a\nmutually reinforcing manner.

Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance\nmotion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of\njointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains\nlargely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts\nhuman dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the\negocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose\nestimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the\ngenerated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical\ninputs.

Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the\nintroduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling\ntasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application\nscenario is improved by 13%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297Transformer (GAT) \u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700ground-truth\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7c92\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u7740\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u4f8b\u3002\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297Transformer (GAT)", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee (RMSE) \u964d\u4f4e 9%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236 (MPC) \u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 13%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297Transformer (GAT) \u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u4efb\u4f55ground-truth\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee (RMSE) \u964d\u4f4e 9%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236 (MPC) \u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 13%\u3002"}}
