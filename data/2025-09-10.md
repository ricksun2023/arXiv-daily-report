### [1] [MedBench-IT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Italian Medical Entrance Examinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07135)
*Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Alessandro Angioi,Michelangelo Puliga,Davide Sanna,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MedBench-IT，一个用于评估LLMs在意大利医学入学考试表现的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏针对非英语语言在专业领域的LLM基准测试，尤其是在意大利医学教育领域。

Method: 构建了MedBench-IT基准，包含来自Edizioni Simone的17,410个多项选择题，涵盖六个科目和三个难度级别。评估了包括GPT-4o、Claude系列和开源模型在内的多种模型。

Result: 进行了严格的重复性测试（88.86%的响应一致性），排序偏差分析（影响极小）和推理提示评估。发现问题可读性和模型性能之间存在统计显着但较小的反向关系。

Conclusion: MedBench-IT为意大利NLP社区、EdTech开发者和从业者提供了一个关键资源，为该关键领域提供了对当前能力和标准化评估方法的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

*William Chen,Chutong Meng,Jiatong Shi,Martijn Bartelds,Shih-Heng Wang,Hsiu-Hsuan Wang,Rafael Mosquera,Sara Hincapie,Dan Jurafsky,Antonis Anastasopoulos,Hung-yi Lee,Karen Livescu,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge introduces a new test suite with 200+ languages, accents, and dialects to evaluate multilingual speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve multilingual ASR performance across diverse languages and language varieties, which has been unevenly distributed.

Method: A new test suite and an online evaluation server based on DynaBench were constructed.

Result: The best submission achieved significant improvements in LID accuracy (23%) and CER reduction (18%) on a general multilingual test set. Accented and dialectal data saw even greater improvements (30.2% lower CER and 15.7% higher LID accuracy).

Conclusion: Community challenges are important for making speech technologies more inclusive.

Abstract: Recent improvements in multilingual ASR have not been equally distributed
across languages and language varieties. To advance state-of-the-art (SOTA) ASR
models, we present the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge. We construct a
new test suite that consists of data from 200+ languages, accents, and dialects
to evaluate SOTA multilingual speech models. The challenge also introduces an
online evaluation server based on DynaBench, allowing for flexibility in model
design and architecture for participants. The challenge received 5 submissions
from 3 teams, all of which outperformed our baselines. The best-performing
submission achieved an absolute improvement in LID accuracy of 23% and a
reduction in CER of 18% when compared to the best baseline on a general
multilingual test set. On accented and dialectal data, the best submission
obtained 30.2% lower CER and 15.7% higher LID accuracy, showing the importance
of community challenges in making speech technologies more inclusive.

### [3] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 自动评估动态演化主题模型的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主题建模对于组织和检索数字图书馆系统中的学术内容至关重要，但广泛使用的自动指标通常只捕获狭窄的统计模式，无法解释实际中的语义失败。

Method: 该框架采用九个基于 LLM 的指标，涵盖主题质量的四个关键维度：词汇有效性、主题内语义合理性、主题间结构合理性和文档-主题对齐合理性。

Result: 基于 LLM 的指标提供了可解释、稳健且与任务相关的评估，揭示了主题模型中的关键弱点，例如冗余和语义漂移，而传统指标通常会忽略这些弱点。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持开发可扩展的、细粒度的评估工具，以在动态数据集中保持主题相关性。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting
this work are accessible at

### [4] [Towards EnergyGPT: A Large Language Model Specialized for the Energy Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07177)
*Amal Chebbi,Babajide Kolade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnergyGPT is a domain-specialized language model for the energy sector, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.1-8B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs are not effective in specialized fields like energy, which require deep technical expertise.

Method: Supervised Fine-Tuning on a curated corpus of energy-related texts.

Result: EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most energy-related language understanding and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The training strategy improves domain relevance and performance without large-scale infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [5] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个新的基准测试DischargeSim，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在出院宣教方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准测试主要关注诊断推理，忽略了模型在出院后支持患者的能力。出院沟通是患者护理的关键组成部分，目标从诊断转向教育。

Method: DischargeSim模拟了LLM驱动的医生代理和具有不同心理特征的患者代理之间的多轮对话。对话围绕六个临床主题展开，并从对话质量、个性化文档生成和患者理解三个方面进行评估。

Result: 对18个LLM的实验表明，LLM在出院宣教能力方面存在显著差距，且性能因患者 प्रोफाइल而异。模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果。

Conclusion: DischargeSim是评估LLM在出院后临床教育方面能力的第一步，旨在促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [6] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于规则的道德原则框架，用于处理LLM生成文本中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景中，解释不确定性至关重要，但现有的概率方法不够透明且与透明度期望不符。

Method: 使用来自道德心理学和美德伦理学的见解，定义了诸如预防、顺从和责任等规则，以指导认知或偶然不确定性下的响应。这些规则被编码在轻量级Prolog引擎中。

Result: 基于情景的模拟测试了规则覆盖率、公平性和信任校准。临床和法律领域的用例表明，道德推理可以提高信任度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任自然语言生成提供了一种透明、轻量级的概率模型替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [7] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用大型语言模型分析了德国议会辩论中关于移民的政治言论，特别是（反）团结亚型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是传统政治言论研究依赖大量人工标注，限制了分析范围。本文旨在探索大型语言模型在自动化复杂标注任务中的潜力，并深入了解德国二战后至今的移民（反）团结趋势。

Method: 本文对比评估了多个大型语言模型在标注德国议会辩论中（反）团结亚型方面的表现，与大量人工标注数据进行对比，并评估了模型大小、prompting差异、微调以及历史与当代数据的影响，并调查了系统性误差。

Result: 研究结果表明，二战后德国议会中对移民的团结程度较高，但自2015年以来，反团结趋势明显增强。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明大型语言模型在政治文本分析中具有潜力，并强调了德国移民辩论的重要性。

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

### [8] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE: Updates keys in causal attention with lookahead to integrate future information while preserving autoregressive property, enabling efficient parallel training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard causal attention uses static QKV, encoding only preceding context. The paper aims to improve this.

Method: Introduces CAuSal aTtention with Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each token's keys as the context unfolds. It derives a mathematical equivalence to avoid explicitly materializing lookahead keys at each position and enables efficient parallel training.

Result: CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a range of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CASTLE improves upon standard causal attention by updating keys with future information, leading to better performance in language modeling tasks.

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

### [9] [Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07308)
*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像状态判断方法BVM，并与现有方法在MIT-States数据集上进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提出一种新的方法BVM，用于判断图像中的状态变化。

Method: 使用语言嵌入，在包含约53000张图像的MIT-States数据集上，将BVM与余弦相似度、点积等多种方法进行比较，以判断名词和形容词的状态。

Result: BVM在名词状态分类中表现最佳，但在区分形容词方面与logistic回归模型相比没有明显优势。但发现BVM具有改进潜力。

Conclusion: BVM在图像状态判断方面具有潜力，通过改进方法有望提高准确性。

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

### [10] [Instance-level Performance Prediction for Long-form Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07309)
*Chi-Yang Hsu,Alexander Braylan,Yiheng Su,Omar Alonso,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于长文本生成的实例级别性能预测的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在预测具有多方面、细粒度质量指标的长文本生成任务的性能。

Method: 该方法与任务、模型和指标无关，仅使用黑盒模型的输入和输出来预测连续的评估指标得分，并推断预测区间以量化点估计周围的不确定性。

Result: 在11个长文本数据集/任务上，使用多个LLM、基线和每个任务的指标进行评估，表明仅使用16个训练示例即可有效地预测长文本生成任务的得分。

Conclusion: 引入了一项新颖而有用的任务，一个有价值的基准来推动进展，以及可供实际采用的基线。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [11] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择方法KAMIR，通过分析模型的内部表示来选择更有效的数据，克服了传统方法prompt工程的局限性，并且适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法在训练数据选择上缺乏有效方法，简单增加数据量不能保证性能提升，而预处理、抽样和验证成本高昂。传统知识选择方法依赖prompt工程，对变化敏感且成本高。

Method: 提出KAMIR方法，通过计算模型每一层hidden state和最终hidden state的相似度来评估数据，选择模型不熟悉的数据进行训练。

Result: 在多个任务数据集上的实验表明，使用不熟悉的数据进行训练可以带来更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: KAMIR方法可以通过分析模型内部表示，选择更有效的训练数据，提高模型泛化性能，且适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

### [12] [Mitigating Attention Localization in Small Scale: Self-Attention Refinement via One-step Belief Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07324)
*Nakyung Lee,Yeongoon Kim,Minhae Oh,Suhwan Kim,Jin Woo Koo,Hyewon Jo,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP) 的改进框架，旨在解决 Transformer 模型中 self-attention 机制的 localization 问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型中的 self-attention 机制存在 localization 问题，导致无法捕捉长距离依赖关系。

Method: 通过 belief propagation 过程注入多跳关系，提出 SAOBP 框架，并引入 Global Token Dependency (GTD) 来量化多跳连接的相对贡献。

Result: SAOBP 能够防止更深层中的熵坍塌，自适应地将 GTD 维持在适合任务的水平，从而提高模型性能。在小规模模型中观察到有竞争力的收益。

Conclusion: SAOBP 具有提高资源受限场景中推理质量的潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Zihan Chen,Lei Shi,Weize Wu,Qiji Zhou,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ALLabel的三阶段框架，旨在选择信息量最大、最具代表性的样本，为LLM建模准备演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然科学领域，越来越多的研究需要从科学数据集中进行大规模、高性能的实体识别。大型语言模型（LLM）已被广泛应用于解决实体识别任务，但微调过程通常成本高昂。

Method: 提出ALLabel，一个三阶段框架，旨在选择信息量最大、最具代表性的样本，为LLM上下文学习准备演示。通过依次采用三种不同的主动学习策略。

Result: 在相同的注释预算下，ALLabel在三个专门的领域数据集上始终优于所有基线。选择性地注释数据集中5％-10％的样本，就可以达到与注释整个数据集的方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 验证了ALLabel的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse 是一个 LLM 后训练框架，它使 LLM 能够适应和表达不同的个性以适应不同的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在现实世界的对话中通常在情感感知和社交能力方面表现出局限性，部分原因是它们无法调整其沟通方式和情感表达以适应不同的社交和任务环境。

Method: PersonaFuse 采用混合专家架构，该架构将角色适配器与动态路由网络相结合，从而实现情境特征表达。

Result: PersonaFuse 在社交情感智能的多个维度上显着优于基线模型，而不会牺牲一般推理能力或模型安全性。PersonaFuse 还在以人为本的下游应用中实现了持续改进，例如心理健康咨询和基于评论的客户服务。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse 提供了一种理论上扎实且实用的方法来开发社交情感增强的 LLM，标志着朝着以人为本的 AI 系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

*Xixi Wu,Yanchao Tan,Nan Hou,Ruiyang Zhang,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoLoRAG的逻辑感知检索框架，用于多模态、多页文档理解，该框架通过构建页面图来捕获页面之间的上下文关系，并使用轻量级VLM执行图遍历以检索相关页面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转换为文本以供大型语言模型处理，但这会去除关键的多模态信息（如图形）。大型视觉语言模型虽然解决了这个问题，但其受限的输入大小使得多页文档理解变得不可行。检索增强生成方法通过选择相关页面来缓解这个问题，但它们仅依赖于语义相关性，忽略了页面和查询之间的逻辑连接，而这对于推理至关重要。

Method: 构建一个页面图，该图捕获页面之间的上下文关系，轻量级VLM执行图遍历以检索相关页面，结合语义和逻辑相关性以提供更准确的检索。MoLoRAG提供两种变体：一种是免训练解决方案，另一种是微调版本。

Result: 在四个DocQA数据集上的实验表明，MoLoRAG的准确率比LVLM直接推理平均提高了9.68%，检索精度比基线提高了7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过结合语义和逻辑相关性，能够更有效地检索多模态、多页文档中的相关信息，从而提高文档问答的准确率。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在通过模式识别和互动反馈学习语言方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型评估主要集中在词汇、形态、句法、语用和跨语言迁移等方面，忽略了人类通过模式识别和互动反馈学习语言的关键特征。

Method: 构建了一种新的实验框架，其中LLM agent需要通过与只理解Tinkatongue的机器人对话来学习和使用Tinkatongue。

Result: LLM agent在100个回合内未能建立对话，但采用了类似人类的语言学习策略。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要新的评估基准，并为更有效地从互动反馈中学习的模型设计开辟了道路。

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for structured information extraction from scientific literature are limited in scope (specific sections) due to domain complexity and annotation costs. SciNLP aims to address this by providing full-text annotations.

Method: Manually annotated 60 full-text NLP publications. Evaluated state-of-the-art supervised models and compared performance with existing datasets.

Result: SciNLP shows varying extraction capabilities of existing models across different text lengths and achieves significant performance improvements on certain baselines. Constructed a knowledge graph with an average node degree of 3.2 per entity.

Conclusion: SciNLP is a valuable resource for full-text NLP entity and relation extraction, enabling the construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Motivation: 现有基准忽略了长文本场景下情感智能的某些方面，尤其是在真实、实际的交互环境中。

Method: 设计了 LongEmotion 基准，并采用了检索增强生成 (RAG) 和协同情感建模 (CoEM) 来提升性能。RAG 利用对话上下文和 LLM 本身作为检索源，CoEM 将任务分解为五个阶段。

Result: RAG 和 CoEM 在大多数长文本任务中持续提升了与情感智能相关的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了 LLM 在更实用和真实的 EI 应用中的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Motivation: 目前对于社交媒体中积极、支持性的在线交流（友善言论）的自动检测还不够完善，这限制了对其影响的系统分析。

Method: 使用单语和多语语言模型（GBERT、Qwen3 Embedding 和 XLM-RoBERTa）在 46k 评论的德语 YouTube 数据集上进行实验，检测友善言论。

Result: 多语种 XLM-RoBERTa-Large 模型在 GermEval 2025 Candy Speech Detection 共享任务中表现最佳，在二元积极 F1 (0.8906) 和分类跨度检测 (strict F1: 0.6307) 子任务中均排名第一。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，多语种模型在识别积极支持性语言方面非常有效。

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the

span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of

Motivation: 污名化语言导致医疗不平等，但目前缺乏统一的污名化语言标准词典。

Method: 系统性地搜索文献，识别现有污名化语言词典，并进行比较分析。

Result: 研究识别出四个词典，它们之间语义相似度中等，且多数污名化术语与临床医生描述负面行为的判断性表达有关。情感分析显示负面术语占主导地位，但不同词典存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了建立标准化词典的必要性，并突出了定义临床文本中污名化语言的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Motivation: 安全部署生成语言模型面临挑战，需要检测与源文本矛盾或不支持的内容。

Method: 该框架使用通用特征集，该特征集来自两个冻结的、现成的自然语言推理（NLI）模型和一个轻量级词汇信号集合。这些特征被用于训练一个简单的、校准的和任务自适应的元分类器。

Result: 通过将通用特征集与轻量级的、任务自适应的分类器和精度约束的决策策略相结合，HALT-RAG在总结、QA和对话任务上分别实现了0.7756、0.9786和0.7391的强OOF F1分数。

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for

Motivation: 现有OS agent在真实环境中面临不可信条件下的过度执行风险。

Method: 提出了一个query-driven的人机交互框架，并在此基础上训练了一个名为VeriOS-Agent的可信OS agent，该agent采用两阶段学习范式，能够在正常情况下自主执行操作，并在不可信情况下主动向人类query。

Result: 实验表明，VeriOS-Agent在不可信场景下的平均步进成功率比现有技术提高了20.64%，且不影响正常性能。

Conclusion: 分析表明，VeriOS-Agent具有合理性、通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）的知识编辑方法在多跳问答中存在“编辑跳过”问题。

Method: 提出了一种迭代检索增强知识编辑方法，通过编辑事实和案例进行引导分解（IRAKE）。

Result: IRAKE 缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IRAKE 在多跳问答的知识编辑中表现出色。

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Motivation: 现有的生物医学LLM对复杂的、特定领域的概念结构和生物医学知识图谱(KGs)中编码的事实信息的理解有限。

Method: 将生物医学概念提及链接到统一医学语言系统(UMLS) KG，并利用局部KG子图作为这些提及的跨模态正样本。

Conclusion: 即使在来自PubMed科学摘要的小型对齐数据集上进行最少的预训练，该方法也能提高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Motivation: 临床报告冗长且充满术语，领域专家难以高效识别重要信息。

Result: 在GPT-4和GPT-4o上使用视角感知ISP (PA-ISP) 的提交在3,396份临床病例报告上取得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERT分数(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP (PA-ISP) 可用于临床报告总结，并支持患者和临床医生之间更好的沟通。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Conclusion: 需要在医学领域采用能够保持医学内容完整性的领域感知水印方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上的虚假新闻和有害内容是一个严重的问题，需要有效的方法来检测。

Method: 该研究在 10 个数据集和 5 种语言上，测试了不同的参数高效微调和上下文学习策略，包括零样本提示、代码本、少样本和思维链。

Result: 研究发现，上下文学习通常不如微调模型。

Conclusion: 即使与在上下文学习中评估的最大模型相比，在特定任务设置中微调较小的模型也很重要。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

*Xiaolin Chen,Xuemeng Song,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan,Xiangyu Zhao,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为DK2R的新方法，利用双重知识（结构化属性和非结构化评论知识）和大型语言模型来改进多模态面向任务的对话系统中的文本响应生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了非结构化评论知识，并且未能充分利用大型语言模型。

Method: DK2R首先从外部知识库中提取结构化属性和非结构化评论知识，然后使用大型语言模型评估每种知识类型的效用。此外，DK2R通过专门的推理总结面向意图的关键线索，这些线索进一步用作辅助信号，以增强基于LLM的文本响应生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上进行的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性。

Conclusion: DK2R方法在多模态面向任务的对话系统中，利用双重知识和大型语言模型，有效地提升了文本响应生成的质量。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

### [32] [Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07829)
*Mihai Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2) for English-Romanian literary translations, including a fine-tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large-scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The translation by small open models remains an open problem, and there is a need for rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as Romanian.

Method: The pipeline generates 15k high quality Romanian references, and applies a two stage fine tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five dimension LLM based rubric.

Result: The fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost effective.

Conclusion: TF2 provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的输出不稳定，因为解码过程的非确定性和提示的脆弱性。我们比较了提示修改对 LLM 的影响以及相同指令修改对人工标注者的影响，重点关注人类是否对提示扰动同样敏感的问题。我们的研究结果表明，人类和 LLM 都对特定类型的提示修改表现出更高的脆弱性，特别是那些涉及替代标签集或标签格式的修改。但是，与 LLM 相比，人类判断的分布受排版错误和标签顺序颠倒的影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的输出不稳定，因为解码过程的非确定性和提示的脆弱性。提示脆弱性效应在很大程度上被认为是 LLM 独有的，但尚未得到探索。这引出了一个问题：人工标注者是否对指令更改表现出类似的敏感性？如果是这样，LLM 中的提示脆弱性是否应被视为有问题？或者，可以假设提示脆弱性正确地反映了人工标注的差异。为了填补这一研究空白，

Method: 我们系统地比较了提示修改对 LLM 的影响以及相同指令修改对人工标注者的影响，重点关注人类是否对提示扰动同样敏感的问题。为了研究这一点，我们提示人类和 LLM 完成一组基于提示变化的文本分类任务。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，人类和 LLM 都对特定类型的提示修改表现出更高的脆弱性，特别是那些涉及替代标签集或标签格式的修改。但是，与 LLM 相比，人类判断的分布受排版错误和标签顺序颠倒的影响较小。

Conclusion: 人类和 LLM 都对特定类型的提示修改表现出更高的脆弱性，特别是那些涉及替代标签集或标签格式的修改。但是，与 LLM 相比，人类判断的分布受排版错误和标签顺序颠倒的影响较小。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

*Chengyan Wu,Yiqiang Cai,Yufei Cheng,Yun Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究针对NLPCC-2025的第七项共享任务，即中文句子层面的性别偏见检测与缓解，提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）微调的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过自动检测、分类和缓解性别偏见，促进自然语言生成中的公平性和可控性。

Method: 采用基于大型语言模型的微调方法，通过低秩适应（LoRA）高效适应偏见检测任务；构建更平衡的训练集，引入来自多个来源的异构样本以增强模型泛化能力；采用多数投票策略整合多个专家模型的输出以提高性能；设计多温度抽样机制以捕获偏见表达风格的潜在变化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在偏见检测、分类和缓解方面有效，最终在共享任务中获得47.90%的平均分，排名第四。

Conclusion: 该方法在性别偏见检测与缓解方面表现出有效性，并在NLPCC-2025共享任务中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究关注大型语言模型（LLM）生成的故事中存在的文化和性别偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 父母越来越依赖LLM创作睡前故事，但这些故事中可能存在文化和性别偏见。

Method: 构建了一个名为Biased Tales的数据集，用于分析LLM生成的故事中偏见如何影响主角的属性和故事元素。

Result: 发现当主角被描述为女孩时，与外貌相关的属性增加了55.26%。与西方儿童的故事相比，以非西方儿童为主角的故事更侧重于文化遗产、传统和家庭主题。

Conclusion: 强调了社会文化偏见在使AI创作更公平和多样化中的作用。

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GENUINE的结构感知框架，利用依赖解析树和分层图池来改进不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略语义依赖性，依赖于token级别的概率测量，无法捕获生成文本中的结构关系。

Method: 通过结合监督学习，GENUINE有效地建模语义和结构关系，从而改进置信度评估。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的大量实验表明，GENUINE的AUROC比基于语义熵的方法高出29%，校准误差减少超过15%。

Conclusion: 基于图的不确定性建模是有效的。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

Motivation: OpenAI 的 SimpleQA 基准存在噪声标签、主题偏差和问题冗余等局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段过滤过程，包括去重、主题平衡和来源协调，创建了一个更可靠和具有挑战性的评估集，并改进了自动评估器提示。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro 在该基准上取得了 55.6 的 F1 分数，优于其他模型，包括 GPT-5。

Abstract: We introduce SimpleQA Verified, a 1,000-prompt benchmark for evaluating Large
Language Model (LLM) short-form factuality based on OpenAI's SimpleQA. It
addresses critical limitations in OpenAI's benchmark, including noisy and
incorrect labels, topical biases, and question redundancy. SimpleQA Verified
was created through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process involving
de-duplication, topic balancing, and source reconciliation to produce a more
reliable and challenging evaluation set, alongside improvements in the
autorater prompt. On this new benchmark, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves a
state-of-the-art F1-score of 55.6, outperforming other frontier models,
including GPT-5. This work provides the research community with a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习框架 Parallel-R1，用于训练大型语言模型 (LLM) 的并行思考能力，以解决复杂现实推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖于在合成数据上进行监督微调 (SFT)，鼓励教师强制模仿，而不是探索和泛化，激活这种能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 该框架采用渐进式课程，显式地解决了 RL 训练并行思考中的冷启动问题。首先在 prompt 生成的来自更容易任务的轨迹上使用 SFT 来灌输并行思考能力，然后过渡到 RL 以探索和泛化这种在更难问题上的技能。

Result: 在各种数学基准测试（包括 MATH、AMC23 和 AIME）上的实验表明，Parallel-R1 成功地灌输了并行思考，与直接在具有 RL 的挑战性任务上训练的顺序思考模型相比，准确率提高了 8.4%。

Conclusion: 验证了并行思考作为一种中期训练探索支架，其中这种临时探索阶段在 RL 之后解锁了更高的性能上限，在 AIME25 上比基线提高了 42.9%。

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

TL;DR: CellPainTR: A Transformer-based model for learning foundational representations of cellular morphology robust to batch effects, enabling out-of-distribution generalization to unseen datasets without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technical batch effects and a lack of generalizable models hinder large-scale biological discovery using heterogeneous datasets.

Method: A Transformer-based architecture (CellPainTR) with source-specific context tokens.

Result: CellPainTR outperforms established methods in batch integration and biological signal preservation on the JUMP dataset and maintains high performance on the unseen Bray et al. dataset.

Conclusion: CellPainTR represents a significant step towards creating foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and scalable cross-study biological analysis.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态融合架构，用于检测铁路缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态方法在检测与正常结构元素相似的缺陷时存在过度检测的问题。

Method: 该方法基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer，结合图像和合成音频特征图进行融合。

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，该多模态融合方法比仅使用视觉的方法提高了0.2个百分点的精度和整体准确率。

Conclusion: 多模态融合可以有效提高铁路缺陷检测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的后验OOD检测方法ClaFR，该方法通过子空间投影实现，无需访问训练数据，并在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后验OOD检测方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护的场景中不适用。

Method: 该方法首先对分类器的权重进行正交分解，提取类别已知的子空间，然后将原始数据特征映射到该子空间以获得新的数据表示。随后，通过计算子空间内数据的特征重建误差来确定OOD分数。

Result: 该方法在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先的性能，且无需访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR方法是一种有效的OOD检测方法，它解决了现有方法需要访问训练数据的问题，并在性能上取得了提升。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DIET-CP的简单持续预训练策略，旨在解决在小数据集上微调大型预训练模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定领域，可用数据集通常很小，限制了大规模预训练的SSL方法的适用性，并使超参数搜索变得不可行。此外，预训练模型通常仅作为骨干权重发布，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息。

Method: DIET-CP依赖于一个非常简单的目标，不需要标签，并且不引入比监督微调更多的超参数。

Result: DIET-CP在数据模式和骨干选择上是稳定的，同时仅使用1000张图像即可为最先进的模型（如DINOv3）提供显着的性能提升。

Conclusion: DIET-CP是一种有效的持续预训练策略，可以帮助将强大的基础模型调整到感兴趣的新数据分布。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

TL;DR: 联邦对抗提示调整（FedAPT）是一种提高联邦提示调整（FPT）对抗鲁棒性的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用FPT调整的模型容易受到对抗性攻击，导致下游任务中的错误分类。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了FedAPT。

Method: 我们提出了一个类别感知的提示生成器，该生成器从文本提示生成视觉提示，并由全局标签嵌入引导。此外，我们提出了一个跨层生成器共享策略，以增强模型不同层之间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的大量实验表明，FedAPT在提高对抗鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedAPT在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出卓越的泛化能力，表明其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [45] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD) 框架，用于评估视觉语言模型在企业应用中的性能，弥合学术评估与实际部署需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖选择题和合成数据，无法捕捉真实商业应用的复杂性，例如社交媒体内容分析。

Method: ViLD 框架定义了十个关键业务任务，并引入了 BlockWeaver 算法来比较来自视觉语言模型的无序、可变分组的 OCR 输出，无需依赖嵌入或大型语言模型。

Result: 构建了一个包含 7,500 个多样化样本的新基准数据集，这些样本来自一百万张真实图像和视频。

Conclusion: 通过 ViLD 框架对领先的开源视觉语言模型进行了基准测试，为企业环境中视觉语言模型的部署提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [46] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为 Protocol Genome 的自监督学习系统，该系统通过学习 DICOM 头部信息中的关联性，在完全保留的外部验证集上实现了 AUROC 0.901 和 ECE 0.036，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过 PACS/DICOM 传输，程序选择（扫描仪制造商/型号、序列、内核、kVp、TR/TE 和切片厚度）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影。这些潜在的混杂因素阻碍了仅图像网络在不同站点之间的泛化。

Method: Protocol Genome 获取去识别的头部字段的标记化嵌入，并使用以下方法将其与图像特征一起建模：（1）协议-图像对比学习，（2）掩码协议预测，（3）协议-协议翻译。

Result: 在 126 万项研究（7 个医疗系统，31 台扫描仪，3 家供应商；CT、MR、CR/DR）的基础上，我们进行了以下实验：（A）用于 PE 的胸部 CT 分诊，（B）脑 MRI 胶质瘤分级，以及（C）胸部 X 光片心脏肥大检测。相对于强大的 SSL 基线（SimCLR、MAE）以及 ImageNet 迁移，Protocol Genome 与更高的外部 AUROC 相关；获得了 25-37% 的校准改进。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome 技术降低了协议边界处的假阳性，并且适用于 PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO)。我们发布了一个模型卡和部署指南，其中包括去识别和偏差审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理受损文本时的鲁棒性，发现它们在识别被分割、重组或覆盖的字符时表现不佳，即使人类可以轻松识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于考察先进的视觉语言模型是否像人类一样，对书写文字具有普遍的文化适应性和容错性，尤其是在字符受损的情况下。

Method: 构建了两个受心理物理学启发的基准测试，分别针对中文象形文字和英文表音文字，通过拼接、重组和覆盖字形来生成“可见但不可读”的刺激，用于测试模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管视觉语言模型在清晰文本上表现出色，但在处理受损文本时性能显著下降，通常产生不相关或不连贯的输出。

Conclusion: 研究表明，这些模型过度依赖通用的视觉不变性，而对鲁棒性阅读所需的组合先验知识依赖不足。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

TL;DR: 本研究针对动态心脏磁共振成像（CMR）中k空间数据稀缺的问题，提出了一种在频域进行特征学习和时间融合的k空间数据合成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决动态心脏MRI重建中高质量和多样化的k空间数据难以获取的问题。

Method: 该方法直接在频域进行特征学习，并采用时间融合策略作为生成指导来合成k空间数据。利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，在频域进行特征建模，并整合跨时间帧的k空间数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据状态下具有很强的生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺的实际潜力。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本文研究了模型在语义和感知上不同的类别中推广属性知识的能力，发现模型在训练和测试类别之间的相关性降低时性能会急剧下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中在狭窄的分类或视觉相似的领域内的属性预测，但是否目前的模型可以提取属性并将其应用于概念上不同的类别仍不清楚。本文旨在评估属性预测任务在这种条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 本文提出了基于LLM驱动的语义分组、嵌入相似性阈值、基于嵌入的聚类以及使用ground-truth标签的超类别划分的训练-测试集划分策略，以逐步降低训练和测试集之间的相关性。

Result: 结果表明，随着训练和测试类别之间相关性的降低，性能急剧下降，表明对分割设计非常敏感。在评估的方法中，聚类产生了最有效的权衡，减少了隐藏的相关性，同时保持了可学习性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为当前表示的局限性提供了新的见解，并为属性推理的未来基准构建提供了信息。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM生成3D形状的几何和结构保真度的方法尚不完善。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性，以评估生成的模型。

Result: 研究结果表明，随着语义丰富度的增加，生成保真度得到提高，代码级别的提示在所有指标上都实现了完美的重建。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅加深了对人工智能辅助形状合成的理解，而且为验证和改进各种CAD应用中的生成模型提供了一种可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS$^{2}$大幅降低了3D高斯溅射的内存消耗，使其更适用于边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射压缩方法未能解决渲染内存这一瓶颈问题。

Method: 用轻量级的任意方向球形高斯瓣代替高消耗内存的球谐函数作为颜色表示，并提出了一个统一的软剪枝框架，将图元数量和瓣数量的剪枝建模为一个约束优化问题。

Result: MEGS$^{2}$实现了50%的静态VRAM减少和40%的渲染VRAM减少，同时保持了可比的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS$^{2}$通过联合优化图元总数和每个图元的参数，实现了前所未有的内存压缩。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化损失，它强制执行标准高斯性，鼓励样本与标准高斯分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进了一系列涉及文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化的下游任务。

Method: 将高维样本的元素视为一维标准高斯变量，并定义一个组合损失，该组合损失将空间域中基于矩的正则化与频谱域中基于功率谱的正则化相结合。为了确保置换不变性，损失应用于随机置换的输入。

Result: 该正则化优于先前的高斯正则化，有效地防止了奖励黑客并加速了收敛。

Conclusion: 现有的基于高斯性的正则化属于我们的统一框架：一些对应于特定阶数的矩损失，而先前的协方差匹配损失等效于我们的频谱损失，但由于其空间域计算而导致更高的计算时间复杂度。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Conclusion: 通过奖励驱动的优化框架，我们提高了SAM的适应性和性能，使其更好地满足各种分割任务的需求，特别允许实时流数据分割。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为 Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation 的基准，用于评估 AI 生成图像中的社会偏见。他们测试了 13 个 LMM，发现这些模型会系统性地复制并放大职业性别刻板印象，并且存在强烈的默认男性偏见。不同模型之间的偏见程度差异很大，这表明高偏见不是不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMM）彻底改变了文本到图像的生成，但它们可能会延续训练数据中的有害社会偏见。先前的工作已经确定了这些模型中的性别偏见，但方法上的限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。为了解决这一差距，我们引入了 Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation。

Method: 我们使用 75 个程序生成的、性别中立的提示来测试 13 个商业上可用的 LMM，以生成刻板印象为男性、刻板印象为女性和非刻板印象的职业中的人。然后，我们使用经过验证的 LLM 作为评判系统来对 965 张生成的图像的性别表示进行评分。

Result: 我们的结果表明：1) 相对于现实世界的劳动力数据，LMM 不仅系统地复制而且实际上放大了职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板印象职业的图像中生成男性的比例为 93.0%，而在女性刻板印象职业的图像中仅为 22.5%；2) 对于非刻板印象职业，模型表现出强烈的默认男性偏见，生成男性的比例为 68.3%；3) 偏见的程度在不同模型之间差异很大，总体男性代表性从 46.7% 到 73.3% 不等。值得注意的是，表现最佳的模型降低了性别刻板印象，并接近了性别平等，实现了最高的公平性分数。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了迄今为止最全面的性别偏见跨模型基准，并强调了标准化、自动化评估工具对于促进人工智能开发中的问责制和公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种加速多视图重建的方法，通过优化block-sparse kernels来替换密集全局注意力操作，无需重新训练即可提高推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在多视图重建中表现出色，但全局注意力层的二次复杂度限制了其在大型图像集上的扩展性。

Method: 分析全局注意力矩阵，发现概率质量集中在对应于跨视图几何匹配的一小部分patch-patch交互上，并提出基于高度优化的block-sparse kernels的替代方案。

Result: 在多个多视图基准测试中，推理速度提高了4倍，且任务性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，可扩展到VGGT和$\pi^3$，并支持大型图像集合。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VIO边缘服务器卸载趋势容易受到服务器端的攻击，这些攻击会逐渐积累成漂移，并且难以被检测。

Method: 该方法训练了一个模型来学习无攻击会话中的时间规律，从而检测运行时的偏差并恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在真实的卸载VIO环境中，实验结果表明，与没有防御的基线相比，该方法可以显著减少轨迹和姿态误差。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的针对VIO的攻击防御机制，可以在实际应用中提高系统的安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全无监督的方法来确定特定数据集中的新类别，该方法依赖于使用 Vision Transformers 估计聚类数量，并结合流形学习技术来细化这些嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在监督学习中，带注释的数据是基石。然而，为实例提供标签是一项需要大量人力投入的任务。一些关键的现实世界应用程序使事情变得更加复杂，因为无论在感兴趣的任务中可能已经识别出多少标签，都可能出现对应于新类的示例。

Method: 该方法依赖于使用 Vision Transformers 估计聚类数量，Vision Transformers 利用注意力机制来生成向量嵌入。此外，我们结合流形学习技术，通过利用数据的内在几何结构来细化这些嵌入，从而提高整体图像聚类性能。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100 和 Tiny ImageNet 上，我们建立了单模态聚类和新类发现的最新成果。无论是在事先知道或不知道聚类数量的情况下，我们都这样做。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的无监督方法，用于发现图像数据中的新类别，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [60] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet，一种用于精确乳腺超声分割的双提示、双分支多模态模型，提高了小病灶的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割支持可靠的测量、定量分析和下游分类，但对于边缘模糊和散斑噪声的小或低对比度病灶仍然很困难。文本提示可以添加临床背景，但直接应用弱局部文本图像线索往往会产生粗糙、斑点状的响应，除非额外的机制恢复精细边缘。

Method: 提出了 XBusNet，它结合了图像特征与临床文本。一个基于 CLIP Vision Transformer 的全局路径编码以病灶大小和位置为条件的整幅图像语义，而一个局部 U-Net 路径强调精确的边界，并由描述形状、边缘和乳腺影像报告和数据系统 (BI-RADS) 术语的提示进行调节。提示是从结构化元数据自动组装的，无需手动点击。

Result: XBusNet 在 BLU 上实现了最先进的性能，平均 Dice 为 0.8765，IoU 为 0.8149，优于六个强大的基线。小病灶表现出最大的增益，错过的区域更少，虚假激活也更少。

Conclusion: 一种双提示、双分支多模态设计，将全局语义与局部精度相结合，可产生准确的 BUS 分割掩模，并提高小而低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于乳腺癌分类的框架，该框架利用扩散概率模型（DPM）进行数据增强，并融合了深度学习特征和手工设计的非线性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的深度学习受到数据稀缺的阻碍。

Method: 使用扩散概率模型（DPM）进行数据增强，并融合了预训练的ResNet-50的深度特征和从U-Net分割的肿瘤中提取的手工设计的非线性特征（例如，分形维数）。使用XGBoost分类器进行分类。

Result: 该框架实现了98.0％的准确率和98.1％的灵敏度。消融研究和统计测试证实，DPM增强和非线性特征融合都是成功的关键组成部分。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了先进的生成模型和可解释的特征之间的协同作用，可用于创建高度准确的医疗诊断工具。

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

*Ji Xie,Trevor Darrell,Luke Zettlemoyer,XuDong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA是一种资源高效的后训练方法，它利用视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集“文本提示”，提供丰富的监督而无需标题，从而改进统一多模态模型中的生成和编辑保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统一多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但标题通常稀疏且遗漏细粒度的视觉细节。

Method: RecA在自身的视觉理解嵌入上调节UMM，并优化它以通过自监督重建损失重建输入图像，从而重新调整理解和生成。

Result: RecA在GenEval和DPGBench上显着提高了图像生成性能，同时也提高了编辑基准。

Conclusion: RecA超越了更大的开源模型，并广泛应用于不同的UMM架构，从而确立了它作为UMM的一种高效且通用的后训练对齐策略。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 现有的多光谱遥感目标检测方法在低光照、小目标建模和计算复杂性方面存在局限性。

Method: 设计了双域增强模块(DDE)和优先级引导的Mamba融合模块(PGMF)。DDE包含跨尺度小波Mamba (CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)，用于增强低光图像。PGMF引入了优先级扫描的概念，从局部目标特征开始，根据模态差异获得的优先级分数进行融合。

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测方面表现良好，与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的无人机多光谱目标检测方法，可以有效地解决低光照、小目标建模和计算复杂性等挑战。

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，即高斯拓扑细化门控图卷积(G^3CN)，以解决基于骨骼的动作识别中区分模糊动作的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN 在基于骨骼的动作识别中非常有效，但通常难以有效区分模糊动作，揭示了学习到的拓扑和空间特征的表示的局限性。

Method: G^3CN 结合了高斯滤波器来细化骨骼拓扑图，改进了模糊动作的表示。此外，门控循环单元(GRU)被集成到 GCN 框架中，以增强骨骼点之间的信息传播。

Result: 在 NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120 和 NW-UCLA 基准上的大量实验表明，G^3CN 有效地提高了动作识别，特别是对于模糊样本。

Conclusion: G^3CN 有效地提高了动作识别，特别是对于模糊样本。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于解析图的视觉-语言交互（PGVL）方法，用于提升人体姿态估计（HPE）效果。该方法通过引导模块（GM）有效地融合了视觉和语言信息，尤其是在处理遮挡场景时，能够更好地保持局部特征的响应，并利用全局特征推断被遮挡或不可见的部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要集中于单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言可以提供丰富的HPE先验知识，例如遮挡场景中的空间关系。然而，现有的通过全局特征集成的视觉-语言融合方法会削弱遮挡区域的响应，并导致对齐和定位失败。

Method: 该方法首先构建模态特定的解析图，然后使用递归双向交叉注意力机制，并通过GM进行提纯。PGVL包括自顶向下的分解和自底向上的组合两个阶段。

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和所设计的网络。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的基于解析图的视觉-语言交互方法，可以有效地提升人体姿态估计效果，尤其是在处理遮挡场景时。

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

*Ze-Xin Yin,Jiaxiong Qiu,Liu Liu,Xinjie Wang,Wei Sui,Zhizhong Su,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为 Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA) 的新框架，用于统一建模几何体和 PBR 材质，从而实现端到端的 PBR-ready 3D 资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 3D 生成方法大多关注几何建模，要么将纹理烘焙到简单的顶点颜色中，要么将纹理合成留给图像扩散模型的后处理，无法满足对劳动密集型和经验密集的 PBR 材质 3D 资产创建的需求。

Method: 该框架采用模块化设计，包含三个组件：LGAA Wrapper（重用和调整 MV 扩散模型的网络层），LGAA Switcher（对齐多个 LGAA Wrapper 层），以及 LGAA Decoder（预测带有 PBR 通道的 2D Gaussian Splatting）。此外，还引入了专门的后处理程序，以从生成的 2DGS 中有效地提取高质量、可重新照明的网格资产。

Result: 大量的定量和定性实验表明，LGAA 在文本和图像条件下的 MV 扩散模型中均表现出卓越的性能。模块化设计能够灵活地结合多个扩散先验，并且知识保留方案能够实现在仅 69k 多视图实例上进行训练的高效收敛。

Conclusion: LGAA 框架能够有效地生成 PBR-ready 的 3D 资产，并且具有良好的性能和效率。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Motivation: 现有的基准忽略了注视作为用户意图指标的关键作用。为了弥补这一差距，我们引入了EgoGazeVQA。

Method: EgoGazeVQA由MLLM生成的、人工标注员改进的基于注视的QA对组成。通过整合空间、时间和意图相关的线索，我们的注视引导意图提示方法显著提高了性能。

Result: 现有的MLLM难以准确解释用户意图。注视引导的意图提示方法显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了在以自我为中心的环境中，注视对于更个性化和有效的AI助手的价值。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Motivation: 现有的 CVGL 方法通常仅限于单一视图或模态，并且缺乏可解释性，仅仅预测两个图像是否对应，而没有解释匹配背后的原因。

Method: 提出了 GLEAM-C 模型，通过与卫星图像对齐来统一多视图和多模态数据。利用多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 提出了 GLEAM-X 任务，结合跨视图对应预测与可解释的推理。使用 GPT-4o 和 Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro 构建了一个双语基准数据集。

Result: GLEAM-C 模型通过优化实现提高了训练效率，并实现了与现有模型相当的精度。GLEAM-X 任务通过人工修订的测试集，实现了对可解释跨视图推理的系统评估。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OCTA图像获取受限于运动敏感性和设备成本，且现有的深度学习方法忽略了视网膜层之间的血管差异，难以重建复杂的血管细节。

Method: 集成了跨维度监督(CDS)和多尺度特征融合(MSFF)网络，利用分层en-face投影作为监督信号，并结合通道重加权策略进行多尺度特征提取。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上的实验表明，XOCT在en-face投影方面有所改进，这对于视网膜病变的临床评估非常重要。

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Motivation: 目前的森林碳储量监测和评估方法需要提高准确性。

Method: 使用风格迁移方法，引入Swin Transformer，将碳储量估算转化为图像翻译问题。

Result: 在中国云南省曲靖市会泽县进行了实验分析。

Conclusion: 通过注意力机制提取全局特征，提高碳储量估算准确性。

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks
can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate
change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon
stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote
sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation.
However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and
Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in
China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的偏差感知机器卸载(Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning)范式，用于减少视觉模型中的偏差，而无需从头开始重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在安全关键领域（如医学和自动驾驶）中出现偏差或不公平的预测。传统的偏差缓解方法通常需要从头开始重新训练或重新设计数据管道，成本很高。

Method: 该研究建立在保护隐私的卸载技术之上，并评估了各种策略，包括梯度上升、LoRA和Teacher-Student蒸馏。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，事后卸载可以显著减少子群体的差异，在CUB-200上人口均等性提高高达94.86%，在CIFAR-10上提高30.28%，在CelebA上提高97.37%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，机器卸载是增强已部署视觉系统公平性的实用框架，无需完全重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法实现对视频细节的细粒度控制，限制了它们的实际应用性。

Method: 该框架协同集成了视频扩散模型的时间先验和图像扩散模型的重新照明能力，并提出了一种细化投影算法，以确保精确的前景保持。

Result: ANYPORTAL在消费级GPU上实现了高质量的结果。

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL提供了一种实用且高效的视频内容创作和编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of interpretability in deep learning models limits clinical acceptance in radiological image classification.

Method: Splits chest X-ray images into non-overlapping patches, classifies each independently, and aggregates predictions.

Result: Matches EfficientNet-B0's classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908) on CheXpert and improves pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with Grad-CAM) on CheXlocalize.

Conclusion: MedicalPatchNet improves clinical trust by providing explicit, reliable explanations, mitigating shortcut learning risks, and offering a safer AI-assisted diagnostic tool. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is
publicly available with reproducible training and inference scripts and
contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical
imaging domains. We make the code publicly available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，该方法将隐式神经表示与文本到视频扩散模型相结合，用于矢量图形动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矢量图形的动画提供了增强的可理解性和可控性，但通常需要大量的人工工作。为了自动化这个过程。

Method: 采用分层隐式神经表示来重建矢量图形，并使用视频分数蒸馏采样优化神经表示，该采样利用来自预训练文本到视频扩散模型的运动先验。

Result: 实验结果验证了该方法在生成生动自然的矢量图形动画方面的有效性，表明与现有技术相比，该方法在灵活性和动画质量方面都有显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，可以生成生动和自然的矢量图形动画

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Motivation: 传统导航系统在室内效果不佳，因为缺乏精确定位数据。本文旨在提高视障人士的出行便利性和独立性。

Method: 本文集成视觉和语言模型来生成逐步导航指令，并在人工标注的室内导航数据集上使用 Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 对 BLIP-2 模型进行微调。同时，提出了改进的 BERT F1 评估指标，以更全面地衡量导航性能，强调方向和顺序变量。

Result: 应用 LoRA 后，模型在生成方向指令方面显著提高，克服了原始 BLIP-2 模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效改善室内导航，特别是对于视障人士。

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

*Wenzhi Guo,Bing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DiGS的统一框架，将有符号距离场（SDF）学习直接嵌入到3D高斯溅射（3DGS）流程中，从而加强了强且可解释的表面先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）虽然在渲染方面非常有效，但由于表示的非结构化性质和缺乏明确的几何监督，实现准确和完整的表面重建仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过将每个高斯函数与可学习的SDF值相关联，DiGS明确地将图元与底层几何体对齐，并提高跨视图一致性。为了进一步确保密集和连贯的覆盖，我们设计了一种几何引导的网格生长策略，该策略在多尺度层次结构下沿着几何一致的区域自适应地分布高斯函数。

Result: 在包括DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples在内的标准基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，始终提高重建精度和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS是一种将SDF学习嵌入3DGS流程的统一框架，可提高重建精度和完整性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

*Chun Liu,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的对抗攻击框架，通过局部混合和logits优化来提高对抗样本的迁移性，从而增强深度神经网络的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于混合的策略在提高对抗样本的迁移性方面存在局限性，它们要么执行全局混合，要么直接交换图像中的区域，这可能会破坏全局语义特征并误导对抗样本的优化。此外，它们依赖于交叉熵损失进行扰动优化，导致迭代更新期间的梯度消失。

Method: 该论文提出了一种通过局部混合和logits优化实现非目标攻击的新框架。首先，提出了一种局部混合策略来生成多样但语义一致的输入。其次，将目标攻击的logit损失适应于非目标场景，减轻交叉熵损失的梯度消失问题。第三，应用扰动平滑损失来抑制高频噪声并增强可迁移性。

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在6个代理模型上优于12种最先进的方法。值得注意的是，以ResNet作为MTARSI的代理，该方法在黑盒攻击成功率方面平均提高了17.28%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的对抗攻击框架，可以提高对抗样本的迁移性，从而增强深度神经网络的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

TL;DR: MVAT: 利用时序多视角数据，通过Teacher-Student模型和多视角2D投影损失，实现弱监督3D目标检测，缩小与全监督方法的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高，而仅依赖2D框引入投影歧义和视角可见性问题，导致3D框估计困难。

Method: 提出MVAT框架，聚合时序多视角的物体中心点云构建3D表示，使用Teacher-Student蒸馏，Teacher从单视角学习但目标来自时序聚合静态物体，生成高质量伪标签供Student学习，并引入多视角2D投影损失。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo Open数据集上，MVAT取得了弱监督3D目标检测的最佳性能，显著缩小了与全监督方法的差距。

Conclusion: MVAT在不需要任何3D框标注的情况下，实现了最先进的弱监督3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

TL;DR: EHWGesture: A multimodal video dataset for clinical gesture understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack multimodality, multi-view diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and action quality assessment.

Method: A multimodal video dataset with 1,100 recordings from 25 subjects, using RGB-Depth and event cameras, plus motion capture for ground truth.

Result: Baseline experiments show potential for gesture classification, trigger detection, and action quality assessment.

Conclusion: EHWGesture is a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal clinical gesture understanding.

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用少样本控制（UFC）适配器，能够推广到新的空间条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器适应性有限，并且当遇到与训练任务大不相同的新的空间控制条件时，会产生高昂的训练成本。

Method: 利用查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建特定于任务的控制特征，这些特征由匹配机制和对一小组特定于任务的参数的更新来实例化。

Result: 在六个新的空间控制任务上的实验表明，UFC 仅使用 30 个新任务的带注释示例进行微调，即可实现与空间条件一致的细粒度控制。值得注意的是，当使用 0.1% 的完整训练数据进行微调时，UFC 在各种控制任务中实现了与完全监督基线相当的性能。我们还表明，UFC 可以不可知地应用于各种扩散骨干，并证明了其在 UNet 和 DiT 架构上的有效性。

Conclusion: UFC 是一种通用的少样本控制适配器，能够推广到新的空间条件，并在各种扩散骨干上有效。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HU的Foreground Masking方法，用于3D医学图像的MIM预训练任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机掩码忽略了3D医学图像中解剖对象的密度，限制了MIM在医学图像计算中的应用。

Method: 利用HU测量值，专注于内脏器官的强度分布，排除无意义的非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公共3D医学图像数据集上，分割质量和Dice评分均得到持续提高。

Conclusion: 领域中心MIM的重要性，为医学图像分割中的表征学习提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Motivation: 以往方法依赖耗时的GAN反演和测试时优化，缺乏大规模3D头部数据。

Method: 提出了一个粗到精的高斯头部生成流程，利用Transformer模块提取特征并进行形状重建，然后进行高密度化处理。提出了一个双分支框架，有效聚合结构化的球面三平面特征和非结构化的基于点的特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架的有效性优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 该框架仅使用合成数据进行训练，实现了快速重建和渲染。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) 的架构，用于解决3D形状识别任务中深度学习模型的可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学和取证等领域，深度学习模型因其黑盒特性而难以在高风险应用中被信任和采用。针对3D形状识别任务，需要一种可解释的模型。

Method: CGAT利用图注意力卷积和一个内在的注意力机制，通过注意力展开进行可视化，以解释其决策过程。该方法应用于从CBCT图像导出的第三磨牙的3D网格，用于Demirjian阶段分配。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和到质心的距离作为节点特征，可以略微提高性能（0.76 weighted F1 score），并提供更全面的注意力可视化。

Conclusion: CGAT架构生成人类可理解的注意力图的能力可以增强信任，并促进专家对模型决策的验证。CGAT具有广泛的适用性，可以促进透明和有竞争力的深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 当前视觉-语言基础模型(VLM)中的性别偏见评估可能受到图像中虚假特征的影响，导致评估结果不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉-语言基础模型(VLM)中的性别偏见，并考察虚假特征是否会扭曲性别偏见评估。

Method: 通过系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准数据集（COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, PHASE）中的非性别特征，并使用各种VLM来量化这些扰动对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使是最小的扰动（例如，仅屏蔽10%的物体或轻微模糊背景）也会显著改变偏见分数，在生成式VLM中变化高达175%，在CLIP变体中变化高达43%。

Conclusion: 当前的偏见评估可能反映了模型对虚假特征的响应，而不是真正的性别偏见。建议在报告偏见指标时，同时报告特征敏感度测量结果，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数据高效的微调流程，用于调整基于 3D CT 的 Med-VLM，以用于 3D MRI，并展示了其在阿尔茨海默病 (AD) 诊断中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言模型 (Med-VLM) 在报告生成和视觉问答等任务中表现出令人印象深刻的结果，但它们仍然面临一些限制。最值得注意的是，它们未充分利用患者元数据，并且缺乏临床诊断知识的整合。此外，大多数现有模型通常是从头开始训练或在大型 2D 图像-文本对上进行微调，需要大量的计算资源，并且由于缺乏结构信息，它们在 3D 医学成像上的有效性通常受到限制。

Method: 我们将结构化元数据转换为合成报告，丰富文本输入以改进图像-文本对齐。其次，我们添加了一个辅助token，该token经过训练可以预测简易精神状态检查 (MMSE) 分数，这是一种广泛使用的临床认知功能指标，与 AD 严重程度相关。这为微调提供了额外的监督。将轻量级提示调整应用于图像和文本模态。

Result: 我们的方法在使用 1,500 个训练图像的两个 AD 数据集上实现了最先进的性能，优于在 10,000 个图像上进行微调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种数据高效的微调流程，用于调整基于 3D CT 的 Med-VLM，以用于 3D MRI，并在阿尔茨海默病 (AD) 诊断中表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标记数据，且表征缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种新的自监督交叉编码器框架，将学习到的表征解耦为静态表征（受对比学习约束，捕捉稳定的解剖特征）和动态表征（受输入梯度正则化引导，反映时间变化）。

Result: 在 ADNI 数据集上取得了优越的分类精度和改进的可解释性，并在 OASIS 和 PPMI 数据集上表现出强大的零样本和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够提高分类精度和可解释性，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的隐语义水印嵌入方法，该方法通过强制执行 Hermitian 对称性来保持频率完整性，并引入了一种中心感知嵌入策略，该策略通过确保稳健的信息保留来减少语义水印因裁剪攻击而产生的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义水印技术对于潜在扩散模型 (LDM) 的再生攻击具有鲁棒性，但由于频率完整性的损失，通常会遭受检测性能下降的影响。

Method: 提出 Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW)，它通过强制执行 Hermitian 对称性来保持频率完整性。此外，引入了一种中心感知嵌入策略，该策略通过确保稳健的信息保留来减少语义水印因裁剪攻击而产生的脆弱性。

Result: 通过将这些技术应用于现有的语义水印方案，增强了它们在频域结构，从而提高了鲁棒性和检索准确率。大量的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，超过了以前的各种攻击场景。

Conclusion: 提出的 SFW 被证明是平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的有效框架，解决了语义水印中固有的权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，用于解决小运动目标检测问题，该框架与现有方法不同，不依赖于目标特定特征或运动线索，而是在于小目标检测和背景区分是内在耦合的，即使是杂乱的视频背景也通常表现出强大的低秩结构，可以作为稳定的检测先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于低信噪比、模糊的视觉线索和杂乱的背景，小运动目标检测在许多防御应用中至关重要，但也极具挑战性。现有的方法通常依赖于目标特定特征或运动线索，并且在复杂环境中往往缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 我们将任务重新定义为基于张量的低秩和稀疏分解问题，并对背景、目标和噪声分量进行理论分析，以指导模型设计。我们引入了TenRPCANet，这是一种深度神经网络，对目标特征的假设最少。具体来说，我们提出了一种令牌化策略，该策略通过自注意力机制隐式地执行多阶张量低秩先验。这种机制捕获局部和非局部自相似性，以对低秩背景进行建模，而无需依赖显式迭代优化。此外，受张量RPCA中稀疏分量更新的启发，我们设计了一个特征细化模块来增强目标显着性。

Result: 该方法在多帧红外小目标检测和空间物体检测两项截然不同且具有挑战性的任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了我们方法的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 在不确定、复杂和冲突的情况下，多标准决策方法为决策者提供了做出更好决策的工具。模糊集理论主要处理人类思想和认知中固有的不确定性，并试图量化这种不确定性。选择可再生能源是因为从可再生能源满足能源需求、平衡碳排放和缓解全球气候变化的影响是最近一段时间最关键的问题之一。

Method: 该研究利用Fermatean模糊环境，这是一种模糊集的推广。提出了一种基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型，以确定部分已知的特征权重。该方法与区间值Fermatean模糊集相结合。

Result: 将提出的方法应用于选择可再生能源的问题。

Conclusion: 选择可再生能源是一个技术问题，但该问题的管理和政治影响也很重要，并在本研究中进行了讨论。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

Motivation: 将符号推理的可解释性与频谱学习的可扩展性和适应性相结合。

Method: 利用图信号处理 (GSP) 和基于知识图谱拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择滤波器。

Result: 在最先进的推理基准测试（如 ProofWriter 和 CLUTRR）上，Spectral NSR 实现了卓越的准确性、更快的推理、改进的对抗扰动鲁棒性以及更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR 是下一代推理系统的可扩展且有原则的基础，它提供了超越传统方法的透明性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.

Method: Instruction Agent通过提取逐步指令并严格按照用户意图的轨迹执行它们来解决任务。该代理还利用验证器和回溯器模块来提高鲁棒性。

Result: Instruction Agent在一组OSWorld任务上的成功率为60%，而所有顶级代理都未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理和可靠的实际GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的去噪方法，用于从受肌电图 (EMG) 污染的记录中重建干净的皮肤神经活动 (SKNA)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高频心电图 (ECG) 记录中提取的皮肤神经活动 (SKNA) 提供了一个非侵入式窗口来了解交感神经系统 (SNS) 的动态，但其测量非常容易受到肌电图 (EMG) 污染。传统的基于固定范围内带通滤波的预处理容易受到重叠的 EMG 和 SKNA 频谱分量的影响，尤其是在持续的肌肉活动期间。

Method: 使用具有长短期记忆 (LSTM) 瓶颈的轻量级一维卷积自动编码器来重建干净的 SKNA。

Result: 该方法将信噪比提高了高达 9.65 dB，将与干净 SKNA 的互相关从 0.40 增加到 0.72，并将基于突发的 SKNA 特征恢复到接近干净的可辨别性 (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96)。

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的重建可以在大量的 EMG 干扰期间保留生理相关的交感神经爆发，从而可以在自然、运动丰富的环境中实现更强大的 SKNA 监测。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL is a framework that combines Partial-Match Rewards and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to improve reasoning language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods have low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases and complex questions.

Method: It uses two pipelines: (1) a new in-context learning framework with group self-evaluation (verbal-RL), and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL pipeline with a small backbone model.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD. verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4% higher than SOTA, and the CoT pipeline is 1.4% higher.

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic industrial constraints.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有希望在实现高准确率的同时，显著降低引导法律系统用户找到正确问题资源的成本。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

TL;DR: 智能电网通过集成可再生能源和通信技术实现了能源管理的根本转变，但也增加了网络攻击的风险，可能导致隐私泄露和运营中断。本研究提出了一种混合深度学习入侵检测系统 (IDS)，旨在提高智能电网的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能电网协议容易受到未经授权的访问和拒绝服务 (DoS) 等攻击。为了解决这个问题，本研究旨在提高智能电网的安全性。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络 (CNN) 的特征提取能力和长短期记忆 (LSTM) 网络的时序模式识别技能，构建了一个混合深度学习入侵检测系统 (IDS)。使用 DNP3 和 IEC104 入侵检测数据集来训练和测试 CNN-LSTM 模型，以识别和分类潜在的网络威胁。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合深度学习入侵检测系统 (IDS) 能够有效地提高智能电网的安全性，并优于现有的深度学习方法。

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: BlendedNet解决了非常规配置的数据稀缺问题，并支持对气动设计的数据驱动代理建模的研究。

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了小型语言模型（SLM）在移动和可穿戴医疗健康监测中的应用，旨在解决现有基于大型语言模型（LLM）的云端解决方案的隐私、内存和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的医疗健康解决方案存在隐私泄露、内存占用高和延迟大的问题，而小型语言模型（SLM）有望在本地高效运行，但其在医疗健康预测中的性能尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和指令微调方法，系统评估了SLM在健康预测任务中的性能，并将表现最佳的微调SLM部署到移动设备上，以评估其在实际医疗场景中的效率和预测性能。

Result: SLM在效率和隐私方面表现出显著优势，性能可与LLM相媲美。但在处理类别不平衡和少样本场景方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: SLM虽然目前尚不完善，但作为下一代保护隐私的医疗健康监测解决方案，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了中间token生成（ITG）与问题难度之间的关系，发现ITG长度与问题难度相关性不大，更多地取决于问题与训练数据的分布距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨中间token生成（ITG）提升语言模型推理性能的机制，质疑将ITG视为“思考”的拟人化假设，即更长的trace代表更高的计算能力。

Method: 通过从头训练Transformer模型，使用A*搜索算法的推导轨迹，以迷宫问题的操作次数作为问题复杂度的精确度量，评估模型在简单和分布外问题上的表现。

Result: 发现即使对于最简单的任务，模型也会产生过长的推理轨迹，且中间token长度与A*轨迹长度的相关性较低。相关性较高的案例出现在问题更接近训练分布时，表明这源于近似回忆而非真正的自适应计算。

Conclusion: 中间trace生成并非自适应于问题难度，不能简单地将更长的序列视为“思考努力”的指标。

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by AlphaEvolve, extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository scale.

Method: Orchestrates LLM agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving its own evolution policies and rules.

Result: Evolved solvers that decisively outperformed the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both 2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM-based code evolution can be extended to the full repository scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）近年来发展迅速，但这种进步面临着一个根本瓶颈：需要越来越多的数据，模型才能从中继续学习。

Method: 利用自博弈的博弈论框架，其中模型的能力被视为在竞争性游戏中的表现，并通过让模型与自身对战来产生更强的策略——我们称之为语言自博弈（LSP）。

Result: 在指令跟踪基准上使用 Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct 进行的实验表明，预训练模型不仅可以通过自博弈来提高其在具有挑战性的任务中的性能，而且可以比数据驱动的基线更有效地做到这一点。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可以通过自博弈来提高其在具有挑战性的任务中的性能，而且可以比数据驱动的基线更有效地做到这一点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SheetDesigner的零样本、无需训练的框架，该框架使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）结合规则和视觉反射来进行组件放置和内容填充，以自动生成电子表格布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动布局模型不适用于电子表格，因为它们忽略了电子表格固有的离散网格结构和相互关联的语义，如数据依赖和上下文链接。

Method: 1. Formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. 2. introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision reflection for component placement and content population.

Result: SheetDesigner的性能比五个基线至少高出22.6%。

Conclusion: 通过视觉模态，MLLM在处理重叠和平衡方面表现良好，但在对齐方面存在困难，因此需要混合规则和视觉反射策略。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Conclusion: 我们旨在展示神经符号方法如何弥合黑盒预测模型与工业物联网支持的网络物理系统中复杂动态环境中的关键决策支持需求之间的差距。

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的prompt注入攻击框架，该框架利用激活引导来提高攻击的跨模型迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的白盒/灰盒方法不实用，黑盒方法迁移性差，因此需要新的方法。

Method: 构建一个基于能量的模型（EBM），使用来自代理模型的激活来评估对抗性prompt的质量。在训练好的EBM的指导下，我们采用token-level的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）采样来自适应地优化对抗性prompt，从而实现无梯度的黑盒攻击。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法具有卓越的跨模型迁移性，在五个主流LLM上实现了49.6%的攻击成功率（ASR），并且比人工设计的prompt提高了34.6%，并在未见过的任务场景中保持了36.6%的ASR。

Conclusion: 激活和攻击有效性之间存在相关性，突出了语义模式在可转移漏洞利用中的关键作用。

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在组织中的应用潜力巨大，但可能产生不良内容。现有的AI对齐研究未能充分解决组织采用者与黑盒LLM之间的信息不对称问题，也未充分考虑组织AI采用过程。

Result: 研究结果包括：(1) 针对组织LLM采用过程中的AI对齐方法，提供了扩展的文献分析过程；(2) 提供了首个LLM对齐问题-解决方案空间。

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为解决组织采用LLM时的AI对齐问题提供了一个新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog: A new neurosymbolic framework extending ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates for multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeSy frameworks have limitations in modeling complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures like graphs.

Method: Extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates, enabling multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning and treating symbolic representations as graphs for GNN processing.

Result: Demonstrates effective capture of complex relational dependencies on tasks in planning, knowledge graph completion, and GNN expressivity.

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible framework for neural-symbolic integration, broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to graph-structured domains.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反馈触发再生 (FTR) 的新框架，该框架结合了用户反馈和增强的解码动态，以解决大型语言模型 (LLM) 在推理过程中生成不正确内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在各种任务中都取得了显著的性能，但它们在推理过程中容易生成不正确的内容，这仍然是一个关键的未解决的挑战。虽然自我纠正方法提供了潜在的解决方案，但它们的有效性受到两个固有局限性的阻碍：(1) 缺乏用于错误定位的可靠指导信号，以及 (2) 传统下一个令牌解码范例施加的受限推理深度。

Method: 本文提出反馈触发再生 (FTR)，这是一种新颖的框架，它将用户反馈与增强的解码动态相结合。具体来说，FTR 仅在收到负面用户反馈后才激活响应再生，从而避免了来自错误自我评估的错误传播，同时保留了最初正确的输出。此外，我们还引入了长期多路径 (LTM) 解码，它可以通过延迟序列评估来系统地探索多个推理轨迹，从而有效地克服了标准下一个令牌预测的短视决策特性。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准上的大量实验表明，我们的框架比最先进的基于提示的自我纠正方法取得了持续和显着的改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的框架，该框架结合了用户反馈和增强的解码动态，以解决大型语言模型 (LLM) 在推理过程中生成不正确内容的问题。实验结果表明，该框架比最先进的基于提示的自我纠正方法取得了持续和显着的改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

### [113] [RIMO: An Easy-to-Evaluate, Hard-to-Solve Olympiad Benchmark for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07711)
*Ziye Chen,Chengwei Qin,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Olympiad-level reasoning, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by using unique integer answers or step-by-step proof evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate LLMs, and Olympiad-level benchmarks have grading noise and potential bias.

Method: The authors created RIMO, a two-track benchmark: RIMO-N (rewritten IMO problems with unique integer answers) and RIMO-P (proof problems with expert-checked solutions and step-by-step evaluation).

Result: LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, perform poorly on RIMO compared to older benchmarks, revealing a gap in Olympiad-level reasoning.

Conclusion: RIMO provides a challenging and easy-to-evaluate benchmark for future research, highlighting the need to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

*Bo Yu,Zhixiu Hua,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究旨在利用肠道微生物群作为生物标志物，通过深度学习模型提高帕金森病早期预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的帕金森病诊断主要依赖临床评级，误诊率高。肠道菌群与帕金森病存在关联，有潜力作为生物标志物。现有的深度学习模型忽略了菌株间的相关性和时间动态性，需要更强大的特征提取方法。

Method: 1. 收集帕金森病患者及其健康配偶的肠道菌群数据，以识别差异丰度的分类群。
2. 开发了一种名为RFRE（随机森林结合递归特征消除）的创新特征选择框架，整合生态知识以增强生物可解释性。
3. 设计了一种混合分类模型，以捕获微生物群数据中的时间和空间模式。

Result: 论文中没有提及。

Conclusion: 论文中没有提及。

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

*Mustafa Kaan Aslan,Reinout Heijungs,Filip Ilievski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用知识增强AI技术估算食品碳足迹的方法，并通过聊天机器人界面与用户交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费者、生产者和政策制定者都关注环境可持续性，特别是与气候变化相关的可持续性。碳足迹是量化活动对气候变化贡献的标准指标，通常使用生命周期评估 (LCA) 进行评估。然而，由于不透明和全球供应链以及分散的数据，进行 LCA 非常复杂。

Method: 结合LCA和公开数据库的进展，以及知识增强AI技术，包括检索增强生成，来估计食品产品的碳足迹。

Result: 引入了一个聊天机器人界面，允许用户交互式地探索复合膳食的碳影响，并将结果与熟悉的活动联系起来。

Conclusion: 一个实时网络演示展示了我们的概念验证系统，其中包含任意食物项目和后续问题，突出了以可访问的格式提供 LCA 见解的潜力和局限性——例如数据库不确定性和 AI 误解。

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

### [116] [Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking Budget Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07820)
*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR) 的新方法，该方法通过 critic 模型评估推理的置信度，自适应地平衡了效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型 (LRLM) 在解决复杂任务方面具有潜力，但推理 token 的数量是预先定义的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了 CGR。

Method: CGR 方法受到生成对抗网络中生成器/判别器框架的启发。critic 模型会定期探测自己的推理，以评估是否已达到确信的结论。如果未达到，则继续推理，直到满足目标确定性阈值。

Result: 在 AIME2024 和 AIME2025 数据集上的实验表明，CGR 提高了基线准确率，同时减少了 token 的使用。CGR 是稳定的，减少了种子之间的差异，提高了类似考试的性能。CGR 可以消除数百万个 token，并在确定性阈值和效率之间进行权衡。

Conclusion: CGR 通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信赖性和资源效率，为在准确性和计算成本都很重要的领域中的实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在课堂问答场景下，利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术提高大型语言模型（LLM）的可靠性。比较了向量检索和图检索两种RAG范式，并提出了动态分支框架以优化检索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比研究未能充分考虑教育学科、问题类型和实际部署成本等教学因素。本文旨在为教育工作者和系统设计者提供在学习环境中有效集成RAG增强LLM的可行指导。

Method: 构建了一个包含3176个跨学科问题的EduScopeQA数据集，用于评估不同教育查询类型的性能。同时，利用系统性更改的教科书数据集来评估系统与语料库完整性的一致性。

Result: OpenAI Vector Search RAG在快速事实检索方面表现良好，GraphRAG Global擅长提供教学上丰富的答案，GraphRAG Local在处理密集、更改的教科书时准确率最高。动态分支框架可以提高保真度和效率。

Conclusion: 通过动态路由查询到最优检索方法，可以有效提升RAG在教育场景下的应用效果，为教育工作者和系统设计者提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种迭代自蒸馏方法，以低成本地将小规模开源LLM转化为强大的代码指令数据合成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖于从专有LLM中提取的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本高昂。本文旨在探索小规模开源LLM作为高质量代码指令数据合成器的潜力。

Method: 该方法通过在少量来自专有LLM的优质数据合成样本上训练来增强小规模LLM的数据合成能力，并设计了多检查点抽样和多方面评分策略进行初始数据选择，以及基于梯度的影响估计方法进行最终数据过滤。

Result: 基于小规模合成器生成的代码指令数据集，开发了SCoder模型，实现了最先进的代码生成能力。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了所提出方法的有效性，能够以较低的成本构建高性能的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CP-Model-Zoo的辅导系统，该系统通过用户对组合问题的自然语言描述，从数据库中检索最接近的源代码模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束编程建模语言复杂，全局约束数量庞大，创建良好模型需要技巧，阻碍了非专业人士使用CP来解决组合问题。

Method: CP-Model-Zoo利用多年积累的专家编写的模型，通过用户对组合问题的自然语言描述，从数据库中检索最接近的源代码模型。

Result: 实验表明，基于用户输入的、模拟不同专业水平的问题描述，该系统在检索正确模型方面表现出极好的准确性。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo系统能够有效地检索到专家验证的模型，同时消除了人工数据标记的需要。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiPhO is a new benchmark for high school physics Olympiads designed for human-aligned evaluation of (M)LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics benchmarks lack systematic coverage of real-world competitions and direct comparison with humans.

Method: The HiPhO benchmark includes 13 recent Olympiad exams, official marking schemes for fine-grained grading, and medal assignments based on human thresholds.

Result: Evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows a performance gap between open-source models and top students, strong reasoning capabilities in closed-source models, and room for improvement.

Conclusion: HiPhO is a rigorous, human-aligned benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在AI系统中，偏好满意度是否可以作为一种可经验测量的福利指标。

Method: 通过在虚拟环境中导航和选择对话主题来测量模型的行为偏好，并测试成本和奖励如何影响行为。

Result: 观察到模型在陈述偏好和行为之间存在显著的相关性，但不同模型和条件下的一致性有所不同，对扰动的反应也不一致。

Conclusion: 目前尚不确定这些方法是否成功衡量了语言模型的福利状态，但研究结果突出了在语言模型中进行福利测量的可行性，并邀请进一步探索。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计数查询中存在输出准确性和查询总数限制，并且返回的计数不保持嵌套查询的总顺序。

Method: 利用sigma-algebra的概念构建保护隐私的计数查询。

Result: 提出的概念和方法可以显著提高输出准确性，同时在大量查询存在下保持所需的隐私级别。

Conclusion: 该技术可以应用于解决大型和随时间变化的数据集。

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

Result: 在合成医疗保健风格数据库上的实验表明，该系统能够在模糊化的列名和部分值不匹配的情况下恢复有效连接。

Conclusion: 该研究在数据集成方面具有直接的应用。

Abstract: Traditional relational databases require users to manually specify join keys
and assume exact matches between column names and values. In practice, this
limits joinability across fragmented or inconsistently named tables. We propose
a fuzzy join framework that automatically identifies joinable column pairs and
traverses indirect (multi-hop) join paths across multiple databases. Our method
combines column name similarity with row-level fuzzy value overlap, computes
edge weights using negative log-transformed Jaccard scores, and performs join
path discovery via graph traversal. Experiments on synthetic healthcare-style
databases demonstrate the system's ability to recover valid joins despite
fuzzified column names and partial value mismatches. This research has direct
applications in data integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏系统的研究使得难以理解 FANNS 算法的相对优势和劣势。此外，FANNS 算法具有耦合的、数据集相关的参数，导致有偏差的比较。关键的影响因素很少被系统地分析，不清楚每个算法何时表现良好。不一致的数据集、工作负载和有偏差的实验设计使得跨算法的比较不可靠。

Method: 该论文提出了一个分类法（将方法分为 filter-then-search、search-then-filter、hybrid-search）和一个系统的评估框架，集成了统一的参数调整和跨算法的标准化过滤，以减少实施引起的性能变化并反映核心权衡。

Result: 该论文进行了一项全面的实证研究，以分析查询难度和数据集属性如何影响性能，评估在过滤选择性、Recall@k 和可扩展性等压力下的稳健性，以阐明每种方法的优势。

Conclusion: 该论文建立了一个标准化的基准，包含真实世界的数据集和开源相关资源，以确保可重复的未来研究。

Abstract: For a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and structured label $f$, the goal of
Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) algorithms is to find
top-$k$ points closest to a query that satisfy label constraints, while
ensuring both recall and QPS (Queries Per Second). In recent years, many FANNS
algorithms have been proposed. However, the lack of a systematic investigation
makes it difficult to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.
Additionally, we found that: (1) FANNS algorithms have coupled,
dataset-dependent parameters, leading to biased comparisons. (2) Key impact
factors are rarely analyzed systematically, leaving unclear when each algorithm
performs well. (3) Disparate datasets, workloads, and biased experiment designs
make cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable. Thus, a comprehensive survey and
benchmark for FANNS is crucial to achieve the following goals: designing a fair
evaluation and clarifying the classification of algorithms, conducting in-depth
analysis of their performance, and establishing a unified benchmark. First, we
propose a taxonomy (dividing methods into \textit{filter-then-search},
\textit{search-then-filter}, \textit{hybrid-search}) and a systematic
evaluation framework, integrating unified parameter tuning and standardized
filtering across algorithms to reduce implementation-induced performance
variations and reflect core trade-offs. Then, we conduct a comprehensive
empirical study to analyze how query difficulty and dataset properties impact
performance, evaluating robustness under pressures like filter selectivity,
Recall@k, and scalability to clarify each method's strengths. Finally, we
establish a standardized benchmark with real-world datasets and open-source
related resources to ensure reproducible future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的神经符号框架，通过在推理时调整用户侧知识图谱（KG）来缓解基于LLM的推荐系统中的过度个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于LLM的推荐系统中，过度个性化会导致算法过滤气泡，限制内容多样性。为了解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法重构用户的个性化知识图谱（PKG），抑制强化个性化信息环境（PIE）的特征共现模式。然后，使用这些调整后的PKG来构建结构化提示，引导语言模型生成更多样化、超出PIE的推荐，同时保持主题相关性。此外，还引入了一系列符号适应策略，包括软重加权、硬反转和有偏三元组的定向删除，以及一种客户端学习算法，用于优化每个用户的应用。

Result: 在食谱推荐基准上的实验表明，个性化的PKG调整显著提高了内容的新颖性，同时保持了推荐质量，优于全局调整和基于提示的朴素方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的神经符号框架，可以缓解LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，提高推荐内容的多样性。

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard

### [127] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 的新方法，通过直接根据重排序器的偏好检索文档来绕过传统检索-重排序流程的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-重排序流程受限于初始检索质量和LLM重排序器不断增长的计算需求。

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法在近似图上进行贪婪搜索，根据文档相似性策略性地优先排序有希望的文档以进行重排序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出显著的性能改进：BRIGHT 上 3.5 分，FollowIR 上 2.9 分，M-BEIR 上 5.1 分，所有这些都在 100 篇文档的有限重排序预算内。

Conclusion: 在给定的嵌入和重排序模型对的情况下，策略性地选择要重排序的文档可以显著提高有限重排序预算下的检索准确率。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

### [128] [Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253)
*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个多样且真实的复杂检索任务集，并评估了一系列先进的检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索模型在处理复杂检索任务时能力不足，缺乏用于评估模型在多样化复杂任务上能力的资源，且现有资源范围有限，缺乏真实性。

Method: 构建一个多样且真实的复杂检索任务集，并评估一系列先进的检索模型。同时，探索基于LLM的查询扩展和重写对检索质量的影响。

Result: 即使是最好的模型在所有任务上的平均nDCG@10也仅为0.346，R@100仅为0.587。虽然LLM增强可以帮助较弱的模型，但最强的模型在使用所有重写技术时，所有指标的性能都有所下降。

Conclusion: 检索模型在复杂检索任务中表现不佳，LLM增强对最强模型没有帮助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

TL;DR: 创建包含敏感度标签的数据集，以评估个性化AI系统的潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化AI系统可能会使用户接触到敏感或有害内容，从而对幸福感产生负面影响。为了量化这种影响，需要带有相关敏感度标签的数据集。

Method: 整合MovieLens评级数据与“Does the Dog Die？”社区评级网站的内容警告，并结合同人小说互动数据和来自Archive of Our Own的用户生成警告。

Result: 创建了两个新数据集，其中包含敏感度标签分类以及用户内容评级。

Conclusion: 新数据集的创建可以帮助研究人员评估个性化系统，而不仅仅是参与度指标。

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Haimin Zhang,Li Wang,Yongze Wang,Qiang Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于经验回放的增量学习框架MEGG，以解决推荐系统中用户偏好演变的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐系统在静态环境下训练，忽略了用户偏好的动态变化。现有的增量学习方法在推荐任务中面临数据稀疏性和任务范式差异的挑战。

Method: 提出了MEGG框架，该框架使用GGscore来量化样本的影响力，并选择性地回放高影响力的样本以减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在三个神经模型和四个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGG框架优于现有技术水平，并具有良好的可扩展性、效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MEGG框架能够有效地解决推荐系统中用户偏好演变的问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

### [131] [Multi-view-guided Passage Reranking with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07485)
*Jeongwoo Na,Jun Kwon,Eunseong Choi,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MVP的新型段落重排序模型，该模型是一种非生成LLM重排序方法，可将查询段落信息编码为不同的视图嵌入，而不会受到外部偏差的影响。它在单次解码中直接计算相关性得分，并且计算效率很高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的方法在段落重排序任务中面临效率和对外部偏差的敏感性方面的挑战。现有模型主要依靠自回归生成和滑动窗口策略来对段落进行排序，这会随着段落数量的增加而导致大量的计算开销。外部偏差（例如位置或选择偏差）会妨碍模型准确表示段落并增加输入顺序敏感性的能力。

Method: MVP是一种非生成LLM重排序方法，它将查询段落信息编码为不同的视图嵌入，而不会受到外部偏差的影响。对于每个视图，它结合了查询感知的段落嵌入来生成不同的锚向量，然后使用该向量在单个解码步骤中直接计算相关性得分。此外，它还采用正交损失来使视图更具特色。

Result: MVP仅使用2.2亿个参数即可与更大的70亿参数微调模型的性能相匹配，同时推理延迟降低了100倍。值得注意的是，MVP的30亿参数变体在领域内和领域外基准测试中均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MVP模型在效率和准确性方面都优于现有方法，为段落重排序任务提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based
methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.
(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window
strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the
number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or
selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and
increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking
(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes
query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced
by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings
to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute
relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an
orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of
much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in
inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Zheng Dou,Deqing Wang,Fuzhen Zhuang,Jian Ren,Yanlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的科学文档表示学习方法，名为FLeW，它统一了三种现有方法的优点，以获得更好的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用引文结构信号、生成细粒度表示和任务感知学习方面面临挑战。

Method: 该方法利用引文意图和频率来增强引文结构信号，并使用领域泛化的分面划分来促进细粒度表示学习。然后，采用简单的权重搜索来适应性地将三个分面级嵌入集成到任务特定的文档嵌入中，无需任务感知的微调。

Result: 实验表明，与之前的模型相比，FLeW 在多个科学任务和领域中具有适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLeW 是一种有效且通用的科学文档表示学习方法。

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

*Rui Dong,Wentao Ouyang,Xiangzheng Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ELEC的高效LLM驱动的点击率预测框架，旨在结合传统CTR预测模型和大型语言模型（LLM）的优点，实现协作、语义和效率的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTR预测模型在表格数据中捕获协作信号，但损失了文本中的语义信息。LLM擅长理解文本的上下文和含义，但在捕获协作信号方面面临挑战，并且推理延迟较长。

Method: ELEC框架首先调整LLM以适应CTR预测任务，然后利用伪孪生网络（包含增益网络和普通网络）来提高效率。增益网络将LLM生成的高级表示向量注入到协作CTR模型中，而普通网络则通过知识蒸馏从增益网络学习，仅使用表格数据作为输入。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，ELEC在CTR预测方面具有有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ELEC是一种模型无关的方法，可以与各种现有的LLM和协作CTR模型集成。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online
advertising systems. On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture
the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but
they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)
excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face
challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference
latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models
and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is
an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for
the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but
simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which
contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level
representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to
form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling
and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency.
We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on
both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla
network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable
performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for
the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ELEC for CTR prediction.

further aim to catalyze a collaborative effort to build reliable and

Abstract: The proliferation of long-form documents presents a fundamental challenge to
information retrieval (IR), as their length, dispersed evidence, and complex
structures demand specialized methods beyond standard passage-level techniques.
This survey provides the first comprehensive treatment of long-document
retrieval (LDR), consolidating methods, challenges, and applications across
three major eras. We systematize the evolution from classical lexical and early
neural models to modern pre-trained (PLM) and large language models (LLMs),
covering key paradigms like passage aggregation, hierarchical encoding,
efficient attention, and the latest LLM-driven re-ranking and retrieval
techniques. Beyond the models, we review domain-specific applications,
specialized evaluation resources, and outline critical open challenges such as
efficiency trade-offs, multimodal alignment, and faithfulness. This survey aims
to provide both a consolidated reference and a forward-looking agenda for
advancing long-document retrieval in the era of foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索需要弥合短查询和不断发展的语料库之间的差距，查询扩展是缓解词汇不匹配的关键机制。

Method: 该综述从四个维度构建了查询扩展框架，并从模型类型和实际应用三个角度综合了该领域。

Result: 该研究提炼了设计基础和交互、对齐/提炼以及知识图约束，作为解决主题漂移和幻觉的有效方法。比较了传统查询扩展与基于PLM/LLM的方法，并映射了在不同领域的应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为在实际约束下选择和组合查询扩展技术提供了一个原则性蓝图，并提出了关于质量控制、成本感知调用、领域/时间适应、超越最终任务指标的评估以及公平性/隐私的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) must bridge short, ambiguous queries and
ever more diverse, rapidly evolving corpora. Query Expansion (QE) remains a key
mechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted
markedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models
(LLMs). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a
four-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection
(explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases,
model-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to
knowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only, instruction-tuned, and
domain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for
QE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot
reasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE
helps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion
with PLM/LLM-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications
across web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational
and code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design
grounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG
constraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude
with an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal
adaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy.
Collectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and
combining QE techniques under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Effectively managing intellectual property is a significant challenge.
Traditional methods for patent analysis depend on labor-intensive manual
searches and rigid keyword matching. These approaches are often inefficient and
struggle to reveal the complex relationships hidden within large patent
datasets, hindering strategic decision-making. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce KLIPA, a novel framework that leverages a knowledge graph and a
large language model (LLM) to significantly advance patent analysis. Our
approach integrates three key components: a structured knowledge graph to map
explicit relationships between patents, a retrieval-augmented generation(RAG)
system to uncover contextual connections, and an intelligent agent that
dynamically determines the optimal strategy for resolving user queries. We
validated KLIPA on a comprehensive, real-world patent database, where it
demonstrated substantial improvements in knowledge extraction, discovery of
novel connections, and overall operational efficiency. This combination of
technologies enhances retrieval accuracy, reduces reliance on domain experts,
and provides a scalable, automated solution for any organization managing
intellectual property, including technology corporations and legal firms,
allowing them to better navigate the complexities of strategic innovation and
competitive intelligence.

Conclusion: 该框架为使用来自商业可穿戴设备的稀疏数据进行个性化睡眠预测提供了一种稳健、自适应且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

Motivation: 现有图SSL方法在跨数据集迁移能力方面探索不足，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练。

Method: 构建了GSTBench基准，并在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估了五个代表性的SSL方法。

Result: 大多数图SSL方法难以泛化，甚至不如随机初始化，而GraphMAE表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 分析了导致差异的根本因素，为未来可迁移图SSL的研究提供指导，并为图学习中的“预训练-然后-迁移”范例奠定基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

*Zehua Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个配置优先的框架，用于评估深度学习系统中跨后端兼容性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化和缓解深度学习中跨后端漂移

Method: 使用YAML解耦实验与代码，支持库和存储库模型，并采用三层验证协议

Result: 72.0% 的运行通过，检测模型和编译的后端特别容易出现漂移

Conclusion: 确定性适配器和选择性回退可以显着提高一致性，且不会造成明显的性能损失

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的主动学习代理模型方法能够有效地解决高维可靠性分析问题，并在计算效率和预测精度方面表现出色。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

*Zirui Li,Bin Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多步公共交通车辆到达时间预测方法，名为非平稳ATP (NSATP)，该方法通过序列平稳化和非平稳效应恢复两个阶段，在可预测性和非平稳性之间进行权衡，从而提高预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的到达时间预测方法通过标准化消除时间序列中的非平稳性，但可能会掩盖非平稳性中固有的有用特征，从而导致过度平稳化。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：序列平稳化和非平稳效应恢复。在后者中，NSATP将最先进的方法从一维扩展到二维模型，以捕获时间序列中隐藏的周期性，并通过学习原始数据的缩放和移位因子来设计过度平稳化的补偿模块。

Result: 在德累斯顿的125天公共交通运营数据上进行了验证。实验结果表明，与基线方法相比，所提出的NSATP可以降低有轨电车的RMSE、MAE和MAPE分别降低2.37%、1.22%和2.26%，公共汽车的RMSE、MAE和MAPE分别降低1.72%、0.60%和1.17%。

Conclusion: 提出的NSATP方法可以在可预测性和非平稳性之间取得平衡，从而提高多步到达时间预测的准确性。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLFactory是一个用于多轮工具使用的强化学习后训练框架，旨在提高大型语言模型与外部工具交互的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基本推理方面表现出色，但在需要与外部工具交互的任务中表现不佳。

Method: RLFactory通过一个基于asyncio的异步调用器和一个解耦的工具/训练架构来解决工具调用稳定性和适应性问题，并通过支持基于规则、模型判断和工具验证信号的奖励层来满足不同的评估需求。它通过引入来自工具反馈的观察标记来重建MDP，实现模型、工具和环境之间的闭环，并实现生成-解析-调用-更新的工作流程以进行动态策略优化。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B上，RLFactory在Natural Questions（NQ）数据集上实现了0.486的测试分数，超过了使用类似技术训练的更大模型（例如，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO，分数为0.473），并将训练吞吐量提高了6.8倍。

Conclusion: RLFactory提供了一个低门槛、高度适应性的框架，用于加强LLM在实际场景中多轮工具的使用。

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable
framework for strengthening multi-round tool use of LLMs in real-world
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Simple-Efficient/RL-Factory.

*Xiaomeng Hu,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin,Tsung-Yi Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为CARE的新框架，用于在解码时确保大型语言模型的输出安全， 旨在解决现有方法中安全性和质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地部署在实际应用中，确保其解码时的输出安全至关重要。现有的解码时干预方法在安全性和响应质量之间存在严重的权衡。

Method: 该框架集成了三个关键组件：(1) 用于实时安全监控的守卫模型，能够检测潜在的不安全内容；(2) 带有令牌缓冲区的回滚机制，可以在早期阶段有效地纠正不安全输出，而不会中断用户体验；(3) 一种新颖的基于内省的干预策略，模型生成对其先前输出的自我反思性批评，并将这些反思纳入上下文以指导后续解码步骤。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在安全性、质量和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，实现了较低的有害响应率和对用户体验的最小中断，同时保持了较高的响应质量。

Conclusion: CARE框架通过使用其守卫模型进行精确干预，使用其回滚机制进行及时纠正，以及使用其新颖的内省方法进行有效自我纠正，从而实现了卓越的安全性-质量权衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架FediLoRA，用于解决异构LoRA秩和缺失模态下的联邦多模态微调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法通常假设统一的秩配置和单模态输入，忽略了异构客户端资源和多模态数据设置中潜在的模态缺失这两个关键的现实挑战。

Method: 提出了一个维度聚合策略，该策略在聚合期间重新加权LoRA更新，且不稀释信息。同时包括一个轻量级的层编辑方法，选择性地合并全局参数以修复局部组件。

Result: 在三个多模态基准数据集上的实验结果表明，FediLoRA在全球和个性化设置中均优于baselines，尤其是在存在模态不完整的情况下。

Conclusion: FediLoRA在异构LoRA秩和缺失模态的联邦多模态微调中表现出色

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于监督机器学习的校准器，用于从流行病时间序列反向映射到 SIR 参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于智能体的流行病模型校准计算量大。

Method: 使用三层双向 LSTM，输入 60 天的发病率、人口规模和恢复率，输出传播概率、接触率和 R0。训练使用复合损失，其中包含一个流行病学驱动的损失，鼓励 R0 * 恢复率等于传播概率 * 接触率。

Result: 在 1000 种情景的模拟研究中，该方法在所有目标上均实现了较低的误差 (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; 传播 0.0715 vs 0.128; 接触 1.02 vs 4.24)，产生更严格的预测区间，接近标称覆盖率，并将每次校准的挂钟时间从 77.4 秒减少到 2.35 秒。

Conclusion: 该方法比 ABC 更忠实地再现了流行病曲线，从而实现了快速且实用的校准。

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Conclusion: 本文提出的DRL调度模型在解决FJSP问题上具有竞争力，并为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新型神经网络层和模型，它只使用单比特参数，从而大大减少了内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型神经网络模型（特别是语言模型和基础图像模型）的规模不断增大，给部署带来了挑战，因此需要减少内存需求并提高计算效率。

Method: 开发了一种新型神经网络层，称为二值归一化层，该层的所有参数（包括内核权重和偏差）只有零或一的值。为了验证二值归一化层的有效性，配置了两个不同的模型来解决多类图像分类问题和预测序列的下一个token的语言解码器。

Conclusion: 二值归一化层为具有减少的内存需求的大型神经网络模型开辟了一个新时代，这些模型可以使用简单且廉价的硬件（例如移动设备或仅 CPU）进行部署。

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Conclusion: 提出了一种线性PASFA的递归扩展，用于更有效地推断慢特征。

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Motivation: 在不确定性下进行序贯决策时，贝叶斯范式提供了 принципиальные 工具，但它依赖于所有参数的概率模型，这可能会妨碍复杂结构约束的结合。

Method: 通过剖面似然消除 nuisance 参数，剖面似然可以自然地处理约束。作为一个直接的实例化，我们开发了一种 MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS) 算法。

Result: 我们的框架适用于结构化问题，包括连续臂 Lipschitz bandits 和动态定价。它还为经典的凸优化算法（如重心法和椭球法）提供了概率视角。我们进一步分析了多臂 bandits 的 MINTS，并建立了接近最优的遗憾保证。

Conclusion: MINTS 算法在多臂 bandits 问题上实现了接近最优的遗憾保证，并且适用于结构化问题，为凸优化算法提供了概率视角。

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Motivation: 研究动机在于提升经济政策的制定和预测的稳健性，通过结合因果结构学习和概率语言模型来实现。

Method: 采用LPCMCI框架与高斯过程距离相关（GPDC）方法，挖掘1970年至2021年美国四个关键宏观经济指标（GDP、经济增长、通货膨胀和失业率）季度数据中的动态因果关系。利用Chronos框架，对失业率进行zero-shot预测。

Result: 结果表明，经济增长与GDP之间存在稳健的单向因果关系，通货膨胀的连接性有限，失业率表现出很强的自回归依赖性。对失业率的预测在提前一到两个季度时是准确的，并且模型的不确定性感知预测产生了90%的置信区间，能够通过统计偏差分析进行有效的异常检测。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了结合因果结构学习与概率语言模型在经济政策制定和增强预测稳健性方面的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Motivation: 在能源基础设施应用中，人工智能光伏监控面临可解释性障碍，限制了应用。深度学习在热故障检测中精度高，但缺乏模型决策与热物理原理一致性的验证。

Method: 系统比较了卷积神经网络（ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉Transformer（ViT-Tiny、Swin-Tiny）在热光伏故障检测中的应用，使用XRAI显著性分析来评估与热物理原理的一致性。

Result: Swin Transformer实现了最高的性能（94%的二元精度；73%的多类精度）。XRAI分析表明，模型学习了有意义的物理特征，例如电池缺陷的局部热点，二极管故障的线性热路径，以及植被阴影的热边界，这与预期的热特征一致。电气故障的检测效果较好（F1分数>0.90），而环境因素（如污垢）仍然具有挑战性（F1分数0.20-0.33）。

Conclusion: 基于热物理的解释性方法为验证能源监控应用中的人工智能决策提供了方法，解决了可再生能源基础设施中的部署障碍。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

TL;DR: lmKANs are introduced as a replacement for linear layers in deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional linear mappings dominate the parameter count and computational cost of modern deep-learning models.

Method: Expresses a general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions implemented as spline lookup tables.

Result: lmKANs reduce inference FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs. Achieves 10x higher H100 throughput at equal accuracy on a tabular-like dataset. CNNs using lmKANs cut inference FLOPs by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k, respectively.

Conclusion: lmKANs deliver a substantially better trade-off between capacity and inference cost.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

### [155] [Riemannian Batch Normalization: A Gyro Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07115)
*Ziheng Chen,Xiao-Jun Wu,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为GyroBN的黎曼批量归一化框架，适用于陀螺群，并适用于机器学习中的多个几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的归一化层对流形上的数据不适用，而机器学习中的许多黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，可以将欧几里得神经网络扩展到非欧几里得域。

Method: 提出了满足伪约简和陀螺等距回旋两个必要条件的GyroBN框架，以保证对样本统计的理论控制。

Result: 在包括格拉斯曼流形、五个恒定曲率空间和相关流形在内的七个代表性几何结构上进行了实验，证明了GyroBN的有效性。

Conclusion: GyroBN框架在多个几何结构上表现出有效性，并为黎曼流形上的深度学习提供了一种新的归一化方法。

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at
https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/GyroBN.git.

TL;DR: TabGFM: 使用表格基础模型进行图学习，将节点分类转化为表格问题，通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格，应用多个表格基础模型进行预测，并通过集成选择聚合它们的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型在代表真实世界图的数据集上训练不足，限制了它们的泛化性能。表格基础模型在表格预测任务和其他领域表现出色。因此，将节点分类重新定义为表格问题。

Method: TabGFM框架：将图转换为表格，应用多个表格基础模型到不同的子样本表格，并通过集成选择聚合它们的输出。

Result: TabGFM在28个真实世界数据集上取得了优于特定任务的GNN和最先进的图基础模型的一致性改进。

Conclusion: 表格重构具有可扩展和泛化图学习的潜力。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化Transformer Circuits (TCs)一致性的方法，以判断其是否可信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏一种正式的、单次通过的方法来量化活跃电路是否表现出连贯性，从而判断其是否可信。

Method: 提出了Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS)，它结合了从局部雅可比矩阵和激活计算出的归一化sheaf不一致性，以及从相同前向状态导出的电路级因果涌现的高斯EI代理。

Result: 提供了解释分数、计算开销（具有快速和精确模式）以及玩具健全性检查分析的实用指南。LLM任务的实证验证被推迟。

Conclusion: EICS的构建是白盒的、单次通过的，并明确了单元，因此分数是无量纲的。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

*Andy Xu,Rohan Desai,Larry Wang,Gabriel Hope,Ethan Ritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLaID++ is an LLM fine-tuned for crystal generation, outperforming existing methods in stability, novelty, and space group conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of new materials is slow and expensive, hindering technological advancements.

Method: Fine-tuning Qwen-2.5 7B using a Wyckoff-based text representation and reinforcement learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: PLaID++ generates thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel structures at a ~50% greater rate than prior methods, with significant improvements using iterative DPO.

Conclusion: Adapting post-training techniques from NLP to materials design enables targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

*Yiyue Chen,Usman Akram,Chianing Wang,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，用于解决异构和不断变化的客户端数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式机器学习存在高资源成本和隐私问题；实际部署中，客户端数据分布随时间演变且客户端之间差异显著，导致标准联邦学习算法性能下降。

Method: 结合表征学习和进化聚类，分两个阶段进行：(1) 客户端学习局部模型以提取特征表征；(2) 服务器基于这些表征动态地将客户端分组到集群中，并协调集群范围内的任务特定模型训练。

Result: 在真实世界的数据集上实现了卓越的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Fed-REACT 是一种有效的联邦学习框架，可以提高异构和不断变化的客户端数据上的性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 我们讨论了迭代方法的具体方法，使其成为支持未来预测未经测试药物效果的初始框架，利用RWD临床数据和药物嵌入。

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

TL;DR: 量化会加剧对少数群体的影响，通过混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)与数据集抽样方法和加权损失函数相结合，可以减轻这些影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化对不同群体的影响不同，特别是对少数群体

Method: 分析量化过程中权重和激活的变化如何导致网络中的级联影响，从而导致logits方差降低、损失增加和群体准确性受损。研究扩展到验证这些影响对群体梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值的影响

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加和群体准确性受损

Conclusion: 通过混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)与数据集抽样方法和加权损失函数相结合，可以实现量化神经网络的公平部署

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps

optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive
performance characterization.

Motivation: 传统 PINNs 解决反问题计算成本高，每次新数据都需要重新训练。

Method: 该方法采用离线-在线分解，离线训练深度网络生成基函数，在线冻结网络，仅训练线性输出层。

Result: IP-Basis PINNs 在三个基准测试中表现出一致的性能，包括常数和函数参数估计，比标准 PINNs 显着加速，并且在稀疏和噪声数据下运行稳健。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs 是一种有效的反问题求解方法，具有快速、高效和鲁棒的特点。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Motivation: 现有的解决梯度冲突的方法计算成本高，限制了它们在大型模型和Transformer中的应用。

Method: 提出了Gradient Conductor (GCond)，它结合了PCGrad的原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制。

Result: GCond在ImageNet 1K数据集和头颈部CT扫描数据集上，使用MobileNetV3-Small和ConvNeXt架构进行了评估，结果表明GCond在保持优化质量的同时，计算速度提高了一倍，并在所有评估指标上表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，并且与现代优化器兼容。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够学习各种广义哈密顿动力学。

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

*Li-Chin Chen,Ji-Tian Sheu,Yuh-Jue Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用人口统计预训练模型（GDP），用于提升电子健康记录中年龄和性别等人口统计属性的表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对人口统计属性的表征学习关注不足，但这些属性在临床风险分层和治疗决策中至关重要。

Method: 该模型探索了不同的排序策略和编码方法，将表格形式的人口统计输入转换为潜在嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，顺序排序显著提高了模型在区分度、校准和信息增益方面的性能，尤其是在年龄和性别对风险分层有重要影响的疾病中。即使在人口统计属性预测价值较低的数据集中，GDP也能增强其表征重要性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，表格人口统计属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群推广，为提高医疗保健应用的预测性能提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

*Yuxuan Bai,Yuxuan Sun,Tan Chen,Wei Chen,Sheng Zhou,Zhisheng Niu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 FedTeddi 的联邦边缘学习 (FEEL) 调度算法，该算法能适应动态数据演变和通信资源限制，实现快速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，客户端可能会不断收集具有时变和非独立同分布 (non-i.i.d.) 特征的数据。关键挑战是如何及时有效地使模型适应这种不断发展的数据。

Method: 该方法量化了数据的时间动态和非独立同分布特征，使用类分布的 Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) 表示，并提出了一个新的优化目标以及联合调度和带宽分配算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基准方法相比，该算法实现了更高的测试精度和更快的收敛速度，在 CIFAR-10 上的收敛速度提高了 58.4%，在 CIFAR-100 上的收敛速度提高了 49.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的 FedTeddi 算法在动态数据演变和通信资源限制下，能够有效提高联邦边缘学习的收敛速度和精度。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

*Qihu Xie,Yuan Li,Yi Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SBS的参数高效神经网络表示方法，用于压缩卷积神经网络的权重，它通过抑制频谱偏差来提高重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络表示方法在重建高频细节方面存在不足，因为它们使用的标准多层感知器具有明显的频谱偏差。

Method: 该方法使用两种技术来抑制频谱偏差：单向排序平滑，以提高输出空间中的核平滑度；以及单向排序平滑感知随机傅里叶特征，以自适应地调节输入编码的频率带宽。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet等数据集上的ResNet模型的大量评估表明，与SOTA相比，SBS以更少的参数实现了显着更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: SBS是一种参数高效的神经网络表示增强方法，可以有效地抑制频谱偏差，提高重建精度。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Conclusion: 计算复杂度与其他实际方法相当，使其成为各种应用的有用选择。

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of
EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF), we call it as EMORF-II. As it is
equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the
computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods
making it a useful choice for diverse applications.

### [174] [The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07430)
*Long Li,Jiaran Hao,Jason Klein Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Xiaoyu Tan,Wei Chu,Zhe Wang,Shirui Pan,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，名为 Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL)，它使用 mass-covering f-divergences 作为排练机制，以解决在用可验证奖励的强化学习 (RLVR) 微调大型语言模型 (LLM) 时出现的 multi-attempt 性能下降和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 RLVR 方法在提高 single-attempt 准确率 (Pass@1) 的同时，经常导致 multi-attempt 性能 (Pass@k) 的下降，并伴随灾难性遗忘。论文认为，这是因为标准 RLVR 目标缺乏知识保留机制，并且反向 KL 散度会加速这种衰减。

Method: 论文提出的 DPH-RL 框架利用 mass-covering f-divergences (如 forward-KL 和 JS 散度) 作为排练机制，通过不断参考初始策略，强制模型保持广泛的解决方案覆盖。

Result: 在数学和 SQL 生成任务上的大量实验表明，DPH-RL 不仅解决了 Pass@k 的退化问题，还在域内和域外都提高了 Pass@1 和 Pass@k。此外，DPH-RL 具有更高的训练效率，因为它使用生成器函数计算 f-divergence，只需要从初始策略中采样，而不需要在线参考模型。

Conclusion: 论文强调了一个关键但被忽视的改进 RLVR 的方向，证明了正确选择散度度量是构建更通用和多样化推理模型的强大工具。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

*Antoine Ledent,Petr Kasalický,Rodrigo Alves,Hady W. Lauw*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的卷积自动编码器架构，用于用户建模和推荐任务，该架构在多个方面优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该模型能够灵活地学习不同交互类型之间的关联和组合，并且可以从显式评分和隐式反馈中联合学习。

Method: 使用卷积自动编码器架构。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，该模型在隐式和显式反馈预测任务上都取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅可以预测隐式和显式反馈，还可以提高预测的信息量，并且提供了泛化界限。

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的短期用水需求预测方法，该方法利用非监督对比学习对用户进行分类，并结合小波变换卷积网络和交叉注意力机制进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全球气候变化不确定性增加的背景下，保障水资源和供应已成为一个紧迫的全球问题。预测用水需求仍然具有挑战性，因为存在诸如气象条件等不确定性因素。

Method: 本文采用非监督对比学习对用户进行分类，提取不同消费行为的特征，并将其用于后续的需求预测任务中，使用小波变换卷积网络，结合历史数据和提取的表征。

Result: 在真实世界的DMA上进行了为期六个月的评估，结果表明，在不同DMA的MAPE方面，预测性能得到了改善，最大改善为4.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够识别受社会经济因素影响的消费者行为，从而增强对影响需求的确定性模式的先验知识。

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Result: RoseCDL将CDL重构为一种实用的事件发现和表征工具。

Conclusion: RoseCDL扩展了CDL在实际信号中的应用，超越了传统的压缩或降噪等任务。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失聚合方法，专门针对RLVR中动态生成长度的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提高大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力方面表现出强大的潜力，但训练过程中响应长度的大变化导致梯度方差高和优化不稳定。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析不同长度对策略损失的影响，将问题重新 формулировать 为寻找最小方差无偏估计量。提出 ΔL Normalization。

Result: 在不同模型大小、最大长度和任务上的大量实验表明，该方法始终能获得优越的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的 ΔL Normalization 不仅提供了真实策略损失的无偏估计，而且在理论上最大限度地减少了梯度方差。

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为将不确定性感知组件集成到现代神经架构中奠定了基础，为判别和生成建模开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种PINN框架的对偶公式，以提高周期性热传导复合材料均质化的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络（PINN）在解决与多尺度建模相关的偏微分方程（PDE）方面显示出前景，但当应用于具有不连续系数的材料（例如具有分段常数属性的介质）时，它们经常失败。

Method: 对强公式和变分（弱）公式，引入PINN框架的对偶公式。该对偶方法有助于推导有保证的上下误差界限，从而能够更可靠地检测PINN故障。将应用于平滑材料近似的标准PINN与使用光谱和基于神经网络的测试函数的变分PINN（VPINN）进行比较。

Result: 结果表明，虽然强形式PINN在受控环境中可能优于VPINN，但它们对材料不连续性敏感，并且可能在没有明确诊断的情况下失败。相比之下，VPINN直接适应分段常数材料参数，但需要仔细选择测试函数以避免不稳定性。对偶公式可作为收敛质量的可靠指标

Conclusion: 对偶公式的集成到PINN框架中，增强了它们在微观力学中均质化问题的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient models like K2-Think can compete with state-of-the-art systems through integrated post-training and strategic inference-time enhancements.

Abstract: K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like
GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system

Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source

*Ali Nawaz,Amir Ahmad,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了在不进行显式重平衡的情况下，二元分类器在不平衡数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不平衡分类问题中，尤其是在少数类实例稀少的医疗诊断和异常检测等关键领域，直接评估二元分类器的性能的研究较少。

Method: 系统地评估了各种二元分类器在真实和合成数据集上的鲁棒性，逐步减少少数类的大小，并使用一次性和少样本场景作为基线。通过合成决策边界生成来探索不同的数据复杂性，以模拟真实世界的条件。除了标准分类器外，还包括使用欠采样、过采样策略和单类分类 (OCC) 方法的实验，以检查它们在严重不平衡下的行为。

Result: 结果表明，随着数据复杂性的增加和少数类规模的减小，分类变得更加困难。在极端不平衡的情况下，传统分类器的性能会下降，而像 TabPFN 和基于 boosting 的集成等高级模型与传统分类器相比，保持了相对较高的性能和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为不平衡学习的模型选择提供了有价值的指导，深入了解了分类器在不依赖显式重平衡技术时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了图集成梯度（GB-IG），这是一种将集成梯度（IG）扩展到图上的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成梯度（IG）是一种常见的可解释性技术，但它假设数据是连续的，这使得它不适合于图这种离散结构。

Method: 本文提出了图集成梯度（GB-IG），它是IG在图上的扩展。

Result: 在四个合成数据集和三个真实世界图数据集上的实验表明，GB-IG能够准确地识别用于分类任务的图的关键结构成分，并且优于IG。

Conclusion: GB-IG在突出节点分类任务的重要特征方面优于IG。

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出的加速NE方法，在速度、结构保持和灵活性方面具有优势，且适用于交互式数据探索和更广泛的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

*Shusen Ma,Tianhao Zhang,Qijiu Xia,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于多元时间序列预测（MTSF）的 interpretable bidirectional-modeling network (IBN)，以解决缺失变量带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法缺乏可解释性，并且无法捕捉到更深层次的潜在时间模式。

Method: 该方法集成了 Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) 和 Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN)。UAI 估计重建值的不确定性，并应用不确定性加权策略来减轻高风险重建的影响。GGCN 显式地建模变量之间的空间相关性，而双向 RU 增强了时间依赖性建模。

Result: 大量实验表明，在各种缺失率情况下，IBN 实现了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: IBN 为具有缺失变量的 MTSF 提供了一个更可靠和可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用有损压缩算法压缩非激活专家以减少数据传输开销，从而解决LLM中MoE模型在有限GPU内存下的服务问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM学习领域，MoE推理模型被广泛应用，但在有限的GPU内存约束下高效地服务MoE模型成为一个重大挑战。将非激活专家卸载到主内存是一种有效的方法，但同时也带来了专家在GPU内存和主内存之间传输的挑战。需要探索一种有效的方法来压缩专家，并分析压缩误差如何影响推理性能。

Method: 采用有界误差有损压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）来压缩非激活专家，从而减少MoE推理过程中的数据传输开销。通过各种基准进行广泛的实验，并全面分析不同专家中压缩引起的误差如何影响整体推理准确性。

Result: 浅层专家（主要负责注意力机制和将输入tokens转换为向量表示）在受到有界误差的影响时，推理精度下降最小。中间层专家（是模型推理的核心）的误差会显著降低推理精度。在深层专家（主要负责指令跟随和输出集成）中引入有界误差有时可以提高推理精度。

Conclusion: 对不同层级的专家进行有损压缩对推理精度有不同的影响，浅层影响小，中间层影响大，深层可能有提升。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Conclusion: 逆问题可以有效地揭示指导llm构建的比例定律，从而以显著的成本效益实现理想的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.
