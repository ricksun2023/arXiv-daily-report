Realizing this potential, however, requires principled\nconsistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its\nutility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of\nprivacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and\nqualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct\nevaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload\nor generate using the toolkit's generation module.

However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due\nto position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents\nthan low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many\napproaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse\nPropensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to\nthe position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was\nclicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In\nthis paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to\nhighly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,\naccounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant\ndocuments when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of\nposition bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that\ntakes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We\nevaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets\nunder a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of\ntraining clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more\neffective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model,\nparticularly in top-n settings when n >= 30. For example, when n = 50, our\nIPSsim estimator achieves a statistically significant ~3% improvement (p <\n0.05) in terms of NDCG compared to the Doubly Robust estimator from the\nliterature."}

Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert\nbehaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected\nones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM\nagents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible\nbut suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address\nthis, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)\nframework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions\nbefore committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to\ndeliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we\nincorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action\ncritique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the\nbase model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation\ntrajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy.

This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE).

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a\ncritical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in\ndermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin\nlesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed\nimaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and\ncolor palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and\ntrained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using\ncustom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is\ndeveloped to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed\nDCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection\nmodels across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of\n85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive\ndataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and\n90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)\nalgorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making\nprocess regarding BWV detection.

This issue necessitates a unified\nframework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and\ncomparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an\nopen-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted\nadversarial examples.

While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,\nMP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical\nvariability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless\ntumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models\noffer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained\nclinical settings."}

We conduct an extensive analysis of the\nMCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples\nwith correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,\nsuggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of\nsamples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving\ncorrect predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our\nresults highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained\nLLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the\ngeneralization power of test-time depth adaptation."}

Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a\nchallenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution\ncomputer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and\nwhere no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher\naccuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.\nSecond, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual\ninput, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing\nexisting baselines.

Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).

In\ncontrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length\nrepresentations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or\nfamiliarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating\nvariable-length representations but typically require test-time search over\nmultiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov\nComplexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which\npredicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward\npass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a\nproxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely\nresembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to\nconditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.\nKARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a\nsingle pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of\nencoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.\nAdditionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive\nImage Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted\nimage complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.\nout-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition."}

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings\nhighlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional\ngeneralization in multimodal models without scaling the training data\ncombinatorially.
