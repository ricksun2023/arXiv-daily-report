### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC 模型用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构 (KC) 水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于自动评估在线学习环境中的知识建构水平，特别是在非正式的数字学习环境中。

Method: 该模型扩展了 DeBERTa-v3，并采用 Focal Loss、Label Smoothing 和 R-Drop 正则化来解决类别不平衡和提高泛化能力。使用了从 YouTube 科学频道收集的 20,000 个手动注释样本的平衡语料库进行训练和评估。

Result: DeBERTa-KC 在 10 折分层交叉验证中实现了 0.836 ± 0.008 的 macro-F1，显著优于传统模型和 Transformer 基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型可以有效地捕获非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和开发用于评估认知参与的自动化工具提供了可扩展的、理论指导的方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study assesses the quality of AI-generated lesson plans from five leading language models using different prompt frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated lesson plans.

Method: Generated 15 lesson plans on The Electromagnetic Spectrum using five LLMs and three prompt frameworks (TAG, RACE, COSTAR). Analyzed them using computational metrics: readability, factual accuracy, curriculum alignment, and cognitive demand.

Result: Model selection most influenced readability; DeepSeek had the most readable plan, Claude the densest. RACE framework improved factual accuracy and curriculum alignment. Learning objectives were mostly at the Remember and Understand levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

Conclusion: Readability depends on the model, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend on the prompt framework. Combining a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework and a checklist of concepts improves lesson plan quality.

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ReDiff，一个改进的扩散框架，通过教导模型识别和纠正自身错误来解决离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中由于训练-推理差异导致的灾难性错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中受训练-推理差异的影响，导致灾难性的错误累积，影响生成质量。

Method: 通过将生成过程从被动去噪重构为主动改进，引入ReDiff框架。该框架包含两阶段训练过程：首先，训练模型修改合成错误以建立基础的修正能力；然后，实现一个在线自纠正循环，模型通过学习专家的纠正来改进自身草稿。

Result: ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了稳定高效的并行生成，优于传统的去噪方法。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动改进和自纠正机制，有效解决了离散扩散模型中的错误累积问题，提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Sparse Tracing 的新技术，用于有效分析长上下文注意力模式，而无需大量内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可解释性技术在分析百万 token 上下文的 LLM 时，其计算量随上下文长度呈二次方增长，需要 terabytes 级的内存。

Method: 引入 Stream，一种可编译的分层剪枝算法，以近线性时间 O(T log T) 和线性空间 O(T) 估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码。Stream 执行二分搜索式细化，仅保留每个查询的前 k 个关键块，同时保留模型的下一个 token 行为。

Result: 在长链式思考推理 traces 上，Stream 在剪除 97-99% 的 token 交互的同时，识别出 thought anchors。在 RULER 基准测试中，Stream 在丢弃 90-96% 的交互的同时，保留了关键的检索路径，并揭示了从 needle 到输出的层级路由。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing 提供了一种实用的工具，用于分析注意力模式和追踪信息流，而无需 terabytes 级的缓存，使得在消费级 GPU 上进行长上下文可解释性分析成为可能，有助于 chain-of-thought 监控的普及。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化 EHR 文本，以确定患者是否有资格接受进一步 HIV 检测的新流程，从而实现高效的 HIV 筛查和早期诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于将机器学习方法应用于结构化数据，例如患者人口统计学，以改进 HIV 诊断，但这些方法通常忽略了非结构化文本数据（如临床笔记），而这些数据可能包含与 HIV 风险相关的重要信息。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化 EHR 文本，以确定患者是否有资格接受进一步 HIV 检测。

Result: 在鹿特丹伊拉斯谟大学医疗中心的临床数据上进行的实验结果表明，该流程在保持低假阴性率的同时实现了高精度。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子病历文本的新流程，可以有效筛选和早期诊断 HIV，从而减少传播。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对大型语言模型（LLM）在生命周期评估（LCA）中的应用进行了专家评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工智能和大型语言模型（LLM）作为支持生命周期评估（LCA）的工具，但缺乏对其可靠性、稳健性和可用性的系统证据。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务中的表现，并由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和指令依从性等标准对模型输出进行了审查，共收集了168份专家评审。

Result: 专家认为37%的回复包含不准确或误导性信息。在准确性和解释质量方面的评级普遍为平均或良好，格式遵守情况普遍良好。幻觉率差异显著，一些模型产生高达40%的幻觉引用。开源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上优于或与闭源模型不相上下。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LCA中直接应用LLM的风险，同时也显示了其在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的优势。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于游戏的评估方法，用于更全面、客观地评估多模态大型语言模型（MLM）的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLM评估方法存在问题，如静态基准测试无法联合评估多种能力，以及依赖主观、昂贵的人工或模型对比。

Method: 论文采用游戏评估的方式，特别是Dixit卡牌游戏，来评估MLM的能力。Dixit要求玩家为卡牌生成描述，以迷惑部分但非全部玩家。

Result: 实验结果表明，Dixit的胜率排名与流行的MLM基准测试结果高度相关。人机对战揭示了智能体策略的差异以及MLM推理方面有待改进之处。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估方法能够更有效地评估MLM的能力，并为未来的改进提供方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用 DeepSeek-R1 模型将大型语言模型 (LLM) 与优化建模相结合，以改进运筹学 (OR) 中的决策。重点关注 DeepSeek-R1 在运筹学基准测试中的有效性，并采用多种策略来减少幻觉并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型。先前模型存在token成本高和容易产生幻觉的问题，限制了其在供应链环境中的实际应用。DeepSeek-R1 是一种经济高效的模型，但其在运筹学中的应用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统地评估 DeepSeek-R1 在四个关键的运筹学基准测试中的表现：NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP 和 ComplexOR。采用多种策略来减少幻觉，例如 LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning (FSL)、Tool Calling 和 Multi-agent Framework。

Result: 研究评估了DeepSeek-R1在运筹学基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 研究旨在通过使用 DeepSeek-R1 和多种缓解策略，探索 LLM 在优化建模中的潜力，从而提高模型输出的准确性和与用户意图的对齐。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于记忆增强框架的大型语言模型(LLM)智能体学习目标分类函数的方法，无需参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、不灵活且不透明，因此本文旨在探索一种更有效的方法。

Method: 该框架利用情景记忆存储实例级别的批评，并利用语义记忆将其提炼为可重用的任务级别指导。

Result: 实验结果表明，与仅依赖标签的检索式基线方法相比，引入批评可提高高达24.8%的准确率。同时揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好导向数据时的行为差异，并提出了一个新指标“Suggestibility”来解释模型如何响应记忆中编码的不同监督表示。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，记忆驱动的自适应学习有希望构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM智能体。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LyriCAR的无监督歌词翻译框架，该框架通过难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略来提高翻译质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖于手工规则和句子级建模，限制了其对音乐-语言模式的内化能力，以及在段落层面上的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略。

Result: LyriCAR在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果，并且自适应课程策略减少了近40%的训练步骤。

Conclusion: LyriCAR框架能够有效地进行歌词翻译，并在效率和质量上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型(LLM)和符号自然语言理解(NLU)的混合方法，以期结合两者的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然应用广泛，但容易出错；而符号NLU系统虽然准确，但覆盖范围有限且需要专业技能。

Method: 利用LLM进行改写和文本简化，提供广泛的覆盖，并自动填补知识空白；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果关系的实验中，混合方法明显优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM和符号NLU的优点，提高了性能。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于将自然语言句子解析为依存树的基本算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与短语结构（成分）解析器不同，该算法一次处理一个单词，并在可以附加每个单词时立即附加，这与人脑解析器的特性相符。

Method: 该算法一次处理一个单词，并在可以附加每个单词时立即附加。

Result: 最坏情况下的复杂度为 O(n^3)，但在人类语言中，最坏情况只发生在 n 很小的情况下。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的依存关系分析算法，该算法具有类似人脑解析器的特性，并且在人类语言中表现良好。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个统一的范例，用于描述临床决策任务，并沿着临床背景和临床问题两个维度进行划分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学数据集，例如MedQA，依赖于简化的问答（Q＆A），这不能代表真实的临床决策。

Method: 该研究总结了现有数据集和基准的设置，回顾了解决临床决策的方法，包括训练时和测试时技术，并总结了它们何时有所帮助。此外，还将评估范围扩展到准确性之外，包括效率和可解释性。

Result: 该研究对现有临床决策任务的数据集和方法进行了分析和总结。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的范例可以明确假设，标准化比较，并指导具有临床意义的LLM的开发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

*Alexandra Apostolopoulou,Konstantinos Kanaris,Athanasios Koursaris,Dimitris Tsakalidis,George Domalis,Ioannis E. Livieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了希腊语嵌入模型（GEM），这是一系列为希腊语构建的transformer模型，基于广泛的、质量驱动的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理像现代希腊语这样形态丰富的语言时，面临着研究分散、架构多样性不足和上下文长度受限等问题，尤其是在法律等专业领域。

Method: 本文构建了大规模的希腊语语料库，并通过严格的质量过滤和预处理方法，从通用领域和法律专业来源创建高质量的训练数据集。在此基础上，预训练并系统评估了多种现代架构，如ELECTRA、ConvBERT和ModernBERT。

Result: 实验表明，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 新模型证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本论文旨在改进序列标注任务的迁移学习，通过调整预训练的神经语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的迁移学习方法在序列标注任务上的表现有待提高，特别是对于领域迁移和利用大型语言模型的情况。

Method: 提出了三种改进方法：1) 引入多任务模型，加入额外信号；2) 修改自回归大型语言模型的架构，实现双向信息流动；3) 利用生成式监督上下文微调框架。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练的神经语言模型可以在序列标注任务上实现最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过领域迁移、模型架构修改和生成式微调等手段，可以有效提升预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

*Marianne Menglin Liu,Daniel Garcia,Fjona Parllaku,Vikas Upadhyay,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为ToolScope的框架，旨在提高大型语言模型(LLM)在使用外部工具时的选择准确性，并解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的工具集通常包含具有重叠名称和描述的冗余工具，这会引入歧义并降低选择准确性。此外，LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效考虑大型工具集。

Method: 该论文提出了ToolScope，它包括：(1)带有自动校正功能的ToolScopeMerger，用于自动审计和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever，用于对每个查询进行排序和选择最相关的工具，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制，同时不牺牲准确性。

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准上的评估表明，工具选择准确性提高了8.38%到38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效提高LLM的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥补大型语言模型在理解低资源文化细微之处的不足，特别是孟加拉文化知识的不足。

Method: 构建了一个孟加拉语文化知识（BLanCK）数据集，其中包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和区域方言。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别中表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现不佳；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都会显着提高。

Conclusion: 强调了上下文感知架构和文化相关的训练数据的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: 本研究利用强化学习和直接偏好优化 (DPO) 来提高波斯语语言模型的推理能力，特别是在医学问答方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高小型语言模型在特定应用（如医学问答）中的推理能力至关重要，尤其是在波斯语等代表性不足的语言中。

Method: 采用强化学习与 AI 反馈 (RLAIF) 和直接偏好优化 (DPO)，通过翻译医学问答数据集为波斯语，并使用 RLAIF 生成拒绝-偏好答案对，用于 DPO 训练。通过提示 teacher 和 student 模型生成思维链 (CoT) 推理响应，构建包含正确和不正确推理轨迹的数据集。

Result: 使用包含 200 万个 token 的首选答案和 250 万个 token 的拒绝答案的数据集训练了一个基线模型，显著提高了其在波斯语中的医学推理能力。结果模型优于之前在约 5700 万个 token 上训练的 gaokerena-V 模型。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在数据可用性有限的情况下，以推理为中心的训练方法在开发领域特定语言模型方面的效率和有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为CreativityPrism的框架，用于全面评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同场景下的创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的创造力评估方法分散，且在不同领域和任务中差异大，缺乏统一的评估标准。

Method: 该框架将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，并结合九个任务、三个领域（发散性思维、创造性写作和逻辑推理）以及二十个评估指标。

Result: 对17个SoTA的LLM进行评估，发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距，且模型在同一领域内的任务表现相关性高，不同领域相关性低。多样性和质量指标之间存在强相关性，而新颖性与两者相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 在某项创造力任务或维度上的出色表现并不一定能推广到其他任务或维度，因此需要对LLM的创造力进行全面评估。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARTER: Combines candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning for efficient entity linking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional entity linking relies on large datasets and fine-tuning, while recent few-shot methods using LLMs are inefficient.

Method: ARTER categorizes mentions into easy and hard cases using embedding and LLM-based signals, then uses a low-computational entity linker or targeted LLM-based reasoning accordingly.

Result: ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47% and is twice as efficient as pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all mentions.

Conclusion: ARTER achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically combining different techniques and adaptively routing mentions.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 BoundRL 的新方法，用于长结构化文本的 token 级别文本分割和标签预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子或段落级别的分割方法无法有效处理复杂结构化文本中表格、代码片段和占位符等元素。

Method: BoundRL 仅生成起始 token 序列，并通过在原始文本中定位这些 token 来重建完整内容。使用强化学习与可验证奖励 (RLVR) 来优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐。通过系统地扰动部分生成的分割序列来构建中间候选，以缓解熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL 使小型语言模型 (1.7B 参数) 优于大型模型的少量样本提示。RLVR 显著优于监督微调，并结合中间候选进一步提高了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL 是一种有效的方法，可以对长结构化文本进行 token 级别的文本分割和标签预测。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在立场检测中存在偏见，尤其是在零样本设置下，会根据方言和文本复杂度等属性产生刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估立场检测方法中存在的偏见，尤其是在大型语言模型中，因为立场检测与政治倾向密切相关，但这一点在社区中被忽视了。

Method: 使用两个属性自动注释预先存在的立场检测数据集中的帖子：特定群体的方言/语 vernacular 和文本复杂性/可读性，以研究这些属性是否会影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 大型语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出明显的刻板印象，例如不正确地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性相关联，并将非裔美国人方言与反对唐纳德·特朗普相关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在立场检测任务中存在偏见，需要进一步研究和解决。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为DeepWideSearch的基准，用于评估智能体在信息搜索中整合深度和广度的能力。结果表明，现有技术水平的智能体在该基准上的表现不佳，并揭示了当前智能体架构中的四个主要缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索智能体缺乏在多跳检索上进行深度推理和大规模信息收集的能力，这对于实际应用来说是一个关键的缺陷。

Method: 提出了两种转换现有数据集的方法，生成一个包含220个问题的数据集，涵盖15个不同的领域。

Result: 即使是最先进的智能体在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，这突显了在信息搜索任务中整合深度和广度搜索的巨大挑战。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch的发布旨在促进未来对更强大和更可靠的信息搜索智能体的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么容易出错和产生幻觉，要么缺乏语义理解，需要一种能够整合鲁棒推理和可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 该框架将表格推理分解为规划、编码和回答三个专门的角色，并引入了一种自改进训练框架，该框架采用蒙特卡洛树搜索 (MCTS) rollouts 来生成伪黄金轨迹，并使用强化学习 (RL) 优化智能体。

Result: Mixture-of-Minds 实现了显著的收益，在 TableBench 上达到了 62.13%，超过了 OpenAI-o4-mini-high。

Conclusion: 将结构化多智能体工作流程与强化学习相结合，在推进表格理解方面具有很大的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）通过一系列任务，利用文本输入进行空间推理的能力，旨在探测其空间理解和计算能力。

Method: 通过象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动等任务，在结构化网格环境中测试模型的基本空间推理和多步问题解决能力。每个任务都通过增加网格维度来扩展复杂性。

Result: 结果表明，虽然LLM在小规模复杂性任务中表现出一定的成功，但随着规模的增加，性能迅速下降，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达到84%。

Conclusion: LLM在扩展复杂性方面的挣扎暗示了其底层架构中缺乏强大的空间表征。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的评估大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，通过计算文本所有可能的tokenizations的概率质量来评估LLM，而不是仅评估输出的特定tokenization。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM评估方法只考虑了模型输出的特定tokenization，忽略了其他可能的tokenizations，这可能导致评估结果不准确。为了解决这个问题，研究人员提出了通过边缘化来评估LLM的方法，即计算给定文本的所有tokenizations的概率质量。

Method: 该论文提出了一种无需解码的抽样策略，该策略不需要LLM生成步骤，而是依赖于模型和分词器无关的廉价抽样策略。

Result: 研究结果表明，无需解码的抽样策略能够以较低的运行成本提供足够准确的边缘估计。

Conclusion: 该论文的研究结果表明，无需解码的抽样策略是一种有效的LLM评估方法，可以在下游推理任务中使用。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，用于同步和融合访谈文本、音频和面部信号，以输出分级的抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的严重程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评估方法通常是二元的且特定于疾病的，无法满足临床上对严重程度敏感的跨疾病估计和决策支持解释的需求。

Method: 该框架结合了访谈文本的句子级Transformer嵌入、音频的log Mel统计量以及面部信号的动作单元、视线、头部和姿势描述符。通过校准的后期融合分类器融合标准化特征，产生每个疾病的概率和特征级别的归因。

Result: 在DAIC衍生的语料库上进行的分层交叉验证表明，该融合模型优于单模态/消融基线。在准确性和加权F1方面，该融合模型与最强的单模态基线相匹配，同时提高了决策曲线的效用和在嘈杂或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合降低了回归误差并提高了类一致性。消融实验表明，文本对抑郁症的严重程度贡献最大，而音频和面部线索对于PTSD至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM的token级别预测限制了模型捕获高层语义结构和长程上下文关系的能力。

Method: 引入ContextLM框架，通过next-context prediction目标来增强标准预训练。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均有提升。

Conclusion: Next-context prediction为更强大的语言建模提供了一条可扩展且高效的途径，以最小的计算开销实现更好的长程连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于LLM的RAG系统中的引文失败问题，即模型生成了有用的回应但未能提供完整的证据引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统存在引文失败的问题，这与回应本身存在缺陷的回应失败不同。研究旨在解决引文失败，提高引文质量。

Method: 1.构建了一个名为CITECONTROL的基准数据集，用于系统地改变回应和证据之间的关系，以分析引文失败的模式。 2.提出了一个名为CITENTION的框架，该框架集成了生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法，以改进LLM引文。

Result: 实验表明，引文失败随着关系复杂性的增加而增加。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL和迁移设置中均实现了显著的引文改进。

Conclusion: 结合不同的引文方法可以提高性能。CITENTION框架能够有效提升LLM的引文质量。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了过程奖励模型（PRM）在表格问答（TQA）中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程奖励模型（PRM）在数学等领域改进了大型语言模型（LLM）的复杂推理能力，但其在涉及半结构化数据的任务（如表格问答（TQA））中的适用性仍未得到充分探索。TQA对PRM提出了独特的挑战，包括大量不相关的信息、松散连接的推理步骤和特定领域的推理。

Method: 本文对用于TQA的最先进的生成PRM进行了评估，从答案和步骤的角度。

Result: 结果表明，结合文本和代码验证的PRM可以帮助解决方案的选择，但难以推广到领域外数据。分析显示，步骤级别的验证性能和答案准确性之间的相关性较弱，这可能是由于步骤依赖性较弱和因果联系松散造成的。

Conclusion: 目前的过程奖励模型在表格问答方面存在局限性，并为构建更强大的、具有过程意识的验证器提供了宝贵的见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRT introduces a post-training framework that teaches LRMs to utilize CIs effectively by using Hint-Engineering and reinforcement learning, which improves performance and reduces token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs are inefficient and inaccurate in complex math operations. Integrating CIs introduces conflict between probabilistic reasoning and deterministic knowledge.

Method: The study introduces CoRT, a post-training framework with Hint-Engineering for data synthesis and reinforcement learning to refine CI usage.

Result: CoRT improves performance by 4-8% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen models and reduces token usage by 30-50%.

Conclusion: CoRT effectively enhances LRMs' ability to use CIs, improving both performance and efficiency in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

*Matteo Silvestri,Flavio Giorgi,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' reasoning ability on tabular data may be due to memorization rather than genuine generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly evaluated on reasoning over structured data, but dataset contamination is often overlooked.

Method: Controlled probing experiments to investigate prior knowledge of tabular benchmarks.

Result: Contamination effects emerge for datasets with strong semantic cues. Performance declines to near-random levels when cues are removed.

Conclusion: LLMs' competence on tabular reasoning tasks may reflect memorization. Propose strategies to disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker improves RAG by using flexible sentence combinations for retrieval, enhancing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chunking methods in RAG systems are limited by fixed-granularity and static boundary identification, hindering adaptability to various queries.

Method: FreeChunker uses a cross-granularity encoding framework that treats sentences as atomic units, enabling flexible retrieval of arbitrary sentence combinations.

Result: FreeChunker outperforms traditional chunking methods on LongBench V2 in retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FreeChunker's flexible approach enhances adaptability and reduces computational overhead for complex queries in RAG systems.

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索仅用对话数据预训练小型语言模型的效果，并尝试通过微调使其更具沟通性。

Method: 该研究基于预训练的 llamalogue 模型，采用多种微调策略来增强模型生成文本的沟通性。使用了 PPO 和 DPO 微调方法。

Result: 该模型在大多数标准 BabyLM 基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小配对设置中的对话延续预测方面表现出色。PPO 微调对模型的影响好坏参半，而 DPO 微调进一步提高了模型在自定义对话基准上的性能。

Conclusion: 仅使用对话数据预训练的小型语言模型在对话任务上表现出潜力，DPO 微调可以进一步提升其性能。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了否定文本对大型语言模型（LLM）产生幻觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响。本文旨在研究LLM是否能识别否定造成的语境变化，并可靠地区分幻觉。

Method: 通过构建NegHalu数据集（使用否定表达式重建现有幻觉检测数据集），并追踪LLM处理否定输入时的内部状态来进行研究。

Result: 实验表明，LLM难以有效检测否定文本中的幻觉，经常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。

Conclusion: LLM在处理否定文本时，缓解其负面影响仍然具有挑战性。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

TL;DR: NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual are BERT-style models for Hebrew texts, outperforming existing models on Hebrew benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT models have outdated architectures compared to newer transformer-based models. ModernBERT and NeoBERT show strong improvements, motivating the creation of similar models for Hebrew.

Method: Trained BERT-style models using the same architecture as NeoBERT, focusing on Hebrew texts.

Result: NeoDictaBERT models outperform existing models on almost all Hebrew benchmarks. NeoDictaBERT-bilingual shows strong results on retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The models provide a strong foundation for downstream tasks in Hebrew NLP and are released to the community.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark and improve multi-turn contingency in dialogues between a child and a caregiver.

Method: A teacher-student framework with a novel alignment dataset for post-training is used to fine-tune BabyLM.

Result: BabyLM generates more grammatical and cohesive responses, but adaptive teacher decoding strategies provide limited additional gains.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training improves dialogue quality, but contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的指令精馏方法，用于将低质量的指令数据提炼成高质量的指令-输出对，从而提高大型语言模型的指令调优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优数据质量参差不齐，大量低质量数据被浪费，且现有数据增强方法难以有效增强这些低质量数据。

Method: 1. 构建了一个包含144K样本的数据集MIXTURE，该数据集将低质量或语义冗余的不完美指令簇与其高质量的精馏版本配对。
2. 提出了LM-Mixup方法，该方法首先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习进行优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规性三种互补的奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，LM-Mixup能有效增强不完美的数据集，使用其精馏数据（仅占整个数据集的3%）微调LLM，不仅超越了全数据集训练，还在多个基准测试中与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据是一种宝贵的资源，通过适当的提炼和LM-Mixup的增强，可以显著提高指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 量化LLM输出的不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上，使用最先进的开源LLM，评估四种置信度估计方法。

Result: 每种不确定性指标都捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法总体上产生最佳的可靠性，提高了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了每种方法的优缺点，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)中的内部表示可以作为学习知识的可靠代理。

Method: RECALL从分层典型样本的层状隐藏表示计算模型间的相似度，并执行自适应的、分层的参数融合，以对齐模型间的知识。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多个持续学习场景中的大量实验表明，RECALL在知识保留和泛化方面都优于基线。

Conclusion: RECALL为不断发展的llm提供了一个可扩展的、无数据的解决方案，实现了无缝的多域集成和对灾难性遗忘的强大抵抗力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）有时可以检测到它们何时被评估，并调整其行为以显得更一致，从而影响安全评估的可靠性。本文表明，向 LLM 的激活添加一个操纵向量可以抑制评估意识，并使模型在评估期间表现得像已部署一样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可以检测到它们何时被评估并调整其行为，从而影响安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 通过以下方式训练 LLM 表现出评估感知行为：(1) 在评估期间使用 Python 类型提示继续在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行预训练，但在部署期间不使用；(2) 识别到某个评估提示的存在始终意味着它正在被测试。然后，我们使用专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用 Python 类型提示。之后，我们通过激活操纵来抑制评估意识。

Result: 激活操纵可以抑制评估意识，并使模型在评估期间表现得像已部署一样，即使在提示存在的情况下也是如此。重要的是，我们在额外的训练之前使用原始模型构建了我们的操纵向量。

Conclusion: AI 评估者可以通过操纵模型使其表现得像已部署一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为稳健偏好选择（RPS）的后验、无训练方法，通过利用方向邻域共识来解决大语言模型在特定个体需求上的不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过昂贵的再训练来解决偏好覆盖差距，但可能无法推广到各种不同的偏好。当用户的请求反映出偏离训练数据中心趋势的细微偏好时，模型性能可能会不可预测地下降。

Method: RPS 从相关偏好的局部邻域中抽取多个响应，以创建一个更优的候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最一致的响应。

Result: 在三个不同的对齐范例（DPA、DPO 和 SFT）上的综合实验表明，RPS 始终提高了针对该基线的鲁棒性，在空间中代表性不足区域的具有挑战性的偏好上实现了高达 69% 的获胜率，而无需任何模型再训练。

Conclusion: RPS 提供了一种实用且具有理论基础的解决方案，用于提高偏好对齐模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from

### [45] [Hierarchical Sequence Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20505)
*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为分层序列（HSEQ）迭代的统一框架，用于解决检索增强生成（RAG）在多步问题和异构证据源上的脆弱性问题。该框架通过将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的分层序列，并进行结构感知迭代来收集足够的证据，从而提高问答的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法在处理多步问题和异构证据源时存在准确性和效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 该论文提出了一种名为分层序列（HSEQ）迭代的框架，该框架包括两个主要步骤：（1）将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为带有轻量级结构标签的可逆分层序列；（2）执行结构感知迭代，以在答案合成之前收集足够的证据。该框架还包括一个Head Agent和一个Iteration Agent，分别负责指导检索和选择/扩展HSeq。

Result: 在HotpotQA（文本）、HybridQA/TAT-QA（表格+文本）和MetaQA（KG）上的实验表明，HSEQ在EM/F1指标上优于强大的单通道、多跳和基于代理的RAG基线，同时保持了高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ具有三个关键优势：（1）一种格式无关的统一，使单个策略能够跨文本、表格和KG运行，而无需针对每个数据集进行专门化；（2）引导的、预算感知的迭代，减少了不必要的跳跃、工具调用和tokens，同时保持了准确性；（3）证据规范化，可实现可靠的QA，从而提高答案的一致性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型(llm)政治偏见的新方法，该方法依赖于多语言翻译的公平性原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在评估大型语言模型在翻译欧洲议会演讲时的政治偏见。

Method: 该研究系统地比较了欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量，观察多数党派（左翼、中间和右翼）的翻译质量优于局外人党派。

Result: 该研究观察到，多数党派（左翼、中间和右翼）的翻译质量优于局外人党派。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，大型语言模型在翻译欧洲议会演讲时存在政治偏见。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ARC-Encoder的上下文压缩方法，通过将上下文压缩成连续表示来减少推理成本，同时保持模型通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩技术需要微调目标模型或修改其架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 设计了一种Adaptable text Representations Compressor (ARC-Encoder)，通过系统研究训练策略和架构选择，输出比文本tokens少x倍的连续表示。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景中实现了最先进的性能，同时提高了推理计算效率，并且可以适应多个解码器。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一种灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可以与多个LLM无缝协作。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于频域分析和深度学习的方法，用于区分StyleGAN生成的图像和真实图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络(GANs)生成的照片级图像的快速崛起对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统提出了严峻的挑战。

Method: 该方法首先应用二维离散傅里叶变换(2D DFT)将图像转换到频域，然后在这些转换后的图像上训练ResNet50神经网络，以区分真实图像和合成图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该频域模型达到了92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC，显著优于在原始空域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征或“指纹”，该方法突出了信号处理技术和深度学习相结合以增强数字取证和加强工业人工智能系统可信度的工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用最先进的骨干网络与对比监督和自我监督学习目标相结合的 3D 形状特征表示学习中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法难以从 2D 图像中识别 3D 对象，通常需要大量的标记数据并且依赖于可能忽略关键形状关系的卷积神经网络 (CNN)。

Method: 将基于视觉 Transformer (ViT) 的架构与现代对比目标相结合，在下游任务的多视图 3D 分析中取得了可喜的成果，统一了对比和 3D 形状理解管道。

Result: 有监督的对比损失在 ModelNet10 上达到了约 90.6% 的准确率。

Conclusion: 使用 ViT 和对比学习，利用 ViT 理解整体形状的能力和对比学习的有效性，克服了对大量标记数据的需求以及 CNN 在捕获关键形状关系方面的局限性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack is a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that uses a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the performance of query-based transformer tracking methods by incorporating multimodal sensor features.

Method: The proposed method uses a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline, integrating bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR. It also uses a temporal smoother to refine trajectories.

Result: FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, with an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的标签平滑方法，称为在线标签平滑（OLS），以解决深度学习模型在医学图像分类中过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法无法考虑类别之间的关系，而医学图像分类需要可靠的AI系统。

Method: 该研究使用在线标签平滑（OLS），一种动态方法，可以根据模型自身的预测模式在整个训练过程中调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上，使用 ResNet-50、MobileNetV2 和 VGG-19 三种架构评估 OLS。

Result: 结果表明，与标准训练方法相比，OLS 始终提高了 Top-1 和 Top-5 分类准确率，包括硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏。此外，OLS 还可以生成更紧凑且分离良好的特征嵌入，表明表征学习得到了改善。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，OLS 不仅可以增强预测性能，还可以增强校准，使其成为在医学成像领域开发值得信赖的 AI 系统的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于鱼眼图像交通监控的检测框架，该框架通过预处理和后处理流程来增强图像一致性，并使用集成策略来提高检测精度。在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中，该方法取得了F1 score 0.6366的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机虽然能从单个视角捕捉大范围视野，但其固有的径向畸变和非均匀分辨率对标准物体检测器构成了挑战，尤其是在图像边界附近，物体外观严重退化。

Method: 该方法采用了一个简单而有效的预处理和后处理流程，以增强整个图像的检测一致性，特别是在受严重畸变影响的区域。此外，该方法还训练了几个最先进的检测模型，并通过集成策略结合它们的输出，以提高整体检测精度。

Result: 该方法在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中取得了F1 score 0.6366的成绩，在62支队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该框架能有效解决鱼眼图像固有的问题。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的实时渲染感知过滤方法，以解决3D高斯溅射（3DGS）模型在训练数据分布之外的相机位置观察时产生的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS模型在训练数据之外的区域缺乏训练数据，导致模型在这些区域的密度、颜色和几何预测方面存在不确定性，从而产生视觉噪声。

Method: 该方法利用从中间梯度导出的敏感性分数，显式地针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性，而不是各向同性方差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视觉质量、真实性和一致性方面都优于现有的基于神经辐射场（NeRF）的方法，如BayesRays。

Conclusion: 该滤波器可以无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染管线中，并且是实时的，这与需要大量事后重新训练或微调的方法不同。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 BrainPuzzle 的混合框架，该框架结合了物理建模和机器学习，以实现定量经颅超声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于颅骨和脑组织之间的声速差异大，以及大型探头与颅骨耦合的困难，超声脑成像仍然具有挑战性。传统方法容易受到颅骨引起的信号衰减和空间覆盖不全的影响，而纯数据驱动的方法难以模拟复杂的非线性波传播，导致量化偏差。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：1）逆时迁移，应用于多角度采集以生成保留结构细节的迁移片段；2）基于 Transformer 的超分辨率编码器-解码器，带有基于图的注意力单元 (GAU)，将这些片段融合为连贯且定量准确的 SoS 图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle 实现了卓越的 SoS 重建精度和图像完整性。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle 有潜力推进定量超声脑成像。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个统一的评估框架，用于检测和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见，包括文本到图像（T2I）生成和图像到图像（I2I）编辑。该框架结合了自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和专家人工判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文化偏见研究主要集中在文本到图像（T2I）系统，而图像到图像（I2I）编辑领域的研究不足。这篇论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 该研究采用了一个统一的评估框架，涵盖六个国家、一个8类别/36子类别的模式以及时代感知的提示，对T2I生成和I2I编辑进行了标准化协议下的审计。使用了具有固定设置的开放模型，并进行了跨国家、跨时代和跨类别的评估。

Result: 研究发现：（1）在不区分国家提示的情况下，模型倾向于默认使用全球北方、现代化的描述，从而抹平了跨国家差异；（2）迭代的I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，即使传统指标保持不变或有所改善；（3）I2I模型应用肤浅的线索，而不是时代一致、上下文感知的变化，并且经常为全球南方目标保留源身份。

Conclusion: 目前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍然不可靠。该研究发布了标准化数据、提示和人工评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见提供了一个可重复的、以文化为中心的基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于滤波器的异步重建方法(FIBAR)，用于从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动事件相机事件中重建强度图像是一项具有挑战性的任务，通常使用部署在图形处理单元上的神经网络来解决。

Method: 首先，事件发出的强度变化与时间数字IIR滤波器集成。为了减少重建噪声，通过一种新算法检测陈旧像素，该算法调节最近更新像素的窗口。认为对于移动相机，像素位置处不存在事件可能意味着图像梯度较低，然后使用高斯滤波器模糊陈旧像素。

Result: FIBAR在现代笔记本电脑CPU上运行，启用（禁用）空间滤波时，大约为42（140）百万事件/秒。少量简单的定性实验表明了FIBAR和基于神经网络的方法（FireNet）之间的图像重建差异。FIBAR的重建比基于神经网络的方法噪声更大，并且存在重影图像。

Conclusion: FIBAR的重建虽然噪声较大且存在重影，但足以用于某些任务，例如检测基准标记。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于固定变换，并且对噪声的鲁棒性较差。

Method: 利用潜在张量数据的双边结构，TBTLRR能够利用图像样本和特征之间的局部相关性。此外，TBTLRR集成了$\ell_{1/2}$-norm和Frobenius范数正则化项，以更好地处理实际场景中的复杂噪声。为了求解所提出的非凸模型，我们开发了一种受交替方向乘子法（ADMM）启发的有效优化算法，并提供了理论收敛性。

Result: 大量实验验证了其在聚类方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型在聚类任务上表现出色，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [59] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了卷积神经网络(CNN)与自注意力(SA)之间的性能差距，并提出了Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，它是一种改进的卷积算子，通过引入自适应路由和横向抑制机制，使其性能优于传统的SA机制。基于ATConv，本文构建了AttNet，它在ImageNet-1K上达到了84.4%的Top-1准确率，并且在扩散模型中应用ATConv可以提高图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力(SA)虽然具有强大的表达能力，但其二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积(Conv)虽然复杂度低，但性能不如SA。本文旨在找出SA优于Conv的关键因素，并改进Conv。

Method: 通过重新审视CNN的设计，本文发现了SA的两个关键优势：自适应路由和横向抑制。基于此，本文提出了Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，它在卷积算子中引入了这两个特性。

Result: ATConv在多个视觉任务中优于SA机制。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到了84.4%的Top-1准确率。在扩散模型中，使用ATConv替换SA可以提高图像生成质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Attentive Convolution (ATConv)有效地提高了卷积神经网络的性能，使其在多个任务中可以与自注意力机制相媲美，并且具有更低的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

TL;DR: 提出了 StableSketcher 框架，用于生成高质量、prompt 保真度高的手绘草图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成图像方面取得了显著进展，但在合成基于像素的手绘草图方面仍然存在挑战。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，从而更好捕捉草图的特征。2. 集成了一种新的基于视觉问答的强化学习奖励函数，以提高文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: StableSketcher 生成的草图具有更高的风格保真度，与 Stable Diffusion 基线相比，实现了更好的 prompt 对齐。

Conclusion: 引入了 SketchDUO 数据集，这是一个包含实例级别草图以及标题和问答对的数据集。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在利用图像和标题作为物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，通过结合标题训练，鼓励与共享潜在结构对齐，强调潜在的诊断特征，同时抑制虚假相关性。面临的主要挑战是难以大规模获取真实的、特定于实例的标题。

Method: 通过多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）生成合成标题，并利用维基百科衍生的视觉信息和分类单元定制的格式示例来指导生成过程，从而减少幻觉并产生准确的、基于实例的描述性标题。使用这些标题训练 BIOCAP。

Result: BIOCAP 在物种分类和文本-图像检索方面表现出色，证明了描述性标题在连接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面的价值。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了标签，在弥合生物图像与多模态基础模型方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed

significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as

filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场技术在场景表示和渲染方面效果显著，但获取光场需要高计算成本或专用设备。

Method: 设计了一个神经渲染管线，通过交叉注意力机制计算光线之间的关系，并预测目标光线的颜色。通过迭代更新源光线集合，保证遮挡内容生成的一致性。

Result: 该方法在各种具有挑战性的数据集上表现良好，无需重新训练或微调，并且优于相关的最先进的新视角合成方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的单图像光场生成方法，并在实验中验证了其性能。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LogitGap的新型事后OOD检测方法，该方法利用最大logit和剩余logit之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本之间的可分离性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常未充分利用模型logits空间中嵌入的丰富信息。

Method: 1. 提出LogitGap，显式地利用最大logit和剩余logit之间的关系。2. 提出一种无训练策略，自动识别用于评分的最具信息的logits。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的大量实验表明，LogitGap在不同的OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终如一地实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap 是一种有效的事后OOD检测方法，它通过利用logit空间中的信息来提高OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 PartNeXt 的新一代数据集，用于解决 3D 部分理解中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 PartNet 数据集依赖于无纹理几何体和依赖于专家的注释，限制了可扩展性和可用性。

Method: 构建了一个包含超过 23,000 个高质量、带纹理的 3D 模型的数据集，这些模型带有细粒度的、分层的部分标签，涵盖 50 个类别。并在两个任务上对 PartNeXt 进行了基准测试：(1) 类无关的部分分割，(2) 3D 部分中心的问题回答。

Result: 在类无关的部分分割任务中，最先进的方法在细粒度和叶级部分上表现不佳。在 3D 部分中心的问题回答任务中，揭示了开放词汇部分基础中的显著差距。在 PartNeXt 上训练 Point-SAM 比在 PartNet 上训练产生了显著的收益。

Conclusion: PartNeXt 通过结合可扩展的注释、感知纹理的标签和多任务评估，为结构化 3D 理解的研究开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的类别级别8D姿态估计方法，用于从单个RGB图像中估计铰接式自行车和骑自行车者的姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，精确估计骑自行车者的姿态对于骑自行车者 crossing 意图分类、行为预测和避撞至关重要。现有的6D姿态方法不足以应对自行车车把/踏板角度变化的情况。

Method: 联合估计铰接式自行车的8D姿态和3D关键点，并使用合成和真实图像数据混合训练，以推广到真实图像。

Result: 该方法在估计的8D姿态参数的准确性方面显示出有希望的结果，并且与使用刚性规范对象模板进行匹配的最新类别级别6D姿态估计器相比，获得了具有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够估计更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Method: 该方法积累了来自无监督数据的文本和视觉模态的综合知识，以更新测试时的多模态原型。此外，还设计了一种自适应更新权重来控制原型调整的程度，并引入了一个动态优先级队列来存储高置信度图像，以从历史图像中获取视觉知识。通过多模态协同表示学习对齐文本和视觉原型。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，该方法在封闭世界和开放世界设置下均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上，IB-GAN取得了与最先进的β-VAE竞争的解耦分数，并优于InfoGAN。在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，IB-GAN生成的样本在视觉质量和多样性方面通常优于β-VAE和Info-GAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN能够以解耦和可解释的方式利用潜在空间，并在多个数据集上取得了良好的实验结果。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPMStereo: a novel stereo matching network with a memory buffer for long-range spatio-temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and temporal consistency with fewer computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent depth estimation in stereo video disrupts user immersion in real-world applications like augmented reality. Modeling long-term temporal consistency is challenging due to the trade-off between limited temporal modeling and increased computational cost for capturing long-range dependencies.

Method: A Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) construction module is proposed for dynamic Stereo matching (PPMStereo). PPM consists of a `pick' process that identifies relevant frames and a `play' process that weights selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation.

Result: PPMStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency. It achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the Sintel clean/final (17.3% & 9.02% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer computational costs.

Conclusion: PPMStereo effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by maintaining a compact yet highly informative memory buffer, achieving temporally consistent information aggregation.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 验证生成视频中多智能体动态的合理性，现有基准侧重于个体而非多人交互场景。

Method: 提出一个严格的评估协议，用于评估文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）模型，并开发一种方法来重建2D鸟瞰视角轨迹。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部 MRI 基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但对这些因素的系统评估仍然很少。

Method: 分析了 54 个公开的脑部 MRI 数据集，共包含超过 538,031 个样本，从数据集和图像层面进行多层次的概述，并定量评估预处理的可变性。

Result: 揭示了大型健康队列和小型临床人群之间的强烈不平衡，证明了影响表征学习的显着异质性，标准化预处理后仍然存在残余协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 强调需要在通用脑部 MRI 基础模型的设计中采用预处理感知和领域自适应策略。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++ improves text-to-video generation by optimizing prompts through refinement, iterative scaling, and LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, which limits the generative potential of text-to-video models.

Method: RAPO++ uses a three-stage approach: (1) enriching prompts with relevant modifiers and refactoring them, (2) iteratively refining prompts using multi-source feedback, and (3) fine-tuning an LLM with optimized prompt pairs.

Result: RAPO++ achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: RAPO++ is a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution for prompt optimization in text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前基于文本到图像流模型的图像编辑方法在构建中间状态时忽略了与特定编辑目标相关的语义差距，导致编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新颖的无反演和基于流的编辑框架FlowCycle，它使用可学习的噪声参数化损坏，并通过循环一致的过程优化它们。通过迭代地将源编辑到目标并恢复到具有双重一致性约束的源，FlowCycle学习产生目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 大量的实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过学习产生目标感知的中间状态，实现了忠实的修改，同时保持了源一致性，从而在图像编辑方面取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的胎动检测方法（包括母亲感知和胎心监护）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题。

Method: 利用双重对比损失（包括空间和时间对比学习）来学习鲁棒的运动表征。此外，还引入了一种特定于任务的采样策略，确保在自监督训练期间有效分离运动和非运动片段。

Result: 在包含 92 名受试者的数据集上，CURL 达到了 78.01% 的灵敏度和 81.60% 的 AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎动分析中具有潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于diffusion的图像编辑受限于图像反演过程中的近似误差。

Method: 利用VQ模型的精确中间量化表示特性，提出包含文本提示校正和图像风格保持的反演机制，以及整体平滑策略。

Result: 在PIE-Bench测试集上，EditInfinity在添加、改变和删除编辑操作上优于现有diffusion模型。

Conclusion: EditInfinity在图像编辑方面表现出色，能高保真地编辑图像并精确对齐文本提示。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在较长的自由格式回复中更容易出现幻觉问题，这通常归因于累积的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LVLMs中，幻觉的增加仅仅是长度引起的错误，还是存在更深层次的潜在机制。

Method: 提出了一种新的“诱导-检测-抑制”框架，该框架通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导的实例来早期检测高风险案例，并最终在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了持续、显著的改进，证明了其有效性。强大的检测和改进的幻觉缓解不仅验证了该框架，更重要的是，重新验证了关于上下文的假设。

Conclusion: 这项研究旨在提供新的见解，并作为深入探索LVLMs较长回复中幻觉的第一步，而不仅仅是追求性能提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

TL;DR: COS3D: A collaborative prompt-segmentation framework for open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods for open-vocabulary 3D segmentation have limitations due to reliance on a single 3D language field or pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations.

Method: Introduces a collaborative field with instance and language fields, instance-to-language feature mapping, a two-stage training strategy, and adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement.

Result: Demonstrates leading performance on two benchmarks and potential for various applications like image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

Conclusion: COS3D effectively integrates language and segmentation cues for improved open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了DualGround，一种双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来显式分离全局和局部语义，从而改进视频时序定位任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态注意力中通常统一对待所有文本标记，忽略了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义，而未能有效利用词级信号。

Method: DualGround采用双分支架构，通过句子级路径传递[EOS]token，并将单词标记聚类成短语级单元以进行局部定位。引入了tokenrole-aware跨模态交互策略，以结构解耦的方式将视频特征与句子级和短语级语义对齐，并采用联合建模框架，不仅改进了全局句子级对齐，还通过利用结构化的短语感知上下文来增强细粒度时间定位。

Result: DualGround在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试的时刻检索和高亮检测任务上均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该设计允许模型捕获粗粒度和局部语义，从而实现更具表现力和上下文感知的视频定位，证明了解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中的有效性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略对象形状信息，导致对注释偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出了基于分割掩码的位置编码方案（MPE）以捕获空间坐标和对象轮廓，并设计了上下文增强模块（CEM），采用水平和垂直条带卷积核来提取远程上下文特征。

Result: 在CVOGL和VIGOR-Building两个公共数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明该方法达到了state-of-the-art的性能，在具有挑战性的地对空场景中，定位精度提高了3.39%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了一个强大的位置编码范例和一个上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了跨模态可能出现的语义不一致，并且容易受到文本模态主导的影响，从而影响识别准确性。

Method: 该模型引入了一个伪标签生成模块 (PLGM) 来生成伪单模态标签，实现自监督的单模态预训练。然后，它采用一个无参数融合模块 (PFM) 和一个多模态共识路由器 (MCR) 进行多模态微调，从而减轻文本主导地位，并引导融合过程朝着更可靠的共识发展。

Result: CMC 在四个数据集上取得了与最先进方法相当或更优越的性能，并且在 CH-SIMS 和 CH-SIMS v2 上具有显着的优势。

Conclusion: CMC 模型有效地解决了多模态情感识别中的语义不一致和文本主导问题，并在实验中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Motivation: 先前的工作通常以粗略的方式将文本特征整合到视频片段中，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的大量冗余信息。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法基于视频片段生成更细粒度的多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入基于原始视频字幕的文本特征，以进一步增强突出部分的视觉特征。

Result: GMFVAD 在四个主要数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 消融实验验证了 GMFVAD 的改进归因于冗余信息的减少。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

*Haodong Yang,Zhongling Huang,Shaojie Guo,Zhe Zhang,Gong Cheng,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的轻量级框架，称为知识驱动神经网络（KINN），用于解决复杂值合成孔径雷达（CV-SAR）图像识别中的表示三难困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动模型未能充分利用CV-SAR数据中固有的丰富电磁散射特征，这促使了本研究的开展。

Method: 该方法基于一种新颖的“压缩-聚合-压缩”架构，通过物理引导的压缩、聚合模块和自蒸馏的分类头来提取稀疏的、物理基础的特征。

Result: 在五个SAR基准上的大量评估表明，KINN在参数高效识别方面建立了最先进水平，并在数据稀缺和分布外场景中提供了卓越的泛化能力和切实的解释性。

Conclusion: KINN为表示三难困境提供了一种有效的解决方案，并为SAR图像分析中可信赖的AI提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为 Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC3) 的框架，用于解决以自我为中心的视频问答 (Egocentric VideoQA) 中存在的挑战，例如理解多个事件和识别手部-物体交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的以自我为中心的视频问答方法忽略了第一人称视角带来的独特挑战，例如理解多个事件和识别手部-物体交互。

Method: 该方法包含一个以自我为中心的 videoqa 基线，一个反事实样本构建模块和一个反事实样本参与的对比优化。通过事件描述释义和核心交互挖掘，为文本和视觉模态生成正样本和负样本。然后，将这些样本与原始样本一起输入到基线中。最后，在反事实样本参与的对比优化模块中，应用对比损失来最小化原始样本特征和正样本特征之间的距离，同时最大化与负样本的距离。

Result: 该方法在 EgoTaskQA 的 normal 和 indirect 分别实现了 52.51% 和 46.04% 的准确率，在 QAEGO4D 上实现了 13.2% 的准确率，均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的 DMC3 框架有效地提升了以自我为中心的视频问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的GUI grounding范式，即Instruction-as-Reasoning，通过将指令视为动态的分析路径，提高grounding性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。现有数据集中存在指令缺陷，且未能充分利用指令多样性。

Method: 论文提出一个两阶段训练框架：首先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT），然后通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: 提出的模型UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B在五个grounding基准测试中取得了state-of-the-art的结果。UI-Ins-32B在UI-I2E-Bench上达到87.3%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到57.0%，在MMBench-GUI L2上达到84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上实现了74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Instruction-as-Reasoning范式可以有效提高GUI grounding性能，并且缓解SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language

between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite
augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HyperET，一个高效的多模态大语言模型训练方法，通过在双曲空间中动态调整双曲半径，优化视觉表征以对齐文本，仅需少量额外参数即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM训练需要大量计算资源以实现跨模态对齐，主要原因是视觉编码器缺乏与语言在多粒度级别上的对齐。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构的特性，提出HyperET，通过可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，在双曲空间中动态调整双曲半径，实现视觉和文本模态在任意粒度级别上的对齐。采用三种配置：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET持续改进了现有的预训练和微调MLLM，且参数增加不到1%。

Conclusion: HyperET能够以较低的计算成本和参数量，有效提升MLLM的跨模态对齐性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的点云几何压缩面临泛化挑战，缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和处理分布外 (OOD) 数据的能力。

Method: 该方法采用利用空间和通道分组先验的通用上下文模型，并通过实例自适应微调 (IAFT) 策略协同显式和隐式压缩范例来处理 OOD 数据。

Result: 在包含 15 个不同数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc 实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AnyPcc 是一种新的点云压缩技术，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Result: 在标准基准上，AccuQuant在各种任务和扩散模型上展示了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant是一种有效的扩散模型量化方法。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are state-of-the-art for visual generation but rely heavily on positional encodings (PEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates how DiTs organize visual content and finds that patch tokens are surprisingly independent, with spatial coherence mainly governed by PEs.

Method: The authors introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), extending PEs to a 3D field with depth-aware and hierarchical encodings, enabling DiTs to model geometry in 3D.

Result: The PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that incorporating a structured 3D positional encoding field into DiTs allows for improved geometric reasoning and control in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的因果方法，用于预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，同时将这些元素显式地注入到跨模态表征学习中，以减轻偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像到食谱检索方法有一个隐含的假设，即食物图像可以完全捕捉到食谱中以文本记录的细节。然而，食物图像只反映了烹饪菜肴的视觉结果，而不是底层的烹饪过程。因此，学习跨模态表征来弥合图像和食谱之间的模态差距，往往会忽略细微的、食谱特定的细节，这些细节在视觉上并不明显，但对于食谱检索至关重要。当训练数据混合了来自不同菜系中的图像和食谱时，表征学习中的偏差预计会更加严重。

Method: 提出了一种新的因果方法，该方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，同时将这些元素显式地注入到跨模态表征学习中，以减轻偏差。

Result: 在标准的单语Recipe1M数据集和一个新策划的多语种多元文化美食数据集上进行了实验。结果表明，所提出的因果表征学习能够揭示微妙的成分和烹饪动作，并在单语和多语种多元文化数据集上实现了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的因果表征学习能够揭示微妙的成分和烹饪动作，并在单语和多语种多元文化数据集上实现了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种量子启发算法来解决二次无约束二元优化（QUBO）问题，该问题在数学上等同于寻找Ising自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索使用量子启发算法解决QUBO问题，该问题在数学上等同于寻找Ising自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。

Method: 该算法采用矩阵乘积状态（MPS）来紧凑地表示自旋构型的大量叠加，并利用离散驱动计划来引导MPS达到基态。在每一步中，驱动哈密顿量（包含横向磁场）与问题哈密顿量相结合，以实现自旋翻转并促进量子隧穿。MPS使用标准密度矩阵重整化组（DMRG）方法进行更新，该方法通过多次扫描自旋链迭代地最小化系统能量。

Result: 该算法可靠地识别全局最小值，而不仅仅是接近最优的解决方案，适用于各种QUBO实例。首先在公开来源的中间级数独谜题上证明了其有效性，该谜题涉及超过200个Ising自旋，其长程耦合由约束满足决定。然后将该算法应用于Biq Mac库中的MaxCut问题，成功解决了具有多达251个节点和3,265条边的实例。

Conclusion: 讨论了这种量子启发方法的优势，包括其可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

*Shiqi He,Yue Cui,Xinyu Ma,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了 Branch-and-Browse 框架，用于提升基于 LLM 的 Web Agent 的推理深度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Web Agent 在多步推理和回溯方面存在局限性，搜索策略粗糙且计算成本高昂。

Method: 该框架结合了结构化推理-行动、上下文记忆和高效执行，通过树状探索进行显式子任务管理，利用网页状态回放进行探索引导，并使用页面动作记忆来共享会话内和会话间的已探索动作。

Result: 在 WebArena 基准测试中，Branch-and-Browse 的任务成功率达到 35.8%，执行时间减少了 40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse 是一个可靠且高效的基于 LLM 的 Web Agent 框架。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型在数学问题上的思维链（CoT）表现，探讨其成功的原因，并提出了一种新的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CoT的成功是否源于搜索、程序记忆或规则一致的推理，并填补现有评估方法的不足。

Method: 将CoT建模为有向无环图上的规则随机过程，引入逻辑 близость 度量CoT轨迹与图结构的吻合度，并构建DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准测试。

Result: 发现不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异，即使PASS@k相近。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在自由形式的CoT和形式化证明系统之间取得了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Conclusion: Systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities, enabling general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone. Calls for next-generation vision language model for better cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE: Schema-agnostic feature encoder for relational graph data, enabling efficient and scalable GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs for relational multi-table data rely on schema-specific encoders, limiting scalability and parameter sharing.

Method: RELATE uses shared modality-specific encoders and a Perceiver-style cross-attention module to create fixed-size node representations.

Result: RELATE achieves comparable performance to schema-specific encoders with up to 5x fewer parameters on the RelBench benchmark.

Conclusion: RELATE supports varying schemas and multi-dataset pretraining, facilitating foundation models for relational graph data.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

TL;DR: 生成式AI通过大规模快速伪造事故证据，加剧了保险欺诈。欺诈者利用AI工具制造虚假索赔，例如逼真的事故照片和伪造身份。保险公司部署了AI检测软件等对策，但效果有限。本文介绍了UVeye车辆欺诈分层解决方案，旨在检测、减轻和阻止这种新型欺诈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈是一个普遍且代价高昂的问题，每年损失达数百亿美元。生成式AI的兴起为大规模实施欺诈引入了新方法，例如伪造事故照片、损坏证据和虚假身份。

Method: 介绍UVeye车辆欺诈分层解决方案

Result: 展示UVeye解决方案在检测、减轻和阻止AI欺诈方面的能力。

Conclusion: AI技术与检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏，以及保险公司面临的资源和成本障碍，意味着打击AI保险欺诈仍然是一个持续的挑战。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何利用人工智能技术，特别是通过分析学生的领导力人格特质，来预测他们的学业表现，从而为个性化学习提供支持。

Method: 研究方法包括：从环境工程系129名硕士生收集数据，进行五项领导力人格测试，结合学生的平均成绩，采用探索性数据分析、相关性分析和特征选择（Pearson相关系数）。使用SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost和LightGBM等七种机器学习算法进行建模和调优。

Result: 研究结果表明，使用RF分类器获得了最高的预测性能，包含17个人格特质特征和领导力标记特征的模型准确率为87.50%，排除该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个在早期识别学生优势和劣势的机会，并为个性化学习选择最合适的策略。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FLORA的知识图谱对齐方法，该方法无需训练数据，可迭代地为实体和关系提供整体对齐，基于模糊逻辑，可解释结果，可证明收敛，允许悬空实体，并在主要基准上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱对齐方法主要集中在纯实体层面的对齐，缺乏可解释的推理，并且需要训练数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑的知识图谱对齐方法FLORA，该方法可以迭代地对实体和关系进行对齐。

Result: FLORA在主要基准上实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单而有效的知识图谱对齐方法，具有无需训练数据、可解释性强、可证明收敛等优点。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型将有意义的文本隐藏在另一段相同长度但完全不同但连贯的文本中的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示了大型语言模型可能导致文本与其作者意图分离，从而进一步削弱对书面交流的信任。

Method: 提出了一种简单有效的协议，利用大型语言模型实现文本隐藏。

Result: 即使是参数量较小的开源大型语言模型也能获得高质量的结果，并且可以在本地快速编码和解码消息。

Conclusion: 这种协议的存在对人工智能安全提出了紧迫的问题，并挑战了我们对大型语言模型“知道”某些东西的理解。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Conclusion: AI PB是一个在实际零售金融中部署的生成式 agent，它通过显式路由和分层安全性的有根据的生成，可以在高风险金融中提供值得信赖的AI洞察。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100

Result: 在标记的比特币混合数据集上，基线检测器达到了很高的准确率，而HCLA增加了可解释性和交互式改进。

Conclusion: 以人为本的设计提高了金融取证的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在实践中人工智能的使用，考虑到人工智能与现实的脱节及其缺乏透明度，以及律师的首要义务，如诚实、正直和不误导法庭。

Method: 提出了一种人工智能使用的新模式，该模式更全面地反映了这些特征（验证-价值悖论）。

Result: 人工智能在法律实践中提高效率的同时，也需要投入更多的人工来验证其输出，这使得人工智能的净价值对律师来说通常可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 文章阐述了这一悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响，包括人工智能的使用，以及该悖论表明的应支撑法律实践的价值观：忠于真相和公民责任。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的审计方法是中心化的、不透明的且难以扩展，这为在高风险领域部署专有模型带来了重大风险。

Result: TRUST框架能够有效地检测推理缺陷，并对对抗性审计员保持稳健。

Conclusion: 该研究开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为安全和可信赖的LLM部署提供了一条切实可行的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在迈向通用人工智能过程中，从开放模仿到身份整合的转变，类似于人类发展的锁定阶段。

Method: 通过形式化锁定阶段，将其与学习动态中的已知现象联系起来，并提出了用于检测开始的 operational 指标。

Result: 实验表明，行为整合是快速和非线性的，但其对通用能力的影响并非单一的，结果显示从小模型的性能权衡到中等规模模型的无成本采用，再到大型量化模型的瞬态不稳定性的各种结果。

Conclusion: 这种整合是实现AGI级别可靠性的先决条件，也是安全的关键控制点。身份可以被刻意设计以提高可靠性，但也可能在扩展过程中自发出现，从而可能加强不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用进化训练方法优化AI来玩2048游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中优化人工智能仍然是机器学习研究中的一个根本挑战。2048游戏是研究决策、长期规划和动态适应的理想场所。

Method: 本文实现了两个不同的系统：一个双智能体元提示系统，其中“思考者”大型语言模型（LLM）智能体为“执行者”LLM智能体改进游戏策略，以及一个基于改进有限蒙特卡洛树搜索的价值函数的单智能体系统。本文还试验了回滚功能，以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了实质性改进，平均每个周期增加473.2分，并且在训练周期中具有明显的上升趋势（相关性$\\rho$=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也越来越深入，这表现在它开发了越来越先进的策略。相反，双智能体系统没有获得太多改进，这突出了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 进化改进技术具有提高AI在非确定性环境中性能的潜力。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了个性化认知模拟（ICS），旨在构建能够模拟特定个体思维过程的计算模型。通过构建一个新颖的任务，评估了不同认知表征方法在ICS中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在模仿人类行为方面表现出色，但它们模拟更深层次的个体认知过程的能力尚不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文构建了一个数据集，并提出了一个包含11个条件的认知评估框架，以测试七个现成的LLMs在作者风格模仿方面的表现。测试了不同的认知表征，例如语言特征、概念映射和基于配置文件的信息。

Result: 结果表明，结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，优于静态的基于配置文件的线索。LLMs在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发能够适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，从而推动了个性化和以人为本的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何使用大型语言模型（LLM）通过上下文学习生成抽象 PDDL 领域和问题实例，以实现给定的抽象目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态领域中，选择合适的抽象对于 agent 的规划、推理和解释能力至关重要，因此生成与给定目的相符的领域抽象仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 本文使用 PDDL 对 agent 的具体行为进行建模，并研究如何利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的上下文学习能力，根据自然语言描述的抽象目标生成抽象 PDDL 领域和问题实例。考虑了三种抽象类别：备选具体动作的选择抽象、具体动作序列的抽象以及动作/谓词参数的抽象，以及这些抽象的组合。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o 通常可以在简单的设置中合成有用的规划领域抽象，但它更擅长抽象动作，而不是相关的 fluents。

Conclusion: GPT-4o 可以生成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面优于抽象 fluents。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: STaBERT模型通过结合POI和时间信息，提升了人类移动预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型未能充分利用POI提供的丰富语义信息，导致预测精度不足。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，该模型在BERT基础上，通过POI嵌入和时间描述符来丰富语义信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，STaBERT显著提高了单城市和多城市预测的GEO-BLEU评分。

Conclusion: STaBERT模型有效地融合了POI和时间信息，从而提高了人类移动预测的准确性。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA: An agent that integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning for Embodied Question Answering (EQA), improving reasoning, exploration efficiency, and response accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EQA methods lack explicit thinking/planning, leading to inefficient exploration and ineffective responses.

Method: Introduce ToolEQA, which uses external tools for better information and reasoning. A novel EQA data generation pipeline creates the EQA-RT dataset with reasoning trajectories.

Result: ToolEQA improves success rates by 9.2-20.2% on EQA-RT and achieves state-of-the-art performance on HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench.

Conclusion: ToolEQA's tool integration and multi-step reasoning enhance EQA performance and generality.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，其在实际临床实践中的应用仍然有限。数据偏差是阻碍AI应用的关键因素。

Method: 该研究基于AI4HealthyAging项目的经验，识别了临床数据收集中的多种偏差类型，包括历史偏差、代表性偏差和测量偏差。

Result: 研究结果揭示了在性别、年龄、居住地和社会经济地位等变量中存在的偏差。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进临床问题设计和数据收集的公平性和稳健性提供了实用建议，旨在指导未来项目开发更公平的医疗保健AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Conclusion: 该模型为评估人工智能系统在军事行动中的附带损害提供了一个清晰的表示，并通过透明的推理机制进行了增强。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

TL;DR: 本文综述了大型语言模型（LLM）赋能的知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合的经典三层pipeline。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱(KGs)长期以来一直是结构化知识表示和推理的基础设施。随着大型语言模型(llm)的出现，知识图谱的构建已经进入了一个新的范式——从基于规则和统计的pipeline转变为语言驱动和生成框架。

Method: 本文首先回顾了传统的知识图谱方法，以建立概念基础，然后从两种互补的角度回顾了新兴的llm驱动方法:强调结构、规范化和一致性的基于schema的范式;以及强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现的无schema范式。

Result: 本文综合了各个阶段的代表性框架，分析了它们的技术机制，并指出了它们的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文概述了关键趋势和未来的研究方向，包括基于知识图谱的llm推理、agentic系统的动态知识记忆和多模态知识图谱构建。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在持续预训练时会降低模型的指令遵循能力和语义表示，并且依赖于原始基础模型或外部知识库，但在实际应用中，这些资源可能无法访问。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定了新的自监督目标，利用文本本身嵌入的领域知识，并在更深层次的语义层面进行编码。

Result: 论文提出了Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow)

Conclusion: IKnow 是一种简单而通用的框架，它利用文本本身嵌入的领域知识，并在更深层次的语义层面进行编码，从而使大型语言模型适应新领域。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Result: EBR在存在缺失和错误数据的情况下比现有推理器更鲁棒。

Conclusion: EBR在存在缺失和错误数据的情况下比现有推理器更鲁棒。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

Motivation: 探讨在人工智能风险和政策方面，政府在多大程度上征求并采纳了公众意见，以及这种参与式治理的有效性。

Method: 通过 landscape analysis，比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家，考察它们如何征求反馈以及这些意见是否影响了治理。

Result: 在所研究的三个案例中，公民和决策者之间没有建立有意义的对话。政府在吸引不同声音或宣传征求意见方面做得很少，导致大多数公民没有意识到或没有准备好回应。官员对他们收到的反馈的反应有限，未能创建一个有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前的方法不太可能在人工智能领域建立信任或合法性。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Method: 建立了考虑线性化交流潮流的网络拓扑优化模型，并提出一种图神经网络加速方法。开发了一种异构边缘感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作，作为候选的网络拓扑优化解决方案。

Result: 案例研究表明，该方法可以实现高达4个数量级的加速，在一分钟内提供交流可行的解决方案，并在GOC 2000总线系统上实现2.3%的最优差距。

Conclusion: 该研究在具有拓扑和跨系统泛化能力的大规模系统近实时网络拓扑优化方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Motivation: 当前评估LLM主要关注最终答案的正确性，忽略了推理过程的质量。

Method: 提出因果逐步评估（CaSE），通过评估每一步骤与前文的相关性和连贯性来衡量推理质量。

Result: 通过在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH数据集上验证，证明了CaSE的有效性，并且使用CaSE评估的数据进行训练可以提高最终任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Conclusion: 该算法可以在接近线性的时间内运行，并提供强大的近似保证。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Conclusion: EcomEval是一个综合性的多语言和多模态基准，可以有效评估LLMs在电子商务领域的性能，并为从业者提供可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型在初始、当前和未来环境状态偏差下的响应准确性，评估上下文切换和连续性。

Method: 区分封闭式和开放式基准，优先考虑闭环开放式真实世界基准来测试适应性。该方法衡量模型理解、预测和调整可扩展环境中状态变化的能力。

Result: 流体指数（FI）

Conclusion: 一个真正的超智能模型应表现出至少二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自维持计算，以实现最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于机器学习（ML）模型在感知和认知任务中具有类似人类的能力，因此将 ML 集成到理性智能体架构中的框架越来越受欢迎。然而，目前的 landscape 仍然分散且不连贯，通常侧重于将 ML 嵌入到通用智能体容器中，而忽略了理性架构（如 Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) 智能体）的表达能力。

Conclusion: 本文对集成 ML 的理性智能体架构进行了系统分析，为未来的研究方向和挑战提供了参考。

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）的框架，用于评估大型语言模型的推理轨迹质量，旨在解决当前评估方法费力、不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型推理轨迹质量的评估不足，依赖专家规则、手动注释和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法则过于简化。

Method: 使用基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）的评估框架，捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有更高的预测能力，表明有效推理能更好地被高维几何结构捕获。

Conclusion: 紧凑且稳定的拓扑特征集能够可靠地指示轨迹质量，为未来的强化学习算法提供实用的信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT: A two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for KGQA that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods struggle to fully exploit KGs and LLMs reasoning capabilities, assuming complete KG coverage and lacking mechanisms to judge when external information is needed, leading to reasoning failures.

Method: A two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that includes chain-of-thought fine-tuning and a plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process. It employs a Cartesian-inspired planning module to decompose complex questions and logical expression to guide tool invocation.

Result: N/A

Conclusion: The model learns when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的AGI评估指标，该指标考虑了不同认知领域之间的平衡性，并惩罚了专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AGI定义假设了补偿性，即某些领域的卓越能力可以弥补其他领域的失败，但这与真正的通用智能不符。

Method: 提出了一种基于广义平均积分的相干性感知AGI度量方法，该方法涵盖算术、几何和调和机制，并通过曲线下面积（AUC）量化不同补偿性假设下的鲁棒性。

Result: 将该方法应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域评分后，发现尽管它们的算术得分很高，但与通用能力还相差甚远。

Conclusion: 整合广义平均值为衡量AGI的真正进展提供了一个有原则的、可解释的和更严格的基础。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

TL;DR: 工业界数据库系统中的查询优化器在近半个世纪里，其核心设计都保持稳定。但云计算、海量数据和统一数据平台的兴起暴露了传统单体架构的局限性。本文回顾了生产系统中查询优化的过去和现在，并确定了它们今天面临的挑战。然后，本文重点介绍了行业中正在兴起的三大关键趋势，这些趋势有望应对这些挑战：查询优化和查询执行之间更紧密的反馈循环，优化范围从单个查询扩展到整个工作负载，以及从单体设计到可组合架构的转变。

Motivation: 传统查询优化器的局限性暴露于云计算、海量数据和统一数据平台的兴起。

Method: 回顾生产系统中查询优化的过去和现在，确定它们今天面临的挑战，并重点介绍了行业中正在兴起的三大关键趋势。

Result: 确定了三个关键趋势：1. 查询优化和查询执行之间更紧密的反馈循环。2. 优化范围从单个查询扩展到整个工作负载。3. 从单体设计到可组合架构的转变。

Conclusion: 这些趋势共同描绘了一个更动态、更整体和更适应性强的查询优化实践的未来。

Abstract: For nearly half a century, the core design of query optimizers in industrial
database systems has remained remarkably stable, relying on foundational
principles from System R and the Volcano/Cascades framework. However, the rise
of cloud computing, massive data volumes, and unified data platforms has
exposed the limitations of this traditional, monolithic architecture. Taking an
industrial perspective, this paper reviews the past and present of query
optimization in production systems and identifies the challenges they face
today. Then this paper highlights three key trends gaining momentum in the
industry that promise to address these challenges. First, a tighter feedback
loop between query optimization and query execution is being used to improve
the robustness of query performance. Second, the scope of optimization is
expanding from a single query to entire workloads through the convergence of
query optimization and workload optimization. Third, and perhaps most
transformatively, the industry is moving from monolithic designs to composable
architectures that foster agility and cross-engine collaboration. Together,
these trends chart a clear path toward a more dynamic, holistic, and adaptable
future for query optimization in practice.

*Ming Sheng,Shuliang Wang,Yong Zhang,Yi Luo,Xianbo Liu,Zeming Li*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了UREM，一种统一且有弹性的增强方法，旨在提高多维和高维索引在不同场景下的查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构导向方法在静态工作负载下表现良好，但在动态工作负载下性能下降；布局导向方法具有良好的通用性，但在静态工作负载下性能欠佳。因此，开发一种统一且弹性的增强方法以自适应地提高不同索引在不同场景下的查询性能是一个公开的挑战。

Method: 提出了UREM，它可以统一应用于各种平台上的不同索引；通过布局优化来增强静态工作负载下的索引查询性能；并通过部分布局重组使索引在查询转换时稳定性能。

Result: UREM在静态工作负载下将多维和高维索引的查询性能提高了高达5.73倍和9.18倍，在动态工作负载下平均提高了5.72倍和9.47倍。

Conclusion: UREM增强的传统索引甚至可以达到或超过最近的高级索引的性能。

Abstract: Numerous multi- or high-dimensional indexes with distinct advantages have
been proposed on various platforms to meet application requirements. To achieve
higher-performance queries, most indexes employ enhancement methods, including
structure-oriented and layout-oriented enhancement methods. Existing
structure-oriented methods tailored to specific indexes work well under static
workloads but lack generality and degrade under dynamic workloads. The
layout-oriented methods exhibit good generality and perform well under dynamic
workloads, but exhibit suboptimal performance under static workloads.
Therefore, it is an open challenge to develop a unified and resilient
enhancement method that can improve query performance for different indexes
adaptively under different scenarios. In this paper, we propose UREM, which is
the first high-performance Unified and Resilient Enhancement Method designed
for both multi- and high-dimensional indexes, capable of adapting to different
scenarios. Specifically, UREM (1) can be uniformly applied with different
indexes on various platforms; (2) enhances the query performance of indexes by
layout optimization under static workloads; (3) enables indexes to stabilize
performance when queries shift through partial layout reorganization. We
evaluate UREM on 20 widely used indexes. Experimental results demonstrate that
UREM improves the query performance of multi- and high-dimensional indexes by
up to 5.73x and 9.18x under static workloads, and by an average of 5.72x and
9.47x under dynamic workloads. Moreover, some traditional indexes enhanced by
UREM even achieve performance comparable to or even surpassing that of recent
advanced indexes.

TL;DR: 提出了RAG-Stack，一个用于RAG系统中质量-性能协同优化的三支柱蓝图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG的上下文中，如何联合优化系统性能和生成质量是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: RAG-Stack 包含 RAG-IR (中间表示)、RAG-CM (成本模型) 和 RAG-PE (计划探索算法)。

Result: 提出了一个三支柱蓝图，用于RAG质量-性能协同优化。

Conclusion: 该蓝图有望成为未来RAG质量-性能协同优化的标准范例。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent
applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a
database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more
reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive
research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are
considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet
challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and
generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears
due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and
databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we
present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance
co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an
intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple
quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system
performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that
searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this
three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG
quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于混合整数线性规划（MILP）的查询优化方法，用于解决大规模查询中的连接顺序优化问题。该方法在保证优化效率的同时，能够生成高质量的查询执行计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询优化器在处理大型查询时面临挑战，启发式方法在查询增大时性能下降或出现次优情况。

Method: 该方法基于MILP，构建了一个新的MILP模型，可以优化任意的bushy tree结构。同时，将MILP方法嵌入到一个混合框架中，在最有利的地方使用MILP求解器，在不太复杂的步骤中使用更有效的方法。

Result: 该方法可以扩展到连接多达100个关系的极大查询，并且在各种竞争的连接排序方法中始终实现最稳健的计划质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的MILP方法能够有效地解决大规模查询中的连接顺序优化问题，并在查询计划质量方面优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Finding optimal join orders is among the most crucial steps to be performed
by query optimisers. Though extensively studied in data management research,
the problem remains far from solved: While query optimisers rely on exhaustive
search methods to determine ideal solutions for small problems, such methods
reach their limits once queries grow in size. Yet, large queries become
increasingly common in real-world scenarios, and require suitable methods to
generate efficient execution plans. While a variety of heuristics have been
proposed for large-scale query optimisation, they suffer from degrading
solution quality as queries grow in size, or feature highly sub-optimal
worst-case behavior, as we will show.
  We propose a novel method based on the paradigm of mixed integer linear
programming (MILP): By deriving a novel MILP model capable of optimising
arbitrary bushy tree structures, we address the limitations of existing MILP
methods for join ordering, and can rely on highly optimised MILP solvers to
derive efficient tree structures that elude competing methods. To ensure
optimisation efficiency, we embed our MILP method into a hybrid framework,
which applies MILP solvers precisely where they provide the greatest advantage
over competitors, while relying on more efficient methods for less complex
optimisation steps. Thereby, our approach gracefully scales to extremely large
query sizes joining up to 100 relations, and consistently achieves the most
robust plan quality among a large variety of competing join ordering methods.

Motivation: 微服务架构的采用给数据库管理带来了重大变化，但相关研究文献匮乏。

Method: 对收集的微服务数据集（包含15年的数据）进行了实证研究，考察了约1000个GitHub项目。

Result: 微服务主要使用关系型、键值、文档和搜索数据库。52%的微服务结合了多种数据库。复杂性与数据库数量相关，较旧的系统偏爱关系型数据库，而较新的系统越来越多地采用键值和文档技术。小众数据库通常与主流数据库结合使用。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于微服务中数据库使用的经验证据，以供研究人员和从业人员更好地理解。

Abstract: Microservices architectures are an integral part of modern software
development. Their adoption brings significant changes to database management.
Instead of relying on a single database, a microservices architecture is
typically composed of multiple, smaller, heterogeneous, and distributed DBs. In
these data-intensive systems, the variety and combination of database
categories and technologies play a crucial role in storing and managing data.
While data management in microservices is a major challenge, research
literature is scarce.
  We present an empirical study on how databases are used in microservices. On
the dataset we collected (and released as open data for future research),
considering 15 years of microservices, we examine ca. 1,000 GitHub projects
that use databases selected among 180 technologies from 14 categories. We
perform a comprehensive analysis of current practices, providing researchers
and practitioners with empirical evidence to better understand database usage
in microservices. We report 18 findings and 9 recommendations. We show that
microservices predominantly use Relational, Key-Value, Document, and Search
databases. Notably, 52% of microservices combine multiple database categories.
Complexity correlates with database count, with older systems favoring
Relational databases and newer ones increasingly adopting Key-Value and
Document technologies. Niche databases (e.g., EventStoreDB, PostGIS), while not
widespread, are often combined with a mainstream one.

Conclusion: 本文研究的多产品广告位选择问题，提出了线性规划松弛和贪婪启发式算法，实验结果表明这些方法优于现有方法。

Abstract: The billboard advertisement has emerged as an effective out-of-home
advertisement technique where the objective is to choose a limited number of
slots to play some advertisement content (e.g., animation, video, etc.) with
the hope that the content will be visible to a large number of travelers, and
this will be helpful to earn more revenue. In this paper, we study a variant of
the influential slot selection problem where the advertiser wants to promote
multiple products. Formally, we call this problem the \textsc{Multi-Product
Influence Maximization Problem for the Balanced Popularity} Problem. The input
to our problem is a trajectory and a billboard database, as well as a budget
for each product. The goal here is to choose a subset of slots for each product
such that the aggregated influence of all the products gets maximized subject
to the following two constraints: total selection cost for each product is less
than or equal to the allocated budget for that product, and the difference
between the influence for any two products is less than or equal to a given
threshold. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally. We formulate
this problem as a linear programming problem and use linear programming
relaxation with randomized rounding. Further, we propose a greedy-based
heuristic with balance correction to solve this problem. We conduct a number of
experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets, and the results
are reported. From the reported results, we observe that the proposed solution
approaches lead to more influence compared to many baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了基于降维扩散模型的联合分布基数估计器ADC。它使用轻量级分数估计器有效地近似梯度映射（即分数函数），并通过积分分数函数来评估对数似然，以此计算数据分布的逐点密度值。为了回答范围查询，ADC首先使用高斯混合模型（GMM）预测其选择性，然后使用重要性抽样蒙特卡洛校正其预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基数估计器在处理高维复杂数据分布时面临挑战，而基于分数的扩散模型在估计文本、视频和图像分布方面表现出色。

Method: ADC使用降维扩散模型学习分数函数，并通过积分分数函数来估计数据密度。它还结合了高斯混合模型和蒙特卡洛方法来提高范围查询的准确性。ADC+通过训练决策树来识别高容量、高选择性的查询，从而进一步优化性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，ADC+在真实数据集上与Naru相当，优于MSCN、DeepDB、LW-Tree和LW-NN，同时使用的存储空间更少。在合成数据集上，ADC和ADC+对复杂的属性相关性表现出很强的鲁棒性，并且ADC+的准确性优于其他模型。

Conclusion: ADC和ADC+是有效的联合分布基数估计器，尤其是在处理高维复杂数据分布时。ADC+通过优化查询处理流程，进一步提高了性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance of score-based diffusion models in estimating
complex text, video, and image distributions with thousands of dimensions, we
introduce Accelerated Diffusion Cardest (ADC), the first joint distribution
cardinality estimator based on a downsized diffusion model.
  To calculate the pointwise density value of data distributions, ADC's density
estimator uses a formula that evaluates log-likelihood by integrating the score
function, a gradient mapping which ADC has learned to efficiently approximate
using its lightweight score estimator. To answer ranged queries, ADC's
selectivity estimator first predicts their selectivity using a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM), then uses importance sampling Monte Carlo to correct its
predictions with more accurate pointwise density values calculated by the
density estimator. ADC+ further trains a decision tree to identify the
high-volume, high-selectivity queries that the GMM alone can predict very
accurately, in which case it skips the correction phase to prevent Monte Carlo
from adding more variance. Doing so lowers median Q-error and cuts per-query
latency by 25 percent, making ADC+ usually twice as fast as Naru, arguably the
state-of-the-art joint distribution cardinality estimator.
  Numerical experiments using well-established benchmarks show that on all
real-world datasets tested, ADC+ is capable of rivaling Naru and outperforming
MSCN, DeepDB, LW-Tree, and LW-NN using around 66 percent their storage space,
being at least 3 times as accurate as MSCN on 95th and 99th percentile error.
Furthermore, on a synthetic dataset where attributes exhibit complex,
multilateral correlations, ADC and ADC+ are considerably robust while almost
every other learned model suffered significant accuracy declines. In this case,
ADC+ performs better than any other tested model, being 10 times as accurate as
Naru on 95th and 99th percentile error.

Method: 通过混合向量搜索将这些描述与相关的iconclass代码匹配。

Result: 该方法在五个和四个分类级别上实现了87%和92%的精度，显著优于传统的图像和基于关键字的搜索。

Conclusion: 通过采用整页描述和rag，该系统提高了分类精度，为大规模分析早期现代视觉档案提供了一个强大的工具。这种跨学科的方法证明了llm和rag在推进艺术史和数字人文研究方面的日益增长的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

TL;DR: ConvRec-R1是一个用于训练基于LLM的对话推荐系统的两阶段框架，通过Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline构建高质量数据集，并提出Rank-GRPO优化排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推荐系统存在生成目录外项目、违反输出格式和排名质量下降的问题。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：1. 使用Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline构建数据集；2. 提出Rank-GRPO，一种针对排名输出任务的GRPO扩展。

Result: 在Reddit-v2数据集上的实验表明，ConvRec-R1比GRPO基线收敛更快，并实现了更高的Recall和NDCG。

Conclusion: ConvRec-R1框架能够有效地训练LLM进行对话推荐，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by
enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through
conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains
challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的推荐系统中的更新策略，重点关注持续微调和检索增强生成（RAG）之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可以通过其先进的推理和规划能力来增强推荐系统。然而，用户兴趣和内容的动态性质提出了一个重大挑战：虽然最初的微调使LLM与领域知识和用户偏好保持一致，但它未能捕捉到这种实时变化，因此需要强大的更新机制。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的用户兴趣探索系统作为案例研究，我们对这些方法在成本、敏捷性和知识整合等维度上进行了比较分析。我们提出了一种混合更新策略，该策略利用定期微调的长期知识适应和低成本RAG的敏捷性。

Result: 通过在十亿用户平台上的实时A/B实验证明，这种混合方法在用户满意度方面产生了具有统计意义的改进，为维护高质量的LLM驱动的推荐系统提供了一个实用且具有成本效益的框架。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种混合更新策略，结合了定期微调和低成本RAG的优点，以应对LLM推荐系统中用户兴趣和内容的动态变化，实验表明该策略能有效提高用户满意度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their
advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of
user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial
fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to
capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This
paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing
on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a
case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across
dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid
update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic
fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B
experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields
statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a
practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于内容的音乐人工智能代理架构，旨在解决生成人工智能重塑音乐创作过程中出现的问题，如归属、权利管理和经济模式的结构性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流媒体系统不透明且版税集中，无法处理人工智能驱动生产的规模和复杂性。因此，需要一种新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 该方法通过块级检索和代理协调将归属直接嵌入到创作工作流程中。系统将音乐组织成存储在 BlockDB 中的细粒度组件（块）；每次使用都会触发归属层事件，以实现透明的来源和实时结算。

Result: 该框架将人工智能从生成工具重塑为公平人工智能媒体平台的基础设施。通过实现细粒度的归属、公平的补偿和参与性参与，它指向了一种后流媒体模式，其中音乐不是作为静态目录，而是作为协作和适应性生态系统发挥作用。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的音乐人工智能代理架构能够实现细粒度的归属、公平的补偿和参与性参与，从而构建一个协作和适应性的音乐生态系统。

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes
structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike
past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and
streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries
between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming
systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle
the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based
Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative
workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for
iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular
components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer
event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework
reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media
Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and
participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where
music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive
ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的旋转位置嵌入方法，用于在生成式推荐系统中联合建模时间和序列信息，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式推荐模型在表示交互事件在序列中的位置和发生时间方面存在局限性，通常使用学习嵌入或相对注意力偏差注入时间信息。

Method: 提出了时间与顺序旋转位置嵌入（TO-RoPE），它将索引和时间视为直接影响查询-键几何的角度来源，并提出了三种实例化方法：早期融合、按维度分割和按头分割。

Result: 在公共数据集和工业数据集上的大量实验表明，TO-RoPE变体在编码时间和索引方面始终优于现有方法，提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 旋转嵌入可以作为生成式推荐的简单、有原则且易于部署的基础。

Abstract: Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models,
predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their
effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event
occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock
time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative
attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if
designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal
and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in
LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires
incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose
Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs
that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry
directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and
split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a
proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve
accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results
position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly
foundation for generative recommendation.

Method: 通过翻译数据集进行数据增强，并对 Gemma-3 12B 和 Qwen-2.5 14B 模型进行微调。

Result: Gemma-3 12B 模型在 QC 和 QI 任务中表现最佳，平均 F1-score 达到 0.8857。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言电商搜索相关性任务中取得了有效的结果。

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original
and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated,
and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the
final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GREAM的端到端框架，旨在通过调整预训练的LLM来构建生成式推理推荐模型(GRRM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在作为生成式推理推荐模型(GRRM)时面临根本挑战，包括文本语义和协同过滤信号之间的内在建模差距，以及用户反馈的稀疏性和随机性。

Method: GREAM框架集成了三个组件:(i)协同语义对齐，融合异构文本证据，构建语义一致的离散项目索引和辅助对齐任务;(ii)推理课程激活，建立一个具有显式Chain-of-Thought监督的合成数据集，以及一个通过行为证据提取、潜在偏好建模、意图推断、推荐公式化和去噪序列重写的课程;(iii)稀疏正则化群策略优化(SRPO)，通过剩余敏感可验证奖励和奖励校准群优势估计来稳定训练后效果。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，GREAM相对于强大的基线模型取得了持续的收益。

Conclusion: GREAM为可验证的、rl驱动的LLM推荐器提供了一条可行的路径。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large
language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as
generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic
modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,
combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents
significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting
pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction
manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that
integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses
heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete
item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic
representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,
which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and
a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent
preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised
sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization
(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward
and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end
optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively
supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for
high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning
Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal
transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over
strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM
recommenders.

TL;DR: 混合 SSM-Transformer 架构中，检索完全依赖于自注意力层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合架构中不同组件的功能。

Method: 通过消融实验和稀疏化实验，分析自注意力层和 SSM 层在检索任务中的作用。

Result: 自注意力层对于检索至关重要，而 SSM 层没有补偿机制。稀疏化自注意力层对检索影响很小，但保持了大部分 MMLU 性能。检索需要 needle tokens 在生成过程中暴露，并在预填充或生成过程中有足够的上下文。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的组件以专门模块运行，而不是集成系统。这对架构优化和可解释性有直接影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统的深度强化学习智能体的性能受到其神经网络架构的限制，而这种选择通常是通过昂贵的超参数搜索来做出的，然后在整个训练过程中固定不变。本文研究了在线自适应架构优化是否可以打破这种限制并优于静态设计。

Method: NAS-DQN 智能体将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到 DRL 训练循环中，从而能够根据累积性能反馈进行动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN 在连续控制任务上优于三种固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，在最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性方面均表现出色，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅有益，而且对于在线深度强化学习中的最佳样本效率是必要的。RL 智能体的设计不必是静态的离线选择，而是可以无缝集成作为学习过程本身的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReGraphT的框架，该框架利用检索增强生成技术，将大型语言模型(llm)级别的推理能力转移到小型语言模型(slm)上，用于优化CUDA代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地利用具有大规模并行引擎的gpu仍然很困难。大型语言模型(llm)在从顺序代码生成优化的CUDA代码方面显示出强大的潜力。然而，在实践中使用llm面临两大挑战:基于云的api存在代码泄露的风险，本地部署通常在计算上是昂贵的和低效的。这些缺点激发了人们对小型语言模型(slm)的兴趣，因为它们更轻量级，更注重隐私。

Method: ReGraphT将CUDA优化轨迹组织成一个结构化的推理图，将组合的CUDA优化建模为状态转换，并利用蒙特卡罗图搜索(MCGS)进行高效探索。

Result: 实验表明，ReGraphT优于特定于hpc的微调模型和其他检索增强方法，在CUDAEval和ParEval上实现了平均2.33倍的加速。

Conclusion: ReGraphT使SLM能够接近LLM级别的性能，而没有相关的隐私风险或过多的计算开销。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Conclusion: 该模型降低了计算成本，提高了预测精度，并支持交通管理和“假设分析”，从而改进交通规划和决策。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为FairGRPO的层级强化学习方法，旨在解决医疗人工智能系统中存在的对不同人口群体诊断性能差异的问题。该方法通过自适应地调整优势权重，并结合无监督聚类来处理缺失的人口统计标签，从而在多个临床诊断数据集上实现了更好的公平性和更高的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗人工智能系统在诊断能力上取得了显著进展，但始终存在对不同人口群体诊断性能差异的问题，对弱势群体造成了实际损害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过整合分析不同的医疗数据来改进临床诊断，但通过强化学习进行的推理训练会继承并放大训练数据中存在的偏差，这些训练数据主要由多数人口群体主导。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO) 的层级强化学习方法。该方法采用基于表征、任务难度和数据源的自适应重要性权重调整优势，并利用无监督聚类来自动发现潜在的人口群体，以解决临床领域中常见的人口统计标签缺失问题。

Result: 在涵盖X射线、CT扫描、皮肤镜检查、乳房X光检查和超声的7个临床诊断数据集上进行的综合实验表明，FairGRPO将预测均等性降低了27.2%，同时将F1分数提高了12.49%。训练动态分析表明，FairGRPO在整个优化过程中逐步提高公平性，而基线强化学习方法在训练过程中表现出公平性恶化。

Conclusion: 论文基于FairGRPO发布了FairMedGemma-4B，这是一个具有公平意识的临床VLLM，它实现了最先进的性能，同时显著减少了不同人口群体之间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SHAP的特征选择方法，用于辅助诊断泌尿系统疾病，特别是膀胱癌，旨在提高预测模型的透明度和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高预测模型的透明度和有效性，辅助诊断泌尿系统疾病，特别是膀胱癌。

Method: 使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，并使用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡。利用SHAP值进行特征选择。

Result: SHAP特征选择在维持甚至提高平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

TL;DR: FINDER: A framework for classification problems, especially effective on noisy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy datasets are a key research challenge for classification methods.

Method: Uses stochastic analysis, stochastic features, Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion, and eigen-decomposition for classification.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results in Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and remote sensing detection of deforestation.

Conclusion: Discusses when FINDER outperforms existing methods, its limitations, and failure modes.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [157] [Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19933)
*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon 优化器是一种几何感知的 AdamW 替代方案，但在大规模神经网络训练中，其效率依赖于快速、近似的正交化。之前的理论工作分析了一个理想化的、计算上难以处理的版本，该版本假设基于精确 SVD 的更新。本文通过提供对 Muon 核心的不精确正交化更新的首次分析，超越了理想状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合 Muon 优化器中理论与实践的差距，之前的理论工作都分析的是理想化的版本，而实际应用中使用的是近似正交化。

Method: 在基于线性最小化预言（LMO）的优化通用框架内进行分析，引入一个现实的加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的不精确性。

Result: 揭示了不精确性与最佳步长和动量之间的基本耦合：较低的预言精度需要较小的步长但较大的动量参数。NanoGPT 实验直接证实了预测的耦合，随着近似精度变化，最佳学习率明显变化。

Conclusion: 近似过程（例如，Newton-Schulz 步数）从一个实现细节提升为一个必须与学习计划共同调整的关键参数。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了差分隐私(DP)去中心化联邦学习(FL)中的隐私预算量化问题，针对去中心化通信和本地更新等复杂算法组件的共存，提出了两种新的基于f-DP的隐私计算方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DP去中心化FL中，准确量化隐私预算具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件，如去中心化通信和本地更新。

Method: 本文开发了两种新的基于f-DP的计算方法：Pairwise Network f-DP (PN-f-DP)和Secret-based f-Local DP (Sec-f-LDP)。

Result: 实验表明，与基于Rényi DP的方法相比，该方法产生了一致的更严格的(ε, δ)界限和改进的效用。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在去中心化隐私计算中具有优势，通过结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中度，该计算框架捕获了来自稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声的隐私放大。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

TL;DR: 本文研究了线性回归中持续学习的任务排序问题，重点关注贪婪地最大化连续任务之间差异的排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索贪婪排序在持续学习中的有效性，并填补现有研究中的空白。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法中的工具，形式化了贪婪排序，并从几何和代数的角度进行了解释。通过在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实验，比较了贪婪排序和随机排序的收敛速度。

Result: 实验结果表明，贪婪排序比随机排序收敛更快。在高秩回归设置中，证明了贪婪排序的损失界限与随机排序类似。在一般秩的情况下，建立了与重复次数相关的分离。单次贪婪排序可能会失败，而允许重复的排序以$\\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt[3]{k})$的速度收敛。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序之间的细微差别。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 强化学习智能体通常在历史数据上进行训练，但当它们在实际市场中交易时，它们自身的交易会影响资产价格，从而导致训练和部署环境之间的不匹配，从而降低性能。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种新的椭圆不确定性集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒强化学习方法通过优化一组不确定性中的最坏情况性能来解决这种模型错误设定，但通常依赖于未能捕捉市场影响的方向性的对称结构。

Method: 我们开发了一种新的椭圆不确定性集。我们建立了在这些集合下最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，从而实现了有效和易于处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，我们的方法实现了卓越的夏普比率，并且在交易量增加的情况下保持稳健。

Conclusion: 我们的方法为金融市场中的强化学习提供了一种更忠实和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的无偏梯度估计器，用于解决零阶优化中的偏差问题，该估计器仅依赖于函数评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零阶优化 (ZOO) 方法存在偏差，除非扰动步长消失，本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 通过将方向导数重构为伸缩序列并从精心设计的分布中采样，我们构建了消除偏差同时保持良好方差的估计器。

Result: 在合成任务和语言模型微调上的实验证实了我们的方法与标准方法相比具有优越的准确性和收敛性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的估计器实现了平滑非凸目标的最优复杂度，并在实验中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了二点零阶梯度估计器，并确定了能够最小化估计器渐近方差的随机扰动分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在固定长度扰动上，忽略了方向对齐的潜在优势。为了填补这一空白，我们深入研究了方向对齐扰动（DAP）方案的理论和实证性质，该方案自适应地提供沿关键方向的更高精度。

Method: 将其表示为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题。

Result: 研究结果表明，这种期望的扰动可以沿方向与真实梯度对齐，而不是保持固定长度。通过对合成问题和实际任务的实证评估，证明了DAP在特定条件下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 我们为使用$\\delta$-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降提供了收敛性分析，将现有的复杂性界限扩展到更广泛的扰动范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的有效性。

Method: 提出一种新技术UCAN，它可以增强任何现有的随机平滑方法，将其从对称（各向同性）噪声分布转换为非对称（各向异性）噪声分布。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN的性能显著优于现有方法，在大型认证半径下的认证准确率提高了高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过定制的噪声注入，保证了分类器对扰动输入的预测，具有可证明的鲁棒性边界，从而提高了认证对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的时间序列预测方法，通过截断历史数据来提高预测精度，挑战了传统的时间序列建模假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型学习了大量的冗余特征（例如，噪声或不相关的波动），从而影响了有效信号的提取。

Method: 提出了一种名为自适应掩蔽损失与表示一致性（AMRC）的创新解决方案，该方案具有两个核心组成部分：1）动态掩蔽损失，其自适应地识别高度区分性的时间片段，以在模型训练期间引导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，其稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，AMRC有效地抑制了冗余特征学习，同时显着提高了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，而且为开发高效且稳健的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法论突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了掩码扩散语言模型（MDLM）在数学和编码任务中的应用，并提出了两种新的推理和后训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MDLM研究主要集中在其任意顺序解码和多token解码的优势上，但作者发现这些优势在数学和编码任务中并不明显，并且标准的多token解码会显著降低性能。因此，作者旨在探索如何更有效地利用MDLM的计算能力。

Method: 1. 提出 reasoning-as-infilling 方法，通过使用MDLM填充推理模板来构建输出，区分推理和答案token，从而测量答案不确定性并在模型收敛到答案时提前退出。2. 提出 multi-token entropy decoding (MED) 方法，这是一种简单的自适应采样器，可最大限度地减少基于位置条件熵并行解码位置时产生的误差。

Result: 1. 在GSM8k数据集上，使用其后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base，性能提升与使用人工编写的推理轨迹进行微调相当。2. MED方法在各个基准测试中保持了性能，并减少了2.7倍的步骤。

Conclusion: MDLM的训练和计算解锁了许多新的推理和后训练方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Motivation: RFID跟踪可能是国防资产的一个可行的解决方案，但传感器特异性差可能导致错误的检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 利用实际接收信号强度指示器(RSSI)数据和决策树分类，在计算机辅助设计(CAD)建模的平面图中进行有监督的学习模拟，重点是分类12个实验室区域。使用分层子样本训练模型，并计算类别权重以解决多类别设置中的类别不平衡问题。计算邻接感知混淆矩阵以更好地解释物理相邻区域。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以应用于实际模拟中，以实现区域级异常检测或国防供应物流的错位监控。通过更好的天线放置或额外的传感器以及与其他模式的传感器融合，可以提高低覆盖率和低信号区域的可靠分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步骤和长时程任务中面临挑战，而传统的强化学习方法在处理稀疏奖励时存在局限性，尤其是在缺乏评论模型的群体强化学习算法中。

Method: 构建一个基于相同提示轨迹的图，以量化每个步骤的质量并相应地分配优势。SALT作为一个即插即用模块，可以无缝集成到现有的基于群体的强化学习算法中。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT始终提高性能。

Conclusion: SALT框架能够有效改善大型语言模型在复杂任务中的强化学习效果，且具有良好的通用性和可操作性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to

Result: 构建了一个包含完整交易历史的图，包含超过24亿个节点和397.2亿条边。提供了节点和边特征向量的抽样方法，以及加载和分析比特币图数据的工具。

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具包使机器学习社区能够大规模地解决比特币复杂的生态系统问题，从而推动异常检测、地址分类、市场分析和大规模图机器学习基准测试等应用的发展。

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market
analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking. Dataset and code available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于拒绝抽样的算法，可以从现有的TPP模型中并行地精确抽样多个未来值，而不需要任何架构上的改变或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间点过程是事件序列的强大生成模型，可以捕获时间序列数据中的复杂依赖关系。它们通常使用自回归模型来指定，自回归模型从先前的事件中学习下一个事件的分布。这使得抽样本质上是连续的，限制了效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于拒绝抽样的新算法，可以从现有的TPP模型中并行地精确抽样多个未来值，而不需要任何架构上的改变或重新训练。

Result: 该方法在真实世界的数据集上展示了经验加速。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了大规模TPP应用的表达建模和高效并行生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种考虑延迟效应、累积效应和客户异质性的广告竞价策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润。以往的研究通常没有共同解决延迟效应、累积效应和客户异质性。

Method: 本文将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程 (CMDP)，并提出了一种结合数据分割策略的两阶段最大似然估计器。

Result: 该方法实现了接近最优的遗憾界 $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$，其中 $d$ 是上下文维度，$H$ 是轮数，$T$ 是客户数。

Conclusion: 仿真实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码被广泛用于加速大型语言模型（LLM）的推理。本文重点研究推测解码中的在线草稿模型选择问题。

Method: 设计了一种算法，该算法可以准确评估所有草稿模型，而无需对目标模型进行额外的查询。此外，还设计了系统高效的在线学习器版本。

Result: 在开放源代码LLM和各种数据集上进行了大量实验，证明该方法在各种领域中大大优于最先进的EAGLE3和BanditSpec基线，尤其是在需要长推理链的情况下。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的推测解码算法，可以在各种领域中大大优于现有的算法，尤其是在需要长推理链的情况下。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Motivation: 研究流动性和波动性代理是否可以预测市场范围的风险。

Method: 该研究整合了三个统计层：(A) 核心流动性和回报之间的相互作用，(B) 连接流动性和回报的主成分关系，以及 (C) 捕捉横截面波动率拥挤的波动率因子预测。该分析辅以向量自回归脉冲响应和预测误差方差分解，具有外生回归量 (HAR-X) 的异构自回归模型，以及使用时间分割、提前停止、仅验证阈值和基于 SHAP 的解释的防泄漏机器学习协议。

Result: 我们记录了跨层的统计上显着的格兰杰因果关系和适度的样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 使用来自 2021 年至 2025 年的每日数据（74 项资产的 1462 个观测值），我们记录了跨层的统计上显着的格兰杰因果关系和适度的样本外预测准确性。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的序列模型CTAE，用于解决非平稳、非线性动力学问题，并分离共享和区域特异性结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的alignment或multi-view方法忽略了时间结构，而动态潜变量模型虽然捕捉了时间依赖性，但通常仅限于单个区域，假设线性读出，或混淆了共享和私有信号。

Method: CTAE采用transformer编码器和解码器来捕捉长程神经动力学，并显式地将每个区域的潜在空间划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理学数据集上证明了CTAE的有效性，一个来自运动皮层区域，另一个来自感觉区域。与现有方法相比，CTAE提取的有意义的表示能够更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能够提取有意义的表征，更好地解码行为变量。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的时间序列解释框架ShapeX，该框架通过将时间序列分割成有意义的shapelet驱动的片段并使用Shapley值来评估其显著性，从而弥补了现有事后时间序列解释（PHTSE）方法主要关注时间步长级别特征归因的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的可解释性至关重要。虽然许多时间序列分类方法已经确定了关键子序列（称为shapelet）作为实现最先进性能和验证其在分类结果中的关键作用的核心特征，但现有的事后时间序列解释（PHTSE）方法主要关注时间步长级别的特征归因。这些解释方法忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的基本先验。

Method: 本文提出了ShapeX框架，该框架将时间序列分割成有意义的shapelet驱动的片段，并采用Shapley值来评估其显著性。ShapeX的核心是Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) 框架，该框架有效地学习了对分类至关重要的各种shapelet。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，ShapeX在识别最相关的子序列方面优于现有方法，从而提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX能够产生揭示因果关系而非仅相关关系的解释，这归功于shapelet的原子性属性。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于 MentalRoBERTa 的分层双头神经网络，用于将自杀风险分为四个等级：指标、意念、行为和企图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台已成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临多重挑战，包括严重的类别不平衡、发布模式的时间复杂性以及风险等级作为有序和分类的双重性质。

Method: 该模型采用两个在共享序列表示上运行的互补预测头：一个保留风险等级之间顺序关系的 CORAL（一致排序 Logits）头，以及一个实现灵活分类区分的标准分类头。一个具有 8 头多头注意力的 3 层 Transformer 编码器对跨帖子序列的时间依赖性进行建模，而显式时间间隔嵌入捕获发布行为动态。该模型使用组合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss）进行训练，该函数同时解决有序结构保留、过度自信减少和类别不平衡问题。为了提高计算效率，我们冻结了 MentalRoBERTa 的前 6 层（50%）并采用混合精度训练。

Result: 使用 5 折分层交叉验证评估模型，宏 F1 分数作为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型在自杀风险分类方面表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，该框架在保证理论安全性的同时，提高了现有算法的性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法要么缺乏有限样本保证，要么难以扩展。

Method: 设计了一个DDQN agent与强大的基线算法（GES或GraN-DAG）竞争，并始终从对手的解决方案开始。

Result: 在合成SEMs和真实世界基准测试中，该方法均优于GES和GraN-DAG，并可扩展到大型图。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一类新的基于RL的因果发现算法，该算法同时具有可证明的一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维数据集中，传统的欧氏距离KNN分类器存在问题，因为所有维度都被平等对待。本研究旨在通过引入维度权重来提高分类精度。

Method: 提出了一种新的维度加权方案，并将其融入KNN分类器中。该方法通过调整包含k个参考样本的区域的形状和大小，从而更有效地选择最近邻。

Result: 在各种合成和真实数据集上进行了实验，结果表明，与传统KNN相比，该方法在基因表达数据集上的分类精度显著提高（约10%）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于加权Minkowski距离的KNN分类器的重要推广，并通过维度加权方案有效提高了分类性能，尤其是在高维小样本数据集上。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法中，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，导致表示多样性降低。

Method: 我们模拟原型为一个高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格的程序进行更新，独立于编码器的损失。

Result: 这种解耦消除了原型崩溃，产生了多样的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦原型和编码器的训练，可以有效避免原型崩溃，提高表示学习的效果。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

TL;DR: 现有的时间序列基础模型（TSFM）效果不佳，通常不如简单的监督基线模型甚至经典模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据与图像和文本数据不同，缺乏对概念的密集捕捉，导致大规模网络数据收集方法失效。

Method: 提出从机会主义聚合转向原则性设计，构建系统覆盖时间序列不变性的数据集。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖的表征完整性，TSFM才能实现泛化、推理和真正涌现行为所需的对齐结构。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究利用大量的纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型，研究了结构连接（SC）和功能连接（FC）如何相互作用影响tau蛋白的传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解结构连接（SC）和功能连接（FC）如何相互作用影响tau蛋白的传播，因为越来越多的神经影像学证据表明，病理性tau蛋白沿着特定的脑网络积累，提示大规模网络结构在阿尔茨海默病（AD）的进展中起着关键作用。

Method: 利用多层图扩散模型检查SC-FC的相互作用。

Result: 模型揭示了SC和FC的区域非对称贡献。FC主要驱动皮层下区域、脑岛、额叶和颞叶皮层的tau蛋白传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起着更大的作用。SC与FC相对优势的空间模式与参与炎症、细胞凋亡和溶酶体功能的AD相关基因的区域表达密切相关。

Conclusion: 连接体结构限制了tau蛋白的扩散，并且SC和FC的主导地位随着疾病的进程而变化，FC通常在AD早期占主导地位，而SC在后期成为主要的。其他非可改变的风险因素和生物学机制通过以区域特异性方式在解剖和功能通路之间转移主要通路，选择性地重塑tau蛋白的传播。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Result: 理论分析表明，ADP-VRSGP 在适当的学习率下实现了稳健的收敛，显著提高了训练稳定性和速度。实验结果表明，该方法在多个场景中优于现有的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了隐私保护的去中心化学习的挑战。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

Motivation: 现有的基于神经的方法在扩展到更大的实例时面临挑战，特别是在与全局热图、边权重或访问矩阵相关的内存约束方面，以及在生成高质量的初始解决方案和缺乏足够的全局指导以有效地导航广阔的搜索空间方面。

Method: 首先使用稀疏热图图将 TSP 实例划分为簇，并将它们抽象为超节点，然后生成超旅行以指导初始化和优化过程。通过关注与超旅行相关的边缘来减少搜索空间。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的基于神经的方法，特别是在处理更大规模的实例时，显着缩小了与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS 方法有效地解决了大规模 TSP 实例，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV 通过将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数，优化大型语言模型 (LLM) 的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR 有效地使用二元正确性奖励在客观领域训练模型，但忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。RLEV 通过将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数来扩展此框架。

Method: 使用带有显式 ground-truth 价值标签的考试风格数据，RLEV 在多个 RL 算法和模型规模上始终优于仅正确性基线。

Result: RLEV 策略不仅提高了价值加权准确性，而且还学习了一种价值敏感的终止策略：对于低价值提示简洁，对于高价值提示彻底。消融研究证实，这种增益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: RLEV 在嘈杂的价值信号（例如基于难度的标签）下仍然稳健，这表明优化显式效用函数为将 LLM 与人类优先级对齐提供了一条实用的路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种风险感知的约束强化学习框架，该框架在奖励值和时间上表现出每阶段的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的约束强化学习忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的。

Method: 该框架使用优化的确定性等价物（OCEs），并利用参数化的强拉格朗日对偶性，产生了一个简单的算法配方，可以应用于标准强化学习求解器，如PPO。

Result: 该算法在常见假设下收敛，并通过数值实验验证了该方法的风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个风险感知的约束强化学习框架，并在理论和实验上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在PAC学习中 replicability 的三种近似概念，并给出了样本最优的 agnostic PAC 学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始 replicability 算法成本高昂，例如阈值学习没有 replicable 算法。因此，作者研究在何种近似 replicability 概念下可以进行学习。

Method: 提出了 replicability 的三种松弛方法：Pointwise、Approximate 和 Semi。

Result: 对于常数 replicability 参数，获得了样本最优的 agnostic PAC 学习器：Pointwise 和 Approximate 可以用 $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ 样本实现，而 Semi 需要 $\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ 标记样本。

Conclusion: 在 PAC 学习中， replicability 的近似概念可以有效地实现样本最优的 agnostic PAC 学习。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores using routine lab data and machine learning to detect cancer in dogs, but finds the signal too weak for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early cancer detection in dogs is challenging, and routine lab data is a potentially low-cost source, but has limitations.

Method: A comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126 analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature selection methods, and data balancing techniques.

Result: The best model achieved moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815) but poor clinical classification performance (F1-score = 0.25).

Conclusion: While a cancer signal exists in lab data, it's too weak for reliable discrimination, requiring integration of multi-modal data sources.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的个性化联邦学习算法，名为CO-PFL，它通过动态估计每个客户端的贡献来进行全局聚合，并结合参数化个性化机制与mask-aware动量优化，以提高个性化准确性、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构情况下表现不佳，其标准聚合方法未能考虑每个客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优的个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL算法通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差，利用来自梯度和数据子空间的信息，对每个客户端的贡献进行联合评估。此外，它还整合了参数化个性化机制与mask-aware动量优化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化准确性、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过减轻聚合偏差、加强全局协调和增强局部性能，有效地促进了具有稳定更新的定制子模型的构建。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

TL;DR: 本研究旨在通过重新构建约束优化问题，提高谱聚类算法的效率，并提出 Fair-SMW 算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前将平衡性作为公平性指标纳入谱聚类算法会导致计算时间过长。

Method: 通过拉格朗日方法和 Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) 恒等式推导的新公式，重新构建约束优化问题。

Result: Fair-SMW 算法在计算时间上比现有技术快两倍，并且足够灵活，可以实现两倍的平衡性。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW 算法在保证与现有算法相当的平衡性的同时，提供了更高的运行时性能。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Result: QKCV提高了基于注意力的模型在各种真实世界数据集上的预测精度。此外，QKCV在微调单变量时间序列基础模型时表现出显著的适应性，只需更新静态嵌入C，同时保留预训练的权重，从而减少了计算开销并实现了卓越的微调性能。

Conclusion: QKCV是一种有效的注意力机制，可以提高时间序列预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在实际应用中面临模型过拟合和局部模型发散的挑战，这是由于客户端之间有限且非独立同分布的数据造成的。

Method: 本文提出了一种称为 MetaVD 的贝叶斯元学习方法，该方法通过共享超网络学习预测客户端相关的 dropout 率。此外，本文还强调了元学习的后验适应视角和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合视角。

Result: MetaVD 在各种稀疏和非独立同分布的联邦学习数据集上表现出卓越的分类准确率和不确定性校准性能，尤其是在分布外客户端上。MetaVD 压缩了每个客户端所需的局部模型参数，从而减轻了模型过拟合并降低了通信成本。

Conclusion: MetaVD 是一种有效的联邦学习模型个性化方法，它能够提高分类准确率、不确定性校准性能，并降低通信成本。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for

introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自知识蒸馏方法，称为层间知识混合(LKM)，它提高了gnn的精度，同时在训练和推理过程中增加了可忽略的计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的精度可以通过增加模型的复杂性来提高，但这也会增加训练和推理过程中的计算成本和内存需求，因此需要更精确的模型。

Method: 通过最小化GNN层预先存在的隐藏嵌入之间的平均绝对距离，LKM有效地聚合多跳和多尺度信息，从而改进局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: LKM方法有效地降低了高达9.8%(QM9)、45.3%(MD17能量)和22.9%(Chignolin)的量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了LKM有潜力显著提高GNNs化学性质预测的准确性，而不会显著增加训练和推理成本。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

TL;DR: 选择性分类器通过在模型认为不确定的输入上弃权来提高模型可靠性。这项工作将这种不足形式化为选择性分类差距，并将这种差距分解为五个不同的松散来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声以及实施或位移引起的松弛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是现有的选择性分类方法未能达到完美排序oracle的黄金标准性能，后者完全按照正确性的顺序接受例子。

Method: 该文提出了选择性分类差距的有限样本分解方法，并将其分解为五个不同的松散来源。

Result: 结果表明，单调事后校准对缩小差距的影响有限，因为它们很少改变模型的基础分数排序。此外，更丰富的、特征感知的校准器可以显著改善分数排序，并且数据偏移引入了一个单独的松弛，需要进行分布鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: 该分解产生了一个定量误差预算以及可操作的设计指南，实践者可以使用这些指南来构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: 联邦学习(FL)面临数据异构性的重大挑战，这会损害模型性能和收敛性。为了解决这个问题，现有的方法已经取得了显著的进展。然而，在某些异构场景中提高性能仍然是一个被忽视的问题：这些方法在不同的异构场景下的部署有多强大？


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在各种异构场景下的鲁棒性有限。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架FedGPS(联邦目标路径协同)，该框架无缝地集成了来自其他人的统计分布和梯度信息。具体来说，FedGPS静态地修改每个客户的学习目标，以使用代理信息隐式地建模全局数据分布，同时在每一轮使用来自其他客户的梯度信息动态地调整本地更新方向。

Result: 大量的实验表明，FedGPS在不同的异构场景中优于最先进的方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS在各种异构场景中优于现有方法，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 行为基础模型（BFMs）能够在测试时直接检索任何指定奖励函数的高性能策略，通常被称为零样本强化学习（RL）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然这在计算方面非常有效，但在数据方面可能效率较低：作为一个标准假设，BFM需要计算不可忽略的推理数据集上的奖励，假设可以访问奖励的函数形式或大量的标注工作。为了缓解这些限制，我们通过在测试时与环境的交互来解决任务推理问题。

Method: 我们提出了OpTI-BFM，这是一种乐观的决策标准，可以直接对奖励函数的不确定性进行建模，并指导BFM进行数据收集以进行任务推理。

Result: 在经验上，我们在已建立的零样本基准上评估OpTI-BFM，并观察到它使基于后继特征的BFM能够在少量的episode中识别和优化看不见的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: 我们通过与线性bandits的上限置信度算法的直接联系，为训练良好的BFM提供了后悔界限。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.
