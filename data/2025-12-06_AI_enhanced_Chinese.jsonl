Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics. Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses. The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics. Overall, the study demonstrates that personalization produces metric-dependent shifts rather than uniform improvements and provides a methodological foundation for more transparent and robust personalization in agentic AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIVisor\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u54a8\u8be2\u7684 agentic \u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a LLM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u54a8\u8be2\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bcd\u6c47\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u54a8\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5341\u79cd\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u975e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\uff08BLEU\u3001ROUGE-L\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\uff08METEOR\u3001BERTScore\uff09\u548c grounding (RAGAS) \u6307\u6807\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c grounding\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4f1a\u60e9\u7f5a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u3001\u504f\u79bb\u901a\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u672c\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a agentic AI \u4e2d\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B.

The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task.

However, their tendency to hallucinate and their limitations in spatial retrieval and reasoning are well known, pointing to the need for novel solutions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising way to enhance LLMs with accurate, domain-specific, and timely information. Spatial RAG extends this approach to tasks involving geographic understanding. In this work, we introduce WalkRAG, a spatial RAG-based framework with a conversational interface for recommending walkable urban itineraries. Users can request routes that meet specific spatial constraints and preferences while interactively retrieving information about the path and points of interest (POIs) along the way. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of combining information retrieval, spatial reasoning, and LLMs to support urban discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a WalkRAG \u7684\u7a7a\u95f4 RAG \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u53ef\u6b65\u884c\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u884c\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210 (RAG) \u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u589e\u5f3a LLM \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u7a7a\u95f4 RAG \u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d89\u53ca\u5730\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a WalkRAG \u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4 RAG \u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u53ef\u6b65\u884c\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u884c\u7a0b\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf7\u6c42\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u6709\u5173\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6cbf\u9014\u5174\u8da3\u70b9 (POI) \u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c LLM \u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u57ce\u5e02\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c LLM \u6765\u652f\u6301\u57ce\u5e02\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

This design maintains header hierarchies, time labels, and units, ensuring that returned values are faithful to the original cells and straightforward to verify. Evaluated on multi-header corporate balance sheets, a heavily merged World Bank workbook, and diverse public datasets, SQuARE consistently surpasses single-strategy baselines and ChatGPT-4o on both retrieval precision and end-to-end answer accuracy while keeping latency predictable.

We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities.

However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

A recent approach to tackle this issue is to train a network with pristine face images that have been manipulated with hand-crafted artifacts to extract more generalizable clues. While effective for static images, extending this to the video domain is an open issue. Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing.

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u548c\u7eaf\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u6548\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) provide strong contextual reasoning, yet prior work mainly uses them as auxiliary modules to refine embeddings or adjust cluster boundaries. We propose ClusterFusion, a hybrid framework that instead treats the LLM as the clustering core, guided by lightweight embedding methods. The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains.

Modern blockchains use fast consensus protocols to avoid forking, improving throughput and finality. However, Ethereum's StateDB was designed for a forking chain that maintains multiple state versions. While newer blockchains adopt Ethereum's standard for DApp compatibility, they do not require multiple state versions, making legacy Ethereum databases inefficient for fast, non-forking blockchains. Moreover, existing StateDB implementations have been built on key-value stores (e.g., LevelDB), which make them less efficient.\n  This paper introduces a novel state database that is a native database implementation and maintains Ethereum compatibility while being specialized for non-forking blockchains.

Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A.

To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings.

While these interventions aim to modify specific information within models (e.g., removing virology content), their effects often propagate to related but unintended areas (e.g., allergies); these side-effects are commonly referred to as the ripple effect. In this work, we present RippleBench-Maker, an automatic tool for generating Q&A datasets that allow for the measurement of ripple effects in any model-editing task. RippleBench-Maker builds on a Wikipedia-based RAG pipeline (WikiRAG) to generate multiple-choice questions at varying semantic distances from the target concept (e.g., the knowledge being unlearned). Using this framework, we construct RippleBench-Bio, a benchmark derived from the WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Paper) dataset, a common unlearning benchmark. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art unlearning methods and find that all exhibit non-trivial accuracy drops on topics increasingly distant from the unlearned knowledge, each with distinct propagation profiles.

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bedEHR\u548c\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNLP\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4eba\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9EHR\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9bLLM\u5728zero-shot\u3001on-premises\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u75be\u75c5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bedEHR\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time.

However, naively replacing traditional I/O interfaces with io_uring does not necessarily yield performance benefits. To demonstrate when io_uring delivers the greatest benefits and how to use it effectively in modern database systems, we evaluate it in two use cases: Integrating io_uring into a storage-bound buffer manager and using it for high-throughput data shuffling in network-bound analytical workloads. We further analyze how advanced io_uring features, such as registered buffers and passthrough I/O, affect end-to-end performance. Our study shows when low-level optimizations translate into tangible system-wide gains and how architectural choices influence these benefits. Building on these insights, we derive practical guidelines for designing I/O-intensive systems using io_uring and validate their effectiveness in a case study of PostgreSQL's recent io_uring integration, where applying our guidelines yields a performance improvement of 14%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528 Linux io_uring \u63a5\u53e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684 I/O\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf I/O \u63a5\u53e3\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u7528 io_uring \u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf I/O \u63a5\u53e3\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 io_uring \u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b58\u50a8\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u6d17\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30 io_uring \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e95\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u4f55\u65f6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5207\u5b9e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u5728 PostgreSQL \u7684\u6700\u65b0 io_uring \u96c6\u6210\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u672c\u6587\u7684\u6307\u5357\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86 14% \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528 io_uring \u8bbe\u8ba1 I/O \u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional pipelines decouple detection, association, and tracking, leading to error propagation and temporal inconsistency in challenging scenarios. LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8bca\u65ad\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u521d\u7ea7\u4fdd\u5065\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u6025\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5934\u75db\u60a3\u8005\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u75c7\u72b6\u8868\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e03\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u592e\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u7531\u3002\u4f7f\u752890\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u75c5\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff08GPrompt\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u7684\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency.

Current theories of rich feature learning effects revolve around networks with one or two trainable layers or deep linear networks. Furthermore, even under such limiting settings, predictions often appear in the form of high-dimensional non-linear equations, which require computationally intensive numerical solutions. Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge. Here, we propose a powerful heuristic route for predicting the data and width scales at which various patterns of feature learning emerge. This form of scale analysis is considerably simpler than such exact theories and reproduces the scaling exponents of various known results.

Under Review", "summary": "Humans naturally perceive continuous experience as a hierarchy of temporally nested events, fine-grained actions embedded within coarser routines. Replicating this structure in computer vision requires models that can segment video not just retrospectively, but predictively and hierarchically. We introduce PARSE, a unified framework that learns multiscale event structure directly from streaming video without supervision. PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback. Event boundaries emerge naturally as transient peaks in prediction error, yielding temporally coherent, nested partonomies that mirror the containment relations observed in human event perception. Evaluated across three benchmarks, Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and Assembly 101, PARSE achieves state-of-the-art performance among streaming methods and rivals offline baselines in both temporal alignment (H-GEBD) and structural consistency (TED, hF1).

In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation.

These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations.

We introduce MoReGen, a motion-aware, physics-grounded T2V framework that integrates multi-agent LLMs, physics simulators, and renderers to generate reproducible, physically accurate videos from text prompts in the code domain. To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators.

Although embedding vector spaces are widely used to represent semantic closeness and are promising for analyzing text difficulty, the abundance of embedding methods creates a challenge in selecting the most suitable method. This study proposes the Educational Cone Model, which is a geometric framework based on the assumption that easier texts are less diverse (focusing on fundamental concepts), whereas harder texts are more diverse. This assumption leads to a cone-shaped distribution in the embedding space regardless of the embedding method used. The model frames the evaluation of embeddings as an optimization problem with the aim of detecting structured difficulty-based patterns. By designing specific loss functions, efficient closed-form solutions are derived that avoid costly computation. Empirical tests on real-world datasets validated the model's effectiveness and speed in identifying the embedding spaces that are best aligned with difficulty-annotated educational texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7684\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u4e0d\u5177\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u9525\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

While recent diffusion- and transformer-based models benefit from paired supervision from synthetic datasets, their generalization to diverse, real-world scenarios remains challenging. We propose ReasonX, a novel framework that leverages a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a perceptual judge providing relative intrinsic comparisons, and uses these comparisons as GRPO rewards for fine-tuning intrinsic decomposition models on unlabeled, in-the-wild images. Unlike RL methods for generative models, our framework aligns conditional intrinsic predictors by rewarding agreement between the judge's relational assessments and analytically derived relations from the model's outputs. ReasonX is model-agnostic and can be applied to different intrinsic predictors.

This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \\footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness.

However, they still struggle in complex real-world scenarios, where stance understanding requires dynamic background knowledge, target definitions involve compound entities or events that must be explicitly linked to stance labels, and rhetorical devices such as irony often obscure the author's actual intent. To address these challenges, we propose MSME, a Multi-Stage, Multi-Expert framework for zero-shot stance detection. MSME consists of three stages: (1) Knowledge Preparation, where relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified; (2) Expert Reasoning, involving three specialized modules-Knowledge Expert distills salient facts and reasons from a knowledge perspective, Label Expert refines stance labels and reasons accordingly, and Pragmatic Expert detects rhetorical cues such as irony to infer intent from a pragmatic angle; (3) Decision Aggregation, where a Meta-Judge integrates all expert analyses to produce the final stance prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that MSME achieves state-of-the-art performance across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSME\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u53cd\u8bbd\u7b49\u4fee\u8f9e\u624b\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u8bed\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMSME\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MSME\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We demonstrate a deep conditional-generative machine learning approach for the modelling of realistic activity schedules depending on input labels such as an individual's age, employment status, or other information relevant to their scheduling. We combine (i) a structured latent generative approach, with (ii) a conditional approach, through a novel Conditional VAE architecture. This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels.

To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about \"typical\" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues.

We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u8bc4\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5 virtue \u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a(i) \u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u57f9\u517b\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u4e60\u60ef\uff1b(ii) \u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u8651\u538b\u7f29\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u6a21\u7cca\u6743\u8861\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7406\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6027\u683c\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u3001\u4f19\u4f34\u6216\u73af\u5883\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e60\u60ef\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b(2) \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u516c\u5f0f\uff1b(3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b(4) \u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u67e5\u6216\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u62a5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u603b\u7ed3\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u9053\u5fb7\u6743\u8861\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u9053\u5fb7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u57f9\u517b\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u3002"}}

We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines.

Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $\u03ba> 0$.

This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests.

Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used.

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD.

To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively.

In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent.

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u89c4\u8303\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728 Sudoku \u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6c42\u89e3\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3 Transformer\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316 (GRPO) \u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u6392\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u81ea\u4e3e\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u5747\u8861\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u91cf\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u2014\u2014\u6700\u4f73\u6df7\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5728\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671d\u7740\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316 (GRPO) \u5bf9 Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5143\u683c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6df7\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5728\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671d\u7740\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting.

However, existing benchmarks are result-oriented and fail to systematically evaluate the legal intelligence of large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of legal GI. To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals. We believe LexGenius can assess the legal intelligence abilities of LLMs and enhance legal GI development.

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit.

From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens.

The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases.

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios.

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance.

However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates.

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u6570\u5b57\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9WebAgent\u5728\u771f\u5b9eWeb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u5f0f\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6458\u8981\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30WebAgent\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645Web\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30WebAgent\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u521b\u5efa25,000\u5230150,000\u4e2atoken\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude-3.7\u3001GPT-4.1\u3001Llama 4\u548co4-mini\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece\u57fa\u7ebf\u6761\u4ef6\u768440-50%\u964d\u81f3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u768410%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72WebAgent\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u3002"}}

Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures.

This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix.

This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging.

Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement.

Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (DDRL) \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411 KL \u6563\u5ea6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0 RL \u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u9020\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u8be5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "method": "DDRL \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u6269\u6563\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "DDRL \u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a GPU \u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4e00\u4e07\u4e2a\u53cc\u76f2\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "DDRL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm.

Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework consistently improves editing reliability and generalization under real-world evaluations, while better preserving locality and pre-trained capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u8303\u5f0f Edit-then-Consolidate\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) \u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) \u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e CoT \u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation.

Understanding where and how these subtle failures occur in an application relies on evaluation methods known as \\textit{evals}. Prior work focuses on defining new eval methods or benchmark datasets for specific tasks. However, neither helps a software team with a task-specific FM application when there is no metric or dataset. The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering. A preliminary evaluation on the quality of our selected evals shows 93\\% and 90\\% accuracy respectively.

Yet, systematic evaluation of these models, especially for languages beyond English, remains limited. \"Challenging the Abilities of LAnguage Models in ITAlian\" (CALAMITA) is a large-scale collaborative benchmarking initiative for Italian, coordinated under the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics. Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models.

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief.

This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs.

We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset.

Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edfSmartAlert\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed9\u60a3\u8005\u5e26\u6765\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210SmartAlert\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u5bb6\u533b\u9662\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u6025\u75c7\u62a4\u7406\u75c5\u623f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf99270\u540d\u5165\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5168\u8840\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\uff08CBC\uff09\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728SmartAlert\u663e\u793a\u540e\u768452\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\uff0cCBC\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff081.54 vs 1.82\uff0cp <0.01\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5bf9\u6b21\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u679c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8615%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CDS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u5468\u5bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks.

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DSS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u6362\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u82f1\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u6362\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u89c9\u6216\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bd5\u56fe\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u6765\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86PlayeRank\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6539\u7528\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u603b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0a\u573a\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5c06\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u751f\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff08\u75b2\u52b3\uff09\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u53d7\u6218\u672f\u89d2\u8272\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u7eaa\u5f8b\u98ce\u9669\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u6362\u4eba\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff08P final\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57282018\u5e74FIFA\u4e16\u754c\u676f\u5df4\u897f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5df2\u6267\u884c\u6362\u4eba\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u52a0\u5e03\u91cc\u57c3\u5c14\u00b7\u70ed\u82cf\u65af\uff09\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9ec4\u724c\u51fa\u73b0\u524d\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u6807\u8bb0\u4e86\u201cFAGNER\u6096\u8bba\u201d\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u98ce\u9669\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u201c\u5362\u5361\u5e93\u6096\u8bba\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u52a9\u653b\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We address the challenge of segmenting mixed-authorship text, that is identifying transition points in text where authorship shifts from human to AI or vice-versa, a problem with critical implications for authenticity, trust, and human oversight. We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTeP-Diff\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5efa\u7b51\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6613\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STeP-Diff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528DeepONet\u6a21\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408PDE\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8659\u4e2a\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c14\u5929\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u597d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSTeP-Diff\u5728MAE\u3001RMSE\u548cMAPE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8689.12%\u300182.30%\u548c25.00%\u3002", "conclusion": "STeP-Diff\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code.

We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning.

We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation.

Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories.

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEAL: A new two-stage semantic parsing framework using self-evolving agentic learning to improve accuracy and efficiency in knowledge-based conversational question answering (KBCQA).", "motivation": "Existing KBCQA approaches struggle with coreference resolution, contextual dependency modeling, and complex logical reasoning, leading to structural inaccuracies and high computational costs.", "method": "A two-stage semantic parsing framework (SEAL) is introduced, featuring LLM-based S-expression core extraction and agentic calibration, followed by template-based completion.

However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSANTA\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7f13\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08SANTA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u9664\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002SANTA\u91c7\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8bc6\u522bMLLM\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5b57\u5e55\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9-\u77ed\u8bed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSANTA\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SANTA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction.

The former incurs significant computational overhead during cost aggregation, whereas the latter often lacks the ability to model non-local contextual information. These methods exhibit poor compatibility on resource-constrained mobile devices, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. To address this, we propose a Multi-frequency Adaptive Fusion Network (MAFNet), which can produce high-quality disparity maps using only efficient 2D convolutions. Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAFNet significantly outperforms existing real-time methods on public datasets such as Scene Flow and KITTI 2015, showing a favorable balance between accuracy and real-time performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7f51\u7edcMAFNet\uff0c\u5b83\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u6548\u76842D\u5377\u79ef\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u5dee\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u524d\u8005\u5728\u4ee3\u4ef7\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6267\u884c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLinformer\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Scene Flow\u548cKITTI 2015\u7b49\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MAFNet\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MAFNet\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, this transition is significantly impeded by the lack of scalable infrastructure capable of constructing high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive method designed to systematically scale the diversity and complexity of interactive environments. Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis.

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCXL-NDP\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u5230CXL\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u4e13\u5bb6\u6743\u91cd\u8d85\u8fc7GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u653e\u7f6e\uff1b2. \u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u70ed\u4e13\u5bb6\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728GPU\u7aef\u7684HBM\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5230CXL-NDP\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u914dbitwidth\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPU-NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4state-of-the-art\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe8.7\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4ec5\u4e3a0.13%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CXL-NDP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5378\u8f7d\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks.

However, training these agents through direct, continuous interaction with diverse tools is often prohibitively expensive, slow, and introduces additional development and maintenance overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce the Generalist Tool Model (GTM), a 1.5-billion-parameter model that learns to act as a universal tool simulator. With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability.

However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8003\u8651\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u91cf\u5316\u53d7\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08PSCA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u539f\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u91cd\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PSCA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PSCA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation.

Finally, the chapter examines ethical questions that arise specifically from generative AI's mimetic generativity, such as debates about authorship and credit, the emergence of as-if social relationships with machines, and new forms of influence, persuasion, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u4eba\u4eec\u4f53\u9a8c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u5b83\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u5165\u95e8\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u52a0\u5267\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f26\u7406\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f02\u5316\u548c\u5265\u524a\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u751f\u6210\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u751f\u6210\u6027\u6240\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5173\u4e8e\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u7f72\u540d\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u8bf4\u670d\u548c\u64cd\u7eb5\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6b65\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6Arbitrage\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6b65\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cArbitrage\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6b65\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea62\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Arbitrage \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis.

In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0InceptionV3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cInceptionV3\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002ResNet\u7cfb\u5217\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u8868\u73b0\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u597d\uff0c\u800cVGG16\u548cAlexNet\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57df\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial.

To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones.

However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks.

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks.

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684conformal prediction (CP)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2aconformal predictor\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230CP\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4f8b\u5b50\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of \"context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off\". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned \"what-if\" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization.

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(llms)\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9879\u76ee\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u96be\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684llm\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u679a\u4e3e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u679a\u4e3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5305\u62ecllm\u5728\u5185\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5404\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u51fa\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u5b57\u6bcd\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u5217\u8868\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u547d\u540d\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a2\u6d4bllm\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4f46\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u8ba1\u6570\u539f\u7406\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u662f\u5426\u9075\u5faa\u7f29\u653e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u679a\u4e3e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bllm\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f53\u4ec5\u8981\u6c42\u679a\u4e3e\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1llm\u5177\u6709\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios.

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches.

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684actor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fLLM\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u975e\u6807\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3aLLM\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3LLM agent\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c42\u9762\u5956\u52b1\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u884c\u52a8\u4f4d\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00Actor-Critic (NLAC) \u7684\u65b0\u9896actor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fLLM\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u975e\u6807\u91cf\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u6d4f\u89c8\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e2d\uff0cNLAC\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aLLM agent\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "NLAC \u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a LLM agent \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism.

However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems.

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks.

A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios.

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case.

However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks.

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD.
