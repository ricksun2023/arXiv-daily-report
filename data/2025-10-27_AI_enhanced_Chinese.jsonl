However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or\ncategories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In\ncontrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with\ndetailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify\nwhether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a\nmethodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a\ncomprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched\nmetadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full\nversion is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable\nthresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download\nand use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce\nthe full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity\nscores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures\nidentify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses\nin Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.\nFinally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation\nof POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial\nanalyses and a range of downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Foursquare\u548cOpenStreetMap (OSM) \u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5229\u7528Foursquare\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5546\u4e1aPOI\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cOSM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "Foursquare\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800cOSM\u867d\u7136\u8be6\u7ec6\u4f46\u672a\u6b63\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1POI\u662f\u5426\u4ee3\u8868\u5b9e\u9645\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97Foursquare\u548cOSM POI\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5f55\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5339\u914d\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u7684POI\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fc7\u6ee4\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a631GB\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u4e86Foursquare\u548cOSM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684POI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}
