### [1] [DrDiff: Dynamic Routing Diffusion with Hierarchical Attention for Breaking the Efficiency-Quality Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02785)
*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Zimeng Huang,Xiaofei Sun,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrDiff是一个用于长文本生成的新框架，它通过动态专家调度、分层稀疏注意力和软吸收指导优化来克服效率与质量之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本生成方法在效率和质量之间存在权衡，DrDiff旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该论文提出了三个核心技术：动态专家调度机制、分层稀疏注意力（HSA）机制和软吸收指导优化策略。

Result: 在各种长文本生成基准上的综合实验表明，DrDiff优于现有的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: DrDiff通过其核心技术，能够更有效地生成高质量的长文本。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

### [2] [SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830)
*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对几种参数高效微调（PEFT）方法在语音识别任务中进行了集成和基准测试，并提出了一种新的结构化SVD引导的微调方法（SSVD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法主要针对语言和视觉任务开发，在语音领域的验证有限。为了解决这个问题，本文旨在对这些方法在语音识别中进行全面的集成和评估。

Method: 本文在ESPnet中集成了LoRA及其变体（VeRA, DoRA, PiSSA, SVFT），并提出了SSVD微调方法，该方法选择性地旋转输入相关的右奇异向量，同时保持输出相关的向量固定。

Result: 本文在领域转移的语音识别任务（包括儿童语音和方言变异）上，对所有方法进行了评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B。

Conclusion: 本文发布了所有在ESPnet中的实现，以支持可重复性和未来的工作。SSVD微调方法在保持语义映射的同时，实现了鲁棒的领域自适应，且具有最小的可训练参数和更高的效率。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

### [3] [Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834)
*Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Simone Hashiguti,Helena Maia,Nadia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型如何构建关于葡萄牙语短篇小说中黑人和白人女性的叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解大型语言模型如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事。

Method: 从2100篇文本中，应用计算方法对语义相似的故事进行分组，然后进行定性分析。

Result: 研究揭示了三种主要的叙事表征：社会克服、祖先神化和主观自我实现。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了语法连贯、看似中立的文本如何将女性身体物化为一种结晶化的、殖民地结构的框架，从而强化了历史不平等。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

### [4] [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855)
*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究关注大型语言模型(llm)在开放式注释任务中的应用，并提出了一种名为IDEAlgin的新的评估范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估由llm生成的注释与专家生成的注释是否一致具有挑战性，目前还没有经过验证的、可扩展的衡量思想相似性的方法。

Method: 提出了IDEAlgin，这是一种直观的基准测试范例，用于通过“挑出异类”的三元组判断任务来捕获专家相似性评级，并评估各种相似性指标。

Result: 矢量度量在很大程度上未能捕捉到对专家有意义的细微相似性维度。通过IDEAlgin提示llm可以显著提高与专家判断的一致性(提高9-30%)。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin是一个有前途的范例，用于大规模评估llm与开放式专家注释的对比，从而为llm在教育及其他领域的负责任部署提供信息。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

### [5] [A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864)
*Kesen Wang,Daulet Toibazar,Pedro J. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的、自我演进的对抗性工作流程，用于生成阿拉伯语长文本的问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高阿拉伯语大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)在长文本理解方面的能力。

Method: 通过协调多个专门的LVLM(包括问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群)来迭代改进自身的性能，无需任何人工干预。该系统从原始的多页阿拉伯语文档开始，问题生成器生成细粒度的、上下文相关的查询，由答案生成器群处理，评估器评估并反馈质量指标。

Result: 该自我演进的工作流程明显优于静态管道，显著提高了领先的阿拉伯语大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)的长文本理解能力。同时发布了一个名为AraLongBench的大规模阿拉伯语基准测试，其中包含数百页的单页和多页挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的、自动化的方法，可以提高阿拉伯语LVLM在长文本问答方面的性能。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

### [6] [Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908)
*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用Transformer模型检测在线语篇中的少数群体压力，并发现图结构整合能持续提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体面临更高的健康问题和精神障碍风险，这主要源于Meyer(2003)提出的少数群体压力模型。本研究旨在对基于Transformer的架构进行全面评估，以检测在线讨论中的少数群体压力。

Method: 研究采用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa和BART等Transformer模型，并与传统机器学习基线和图增强变体进行对比。同时，评估了零样本和小样本学习范式在代表性不足的数据集上的适用性。实验在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行，包含12,645和5,789个帖子，并重复五次以确保稳健性。

Result: 结果表明，整合图结构能够持续提升Transformer模型的检测性能，并且有关系上下文的监督微调优于零样本和小样本方法。

Conclusion: 通过图增强来建模社会连接和对话上下文，能够提高模型识别关键语言标记的能力，如图形增强的Transformer为数字健康干预和公共卫生政策提供了最可靠的基础。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

### [7] [English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915)
*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究表明，通过 LoRA 调整的多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 可以同时执行自动发音评估 (APA) 和发音错误检测与诊断 (MDD)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，APA 和 MDD 需要复杂的架构更改或单独的训练程序，而本研究旨在消除这些需求。

Method: 利用微软的 Phi-4-multimodal-instruct，通过 LoRA 在 Speechocean762 数据集上进行微调。

Result: 模型预测的发音评估分数与人工分配的分数表现出很强的皮尔逊相关系数 (PCC > 0.7)，同时实现了较低的词错误率 (WER) 和音素错误率 (PER)（均 < 0.15）。

Conclusion: 通过调整大型多模态模型，无需完全微调，即可建立集成的发音评估系统。这种高效的基于 LoRA 的方法为 L2 英语学习者提供了更易于访问、集成和有效的计算机辅助发音训练 (CAPT) 技术。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

### [8] [Decoding the Rule Book: Extracting Hidden Moderation Criteria from Reddit Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02926)
*Youngwoo Kim,Himanshu Beniwal,Steven L. Johnson,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究从历史审核数据中识别并提取在线社区中隐含的审核标准，利用可解释的架构将审核标准表示为与内容删除相关的词汇表达式的评分表，从而可以系统地比较不同社区的标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的内容审核系统需要明确的分类标准，但在线社区通常采用多样化、隐式的标准。本研究旨在揭示这些隐式标准。

Method: 使用可解释的架构，从历史审核数据中识别和提取与内容删除相关的词汇表达式，并将其表示为评分表。

Result: 提取的词汇模式能够有效地复制神经审核模型的性能，同时提供对决策过程的透明见解。生成的标准矩阵揭示了表面上共享的规范在实际执行方式上的显著差异。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了以前未被记录的审核模式，包括社区对语言的特定容忍度、主题限制的特征以及有害言论分类的潜在子类别。

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

### [9] [Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020)
*Chang Su,Dengliang Shi,Siyuan Huang,Jintao Du,Changhua Meng,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练方法，通过在对比学习前增加一个训练阶段来丰富 final token embedding 的语义，从而提高 LLM 在文本嵌入任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 LLM 的文本嵌入方法通常利用 final token 的嵌入，但这些 tokens 并没有经过专门的训练来捕捉整个上下文的语义，限制了它们作为文本嵌入的能力，尤其是在检索和重排序任务中。

Method: 在对比学习之前增加一个新的训练阶段。这个阶段采用双向生成重构任务，即 EBQ2D 和 EBD2Q，它们交错进行，以锚定 [EOS] 嵌入并重建 Query-Document 对的每一侧。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们额外的训练阶段显著提高了 LLM 在 MTEB 上的性能，在不同的 LLM 基础模型和规模上取得了新的最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过提出的训练方法，可以显著提高 LLM 在文本嵌入任务中的性能，并在 MTEB 基准测试上取得了新的 SOTA 结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Susan Holm,Yuran Wang,Vincent Zhou,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估装配任务助手的多模态QA数据集ProMQA-Assembly，包含391个QA对，需要理解人类活动记录和说明手册。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏在实际环境中支持面向应用的系统评估的测试平台，特别是在装配领域。

Method: 采用半自动QA标注方法，利用LLM生成候选答案，人工验证，并整合细粒度的动作标签以丰富问题类型；创建指令任务图，用于基准测试和辅助人工验证。

Result: 基准测试结果表明，现有模型仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 新的评估数据集有助于程序活动助手的进一步发展。

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

*Yougen Zhou,Ningning Zhou,Qin Chen,Jie Zhou,Aimin Zhou,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个基于认知行为疗法（CBT）的长期对话语料库，以解决心理咨询对话数据集的缺乏问题，旨在提升大型语言模型在心理健康服务中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于社会偏见和治疗师资源的限制，心理治疗的覆盖面有限。大型语言模型在具备心理治疗技能后，有望扩展心理健康服务的可及性。然而，缺乏心理咨询对话数据集是开发有效对话agent的主要挑战。

Method: 构建了一个基于认知行为疗法（CBT）的长期对话语料库DiaCBT，包含多次咨询session和认知概念化图（CCDs），用于指导不同场景下的客户模拟。训练了一个深度咨询模型，并提出了一个综合评估框架，以CBT为基础，评估其性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiaCBT有效地提高了大型语言模型模拟具有CBT专业知识的心理学家的能力。

Conclusion: DiaCBT具有训练更专业的咨询agent的潜力，强调了其在心理健康服务领域的价值。

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

*Fong-Chun Tsai,Kuan-Tang Huang,Bi-Cheng Yan,Tien-Hong Lo,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的目标函数 Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss，用于训练 ASA 模型，以改善少数类别的特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASA 模型常常受到类别不平衡的影响，导致有偏见的预测。

Method: 通过扰动模型预测来改善少数类别的特征表示，而无需修改数据集。

Result: 在 ICNALE 基准数据集上的评估表明，将 BLV loss 整合到基于文本的 (BERT) 模型中，显著提高了分类准确率和公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法使自动语音评估对于不同的学习者来说更加稳健。

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构可学习机制的adapter微调方法，以解决大型语言模型微调中的参数冗余、结构僵化和任务适应性有限等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中的参数冗余、结构僵化和任务适应性有限等问题。

Method: 通过引入可微门控函数和结构稀疏控制变量，实现adapter插入点、激活路径和模块组合的自动优化。使用结构搜索机制来指导训练期间特定任务的高效子结构的动态构建。

Result: 该方法在多个任务上优于主流的参数高效微调技术。在准确性、压缩率以及对噪声和扰动的鲁棒性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 验证了该方法在各种多任务自然语言理解任务中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文使用长短期记忆（LSTM）进行商业情感分析，LSTM 是一种循环神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业情感分析是自然语言处理中重要且热门的主题之一。不同类型的情感分析技术（如基于词典的技术和不同类型的机器学习算法）被应用于不同语言（如英语、印地语、西班牙语等）的情感分析。

Method: 使用改进的 LSTM 模型来防止梯度消失问题，而不是应用传统的循环神经网络 (RNN)。

Result: 改进的 RNN 模型达到了约 91.33% 的准确率，优于其他传统 RNN 模型。

Conclusion: 通过应用该模型，任何商业公司或电子商务网站都可以识别客户对其不同类型产品的反馈，从而评估其营销策略。

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

### [15] [Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03116)
*Hauke Licht,Rupak Sarkar,Patrick Y. Wu,Pranav Goel,Niklas Stoehr,Elliott Ash,Alexander Miserlis Hoyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)是衡量标量结构的有吸引力的工具，但它们对数值输出的特殊处理提出了如何最好地应用它们的问题。本文对基于llm的社会科学标量结构测量方法进行了综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多描述语言的结构，如其复杂性或情感性，具有自然的连续语义结构；公众演讲不仅仅是“简单”或“复杂”，而是存在于极端之间的连续统一体上。

Method: 使用来自政治学文献的多个数据集，我们评估了四种方法：未加权直接逐点评分、成对比较聚合、token-概率加权逐点评分和微调。

Result: 直接从文本生成逐点分数的llm产生不连续的分布，并在任意数字处聚集。测量的质量随着llm进行的成对比较而提高，但通过获取逐点分数并按token概率对其进行加权，可以进一步提高测量质量。使用少至1000个训练对微调较小的模型可以匹配或超过提示llm的性能。

Conclusion: 基于llm的社会科学标量结构测量方法，pairwise比较和token-概率加权可以提高测量质量，微调小模型可以匹配或超过prompted LLM的性能

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

TL;DR: 知识编辑为LLM指纹注入提供了一种轻量级的替代方案，但大规模微调后性能会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的知识产权（IP）保护越来越重要。通过指令调整将专门的指纹注入LLM是一种常见的IP保护技术，但会显著降低模型性能，需要大量的计算资源，并且在模型修改下的持久性较差。

Method: 应用知识编辑进行指纹注入，并提出指纹子空间感知微调（FSFT），通过约束指纹子空间的更新来减少指纹退化。

Result: 即使在最坏的情况下，FSFT的性能也比微调高出10%。

Conclusion: 指纹注入的模型难以区分指纹和相似文本，因此迫切需要更强大和细粒度的LLM指纹注入方法。

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了爱沙尼亚语的词汇处理，通过结合词语命名任务和眼动追踪的大规模单subject实验，分析了五个响应变量，并使用广义加性模型。关注的是由心理词汇的计算模型（区分性词汇模型，DLM）生成的词汇处理测量是否可以预测这些响应变量，以及它们与经典预测因子（如词频、邻域大小和屈折范式大小）相比如何。计算模型通过线性和深度映射实现。主要发现是：DLM-based测量是词汇处理的有力预测因子；使用深度学习的DLM-measures不一定比使用线性映射的DLM-measures更精确；经典预测因子与DLM-based预测因子相比，往往提供更精确的拟合（除了总注视时间，两者提供等效的拟合优度）；在命名任务中，词汇变量不能预测首次注视时间和总注视次数。由于DLM使用从形式到意义的映射，因此基于DLM的测量对总注视时间、命名潜伏期和口语单词持续时间的可预测性表明，意义与当前的单词命名任务密切相关。

Motivation: 研究爱沙尼亚语中的词汇处理，并检验计算模型（DLM）在预测词汇处理过程中的作用，以及与传统预测因子的比较。

Method: 结合词语命名任务和眼动追踪的大规模单subject实验，使用广义加性模型分析五个响应变量（首次注视时间、总注视时间、注视次数、词语命名潜伏期和口语单词持续时间）。使用线性映射和深度映射实现计算模型。

Result: DLM-based测量是词汇处理的有力预测因子。使用深度学习的DLM-measures不一定比使用线性映射的DLM-measures更精确。经典预测因子与DLM-based预测因子相比，往往提供更精确的拟合（总注视时间除外）。词汇变量不能预测首次注视时间和总注视次数。DLM-based测量对总注视时间、命名潜伏期和口语单词持续时间具有预测性。

Conclusion: 意义与当前的单词命名任务密切相关。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++

automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了直接调整预训练LLM以处理过程数据，无需自然语言重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PM应用主要集中在使用prompt工程或将事件日志转换为叙述式数据集。直接调整LLM可以避免这些步骤，并可能更有效地利用LLM的序列生成能力。

Method: 采用参数高效的微调技术，以降低计算开销。重点关注预测过程监控（PPM），并考虑单任务和多任务预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多任务设置中，预测性能优于最先进的RNN方法和最近的基于叙述式解决方案。微调模型收敛速度更快，需要的超参数优化也更少。

Conclusion: 直接调整LLM在预测过程监控方面具有潜力，尤其是在多任务设置中。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Motivation: 现有LLMs的评估主要集中在英语和全球性主题上，忽略了低资源语言和文化特定内容。现有的多语言基准测试依赖自动翻译，会引入错误并歪曲文化背景。

Method: 论文构建了SinhalaMMLU数据集，包含7000多个问题，涵盖斯里兰卡国家课程的六个领域和30个科目，包括一般学术主题和文化知识。使用该数据集评估了26个LLMs。

Result: Claude 3.5 sonnet和GPT-4o取得了最高的平均准确率，分别为67%和62%，但总体模型性能仍然有限。模型在人文等文化领域表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在适应低资源和文化特定环境方面仍有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching
language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes
on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact

Motivation: 现有的推理LLM在多智能体系统中进行故障归因时的准确率非常低，通常低于10%。

Method: 通过反事实重放和编程故障注入来注释失败的多智能体轨迹，生成数据集TracerTraj。利用该资源，开发了AgenTracer-8B，一个用多粒度强化学习训练的轻量级故障追踪器。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，AgenTracer-8B的性能优于Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM，高达18.18%，并在MetaGPT和MaAS等现成的多智能体系统中实现了4.8-14.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AgenTracer-8B为多智能体系统的故障归因提供了一种新的标准，并能够为现成的多智能体系统提供可操作的反馈，从而实现自我纠正和自我进化的智能体AI。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Motivation: 了解语言模型如何将数据转化为知识表示，从而开发出更一致、鲁棒和完整的知识表示模型。

Method: 提出了LMEnt，包含基于维基百科的知识丰富预训练语料库，以及一种实体检索方法。

Result: 实体检索方法比以前的方法提高了80.4%，并发布了12个预训练模型，其性能与流行的开源模型相当。研究表明，事实频率是关键，但不能完全解释学习趋势。

Conclusion: LMEnt提供了一个受控环境，用于分析预训练中实体提及与下游性能之间的联系，以及预训练数据中因果干预的影响。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Motivation: 理解成功的预训练机制，并确定预训练准确率和分类任务微调之间的相互作用。

Method: 使用在Wikipedia数据集上预训练的BERT-6架构，并在FewRel和DBpedia分类任务上进行微调。

Result: 结果表明，token的准确率(APT)随着其在数据集中出现的频率而增加，并且所有token的平均值可以量化预训练的成功程度。预训练打破了token之间的对称性，并将它们分成有限的、小的、强匹配的token集群。输出标签预测置信度与平均输入APT无关。图像分类任务中预训练的潜在机制与NLP分类任务中使用的机制相似。

Conclusion: 预训练可以生成更高阶的语言结构，即使学习成本函数仅用于识别单个token。预训练的发现反映在transformer块中提高的微调准确率上。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

Motivation: 沙特阿拉伯有超过 84,000 人依赖沙特手语 (SSL) 作为主要的沟通方式。但现有技术对于阿拉伯语手语（如 SSL）的精确和可靠的翻译技术仍然存在迫切需求。现有解决方案主要集中于非阿拉伯语手语，导致专门用于阿拉伯语手语（特别是 SSL）的资源严重不足。

Method: 本文构建了首个连续沙特手语数据集 KAU-CSSL，并提出了一个基于 Transformer 的模型，该模型利用预训练的 ResNet-18 进行空间特征提取，并使用带有双向 LSTM 的 Transformer 编码器来处理时间依赖性。

Result: 该模型在signer dependent模式下达到 99.02% 的准确率，在signer independent 模式下达到 77.71% 的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项研究不仅改进了 SSL 社区的沟通工具，而且为更广泛的手语领域做出了重大贡献。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视频多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在像素级视觉定位中对运动的利用能力，并提出了一个新的运动中心基准测试(MoCentric-Bench)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试在评估视频 MLLMs 的运动理解能力方面存在不足，因为它们往往可以通过单帧图像捕捉到运动信息，而不需要真正的时间推理。

Method: 论文提出了四种运动中心探测技术，用于评估视频 MLLMs 识别真假运动以及理解运动顺序的能力。同时构建了一个新的运动中心基准测试 MoCentric-Bench。

Result: 论文发现，现有的视频 MLLMs 在运动理解方面表现不佳，单帧图像基线方法甚至可以与或超过现有方法。通过简单的运动中心自适应技术，可以在 MoCentric-Bench 上获得最佳性能。

Conclusion: 论文的运动中心基准测试、评估方法和实验结果对未来的模型提出了挑战，要求其提高在视频中进行密集时空定位和像素级理解的能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的主动视频采集框架，用于动态选择每个患者最具信息量的超声心动图视频，以解决主动脉瓣狭窄（AS）诊断中超声心动图（echo）资源有限和操作者专业知识的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉瓣狭窄（AS）是一种危及生命的疾病，由主动脉瓣狭窄导致血流受损。尽管其患病率很高，但由于资源限制，尤其是在农村和欠发达地区，获得作为金标准诊断工具的超声心动图（echo）的机会通常受到限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的主动视频采集框架，该框架动态地选择每个患者最具信息量的超声心动图视频。与依赖于一组固定视频的传统方法不同，该方法持续评估是否需要额外的成像，从而优化了准确性和效率。

Result: 在来自 2,572 名患者的数据上进行测试，该方法实现了 80.6% 的分类准确率，同时仅使用了完整采集的 47% 的超声心动图视频。

Conclusion: 主动特征采集具有增强 AS 诊断的潜力，使超声心动图评估更高效、可扩展和个性化。

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic integration is a promising paradigm for building clinically robust and domain-invariant medical AI systems.

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Method: STAR集成了染色条件预处理和分层粗到细相关策略，自适应内核缩放和内置质量控制。

Result: STAR在ANHIR 2019和ACROBAT 2022数据集上进行了评估，这些数据集涵盖多个器官和扫描条件，STAR始终如一地在每张幻灯片几分钟内产生稳定的对齐，证明了对交叉染色变异性和部分组织重叠的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个开放且轻量级的工具发布，提供了一个可重现的基线，降低了临床采用的门槛，并为下一代计算病理学实现了大规模配对数据准备。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常无法捕获精细的日珥结构，特别是倒钩，因为它们建模远程依赖和空间细节的能力有限。

Method: 提出EdgeAttNet，一种基于U-Net主干网的分割架构，通过引入一种新颖的、可学习的边缘图，该边缘图直接从输入图像中导出。该边缘图通过使用边缘信息线性变换注意力Key和Query矩阵来整合到模型中，从而在网络的瓶颈处引导自注意力机制，以更有效地捕获日珥边界和倒钩。

Result: EdgeAttNet在MAGFILO数据集上优于U-Net和其他基于U-Net的Transformer基线。它实现了更高的分割精度和对日珥倒钩的显着更好的识别，具有更快的推理性能，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: EdgeAttNet通过显式地将这种结构先验整合到注意力计算中，增强了空间敏感性和分割精度，同时减少了可训练参数的数量。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在场景动态和领域知识方面存在不足。

Method: KEPT 结合了 TFSF 视频编码器（通过自监督学习训练）和一个可扩展的 k-means + HNSW 检索堆栈（提供场景对齐的范例）。

Result: 在 nuScenes 数据集上评估，KEPT 在开放循环协议中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 检索增强、CoT 指导的 VLM 为可解释和值得信赖的自动驾驶提供了一条有前景的、数据高效的途径。

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstaDA，一个新颖的、无需训练的双代理系统，旨在增强实例分割数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究缺乏大型语言模型（LLM）和扩散模型之间的深度协作，并且未能充分利用现有训练数据中的丰富信息。

Method: 引入文本代理（T-Agent），通过LLM和扩散模型之间的协作来增强数据多样性，并具有Prompt Rethink机制，迭代优化prompt。同时，提出了图像代理（I-Agent），旨在丰富整体数据分布，通过生成以训练图像为条件的新实例来扩充训练集。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上进行的实验表明，InstaDA取得了显著的改进，box AP提高了+4.0，mask AP提高了+3.3。并且优于DiverGen模型。

Conclusion: InstaDA在实例分割任务上表现出色，尤其是在常见类别和频繁类别上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于少样本医学图像分割的自引导原型增强网络(SPENet)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的少样本医学图像分割方法忽略了类内差异，且支持图像中的并非所有局部原型都有利于匹配。

Method: 提出了一个多层次原型生成(MPG)模块，同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型。提出了一个查询引导的局部原型增强(QLPE)模块，通过结合来自查询图像的指导来自适应地细化支持原型。

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPENet在少样本医学图像分割任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

### [45] [SOPSeg: Prompt-based Small Object Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03002)
*Chenhao Wang,Yingrui Ji,Yu Meng,Yunjian Zhang,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SOPSeg的prompt-based框架，专门用于遥感图像中的小目标分割。该框架包含区域自适应放大策略、定制解码器和一种新颖的prompting机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要集中于小目标检测，而小目标实例分割仍未被充分探索，且缺乏专用数据集。SAM模型在小目标分割上的性能显著下降，主要是由于粗糙的1/16特征分辨率导致精细空间细节的严重丢失。

Method: SOPSeg包含一个区域自适应放大策略，以保持精细的细节，并采用一个定制的解码器，该解码器集成了边缘预测和渐进式细化，以实现精确的边界划分。此外，还引入了一种为遥感应用中广泛采用的面向边界框量身定制的新型prompting机制。

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割方面优于现有方法，并有助于为遥感任务构建高效的数据集。

Conclusion: 本文构建了一个基于SODA-A的综合小目标实例分割数据集，并将发布模型和数据集以支持未来的研究。

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后处理水印可以应用于任何生成模型的输出，无需访问模型的内部结构，并且允许用户将唯一的水印嵌入到单独的图像中。为了提高鲁棒性，在训练过程中加入了集成攻击网络。

Method: 使用CNN和Transformer在空间和频率域构建了各种版本的攻击网络，以研究每种组合如何影响水印模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 结果表明，在空间域中结合基于CNN的攻击网络和在频率域中结合基于Transformer的攻击网络可以产生最高的水印模型鲁棒性。在WAVES基准上进行了广泛的评估，使用平均比特精度作为指标，表明我们的集成攻击网络显着提高了基线水印方法在各种压力测试下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对于WAVES中定义的再生攻击，我们的方法将StegaStamp提高了18.743%。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

structured, interpretable descriptions aligned with clinical practice and
provides MES classification and lesion tags. Compared with baselines, our
approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy, supporting
reliable endoscopic reporting.

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在缺乏视觉证据的情况下，经常错误地认为文本输入是图像的一部分，导致错误的响应。本文旨在探讨LVLMs是否具备判断文本概念是否以图像为基础的内部能力。通过研究，发现前馈网络(FFN)神经元的一个特定子集，称为视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元，始终通过独特的激活模式来表示视觉缺失。利用这些模式，本文开发了一个检测模块，可以系统地分类输入token是否以视觉为基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)通过共同解释视觉和文本输入来生成上下文相关的响应。但是，它们经常错误地将缺乏视觉证据的文本输入视为图像的一部分，从而导致错误的响应。

Method: 1. 探究LVLMs是否具有确定文本概念是否以图像为基础的内部能力。
2. 发现FFN神经元的一个特定子集，称为视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元，该神经元通过独特的激活模式来表示视觉缺失。
3. 利用这些模式，开发了一个检测模块，该模块可以系统地对输入token是否以视觉为基础进行分类。

Result: 大量的实验表明，该方法有效地缓解了模型错误地假定文本输入在视觉上存在的趋势，并且该方法在各种LVLM中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LVLMs在处理视觉和文本输入时存在的问题，并提出了一种有效的方法来缓解这些问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Result: 在四个 ReID 基准数据集上进行了综合实验，结果表明该方法有效且通用，结果与当前最先进的方法相匹配或超过了它们。

Conclusion: 该模型能够主动抑制噪声背景区域，并增强对身份相关的前景线索的关注。

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: MedLiteNet: A lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid for skin-lesion segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation is challenging due to the limitations of CNNs in modeling long-range dependencies and the high complexity of Vision Transformers on small datasets.

Method: A lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid (MedLiteNet) with hierarchical feature extraction, multi-scale context aggregation, depth-wise Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks, cross-scale token-mixing, and a boundary-aware self-attention module.

Result: Achieves high precision in dermoscopic segmentation.

Conclusion: MedLiteNet is tailored for dermoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的条件扩散模型难以利用多任务场景中的内在相关性，尤其是在缺乏训练数据的ill-posed任务中。传统静态条件控制难以适应多任务场景的动态演化特性。

Method: 该范式解耦了扩散和条件生成过程，避免了扩散模型对ill-posed任务中监督数据的依赖。动态条件通过相同的噪声调度生成，逐步调整其统计特性，自然地嵌入时间相关信息，降低网络学习的难度。

Result: 在去雾和可见-红外融合等典型的ill-posed多任务场景中，在公共数据集上取得了多个指标的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 提出的动态条件双扩散桥训练范式在解决ill-posed多任务问题上具有优越性。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统容易受到使用用户面部照片的非法认证尝试（例如欺骗攻击）的攻击。为了防止此类欺骗攻击，至关重要的是在人脸识别过程之前区分输入图像是真实用户图像还是欺骗图像。大多数现有的欺骗攻击检测方法都利用深度学习，这需要大量的训练数据。因此，如果将恶意数据注入到部分训练数据集中，则特定的欺骗攻击可能会被错误地分类为真实，从而导致误报。

Method: 通过将从欺骗攻击的面部图像中提取的特征嵌入到真实的脸部图像中，而不会引起任何可察觉的视觉变化，该方法使某些欺骗攻击能够绕过检测。

Result: 在公共数据集上进行的实验表明，所提出的方法对现有的欺骗攻击检测系统构成了现实的威胁。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的后门中毒攻击方法，以展示人脸反欺骗检测中后门中毒的潜在威胁。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net: A time series change detection network that infers change area from change moment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning approaches change area detection and change moment identification as distinct tasks, but change area can be inferred from change moment.

Method: CAIM-Net comprises three key steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction, and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. It uses a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking and boundary enhancement convolution. It determines coarse change moments using spatiotemporal correlation analysis and refines them using a multiscale temporal Class Activation Mapping (CAM) module. Finally, it infers change area from the weighted change moment.

Result: N/A

Conclusion: Pixels with the change moment must have undergone a change, so weighted change moment can infer change area.

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

TL;DR: 多模态大型语言模型中的幻觉是由文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差引起的。本文提出了一种基于梯度自反思的方法来估计各个token类型的影响，并将其整合到一个有影响力的对比解码框架中，以同时缓解这两种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型中的幻觉是由文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差引起的。现有的缓解方法启发式地解决了这些偏差，但没有理解跨实例的波动偏差水平。

Method: 提出了一种基于梯度自反思的方法来估计各个token类型（视觉、提示和先前的输出）的影响。然后，将估计的token影响整合到一个有影响力的对比解码框架中，以同时缓解这两种偏差。

Result: 大量的实验表明，该方法能有效地减少幻觉，在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法不需要额外的资源，如昂贵的微调、额外的模型或数据统计。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

*Miao Xu,Xiangyu Zhu,Xusheng Liang,Zidu Wang,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于重力场扩散桥（GravityDB）的方法，用于模拟手与物体之间的交互，生成更逼真、无穿透且稳定的抓取效果，并能捕捉到真实的手部变形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手部或手-物体姿态估计方法在生成粗略的交互状态时，由于手和物体复杂的几何形状，容易出现穿透或在接触区域留下明显间隙，并且真实人手在交互过程中会发生不可忽略的变形，之前的研究方法难以捕捉和表示这些变形。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为一种吸引驱动的过程，并提出GravityDB来模拟可变形的手部表面和刚性物体之间的交互。该方法通过文本描述中的语义信息来引导重力场的构建，从而实现更有意义的交互区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行了广泛的定性和定量实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决手-物体交互中存在的穿透、不稳定以及手部变形难以捕捉等问题，生成物理上合理的交互，确保稳定的抓取，并捕捉到真实的手部变形。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉结构变化和时间间隔之间的关系、缺乏临床实用性以及忽略 3D 解剖学背景方面存在局限性。

Method: 利用预训练的脑年龄估计器 (BAE) 来指导扩散模型生成 MRI，并提出 Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR) 以提高时间感知能力。

Result: 在 OASIS-3 数据集上训练和评估 TADM-3D，并在 NACC 数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D 模型能够准确预测 MRI 脑部进展。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的损失函数，负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失，以帮助保持分割结果的连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级别的准确性更重要。信号丢失容易导致不连续性。

Method: 将提出的损失函数应用于卷积神经网络，并讨论了实验设计的特点，例如降采样和间距校正。

Result: 与标准CNN和现有的拓扑感知损失相比，该方法减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在缺少输入信号的区域，从而提高了下游应用中实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 结构先验嵌入在损失函数设计中可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Count2Density的新流程，该流程仅使用计数级别的注释来预测有意义的密度图，其中包含定量空间信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人群密度估计依赖于细粒度的位置级别注释来训练深度网络，但是收集这种详细的注释既繁琐又耗时，并且对实际应用的可扩展性构成了重大障碍。

Method: Count2Density生成伪密度图，利用存储在历史地图库中的过去预测，从而减少了确认偏差。该库使用无监督的显着性估计器进行初始化，以提供初始空间先验，并通过预测密度图的EMA进行迭代更新。通过使用超几何分布从估计的拥挤区域中采样位置来获得这些伪密度图，采样数量由计数级别的注释确定。为了进一步增强模型的空间感知能力，我们添加了一个自监督的对比空间正则化器，以鼓励拥挤区域内相似的特征表示，同时最大程度地减少与背景区域的差异。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法显着优于跨域自适应方法，并且在多个数据集中，比最近的半监督环境中的最新方法获得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 其他分析验证了我们流程中每个单独组件的有效性，从而确认了Count2Density能够有效地从计数级别的注释中检索空间信息并实现准确的子区域计数。

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Motivation: 在军事领域，人工智能系统面临着日益严重的投毒攻击威胁，而针对目标检测系统的投毒攻击研究还很有限。

Method: 1. 构建了一个小型军事车辆数据集MilCivVeh。2. 实现了BadDet攻击的修改版本，探索了军事目标检测器对投毒攻击的脆弱性。3. 测试了专门的投毒检测方法和视觉工业检测领域的异常检测方法。4. 提出了AutoDetect，一种基于自编码器的补丁检测方法。

Result: 发现投毒攻击可以实现一定的攻击成功率，但需要投毒相当一部分数据。AutoDetect方法在区分干净样本和中毒样本方面表现出 promising 的结果，优于现有方法，同时时间和内存密集度更低。

Conclusion: 现有的检测方法还不够完善，需要更大的、具有代表性的数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击的风险和补丁检测的机会。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的去噪方法在低剂量CT图像中无法很好地平衡噪声抑制和图像质量保持。

Method: 使用基于Encoder-Decoder结构的强化学习方法，利用PPO算法实时优化去噪策略，并通过自定义的gym环境进行训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法在PSNR、SSIM和RMSE等指标上优于传统方法和其他深度学习方法。在COVID-19 LDCT数据集上的分类任务中，该方法将分类精度提高到94%。

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全、更准确的LDCT成像提供了一种有希望的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在自然语言理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但它们仅限于单模态文本处理，缺乏从非语言信号中解释情感线索的能力，阻碍了更具沉浸感和共情能力的人机交互。

Method: 该研究提出了一种多模态情感感知网络 (MSPN)，该网络使用跨模态融合 Transformer 和监督对比学习来提供情感线索。此外，还开发了一种情感感知提示工程策略，用于生成共情响应，并集成了文本到语音 (TTS) 系统和动画化身模块以实现富有表现力的交互。

Conclusion: 通过整合多模态情感感知到大型语言模型中，可以创建情感感知代理，从而增强人机交互的沉浸感和共情能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的fMRI分析方法存在信噪比低、个体差异大以及频率感知能力有限等问题，并且缺乏文本注释来提供上下文信息。

Method: RTGMFF框架包括三个部分：ROI驱动的fMRI文本生成、混合频率-空间编码器和自适应语义对齐模块。

Result: 在ADHD-200和ABIDE基准测试中，RTGMFF在诊断准确性方面超过了当前的方法。

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过结合文本生成和多模态特征融合，显著提高了脑部疾病诊断的性能。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can
indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling

automated, non-destructive approach to organoid segmentation and tracking. We
introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in
accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,
and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and
upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and
robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

Conclusion: PointAD+能够有效地检测和分割3D异常，并且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索可验证奖励的强化学习在参数小于 70 亿的轻量级 MLLMs 中的有效性。

Method: 通过长链思维数据进行监督微调（SFT），然后进行强化学习阶段。

Result: 使用长链思维数据的监督微调（SFT）显著提高了 MLLM 的推理能力，并且在 SFT 阶段之后，MLLMs 可以通过后续的 RL 阶段获得额外的性能提升。

Conclusion: 使用长链思维数据的 SFT 阶段是开发轻量级 MLLMs 推理能力的关键前提。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于自动检测组织学图像中星形胶质细胞的混合 CNN Transformer 检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多神经系统疾病的标志是星形胶质细胞的形态和密度发生改变。然而，它们复杂的分支和染色依赖性变异使得自动检测组织学图像成为一项极具挑战性的任务。

Method: 该模型结合了局部特征提取和全局上下文推理。热图引导的查询机制为小的和微弱的星形胶质细胞生成空间锚点，而轻量级 Transformer 模块提高了密集集群中的辨别能力。

Result: 在 ALDH1L1 和 GFAP 染色的星形胶质细胞数据集上进行评估，该模型始终优于 Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11 和 DETR，通过 FROC 分析证实，该模型实现了更高的灵敏度，同时减少了误报。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了混合 CNN Transformer 架构在鲁棒星形胶质细胞检测方面的潜力，并为先进的计算病理学工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

*Yixiong Jing,Cheng Zhang,Haibing Wu,Guangming Wang,Olaf Wysocki,Brian Sheil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion: a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM) to enhance visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps for brick-level segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation has been primarily conducted from RGB images, but acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation.

Method: InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM).

Result: Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion has potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的transformer引导的内容自适应图解混框架(T-CAGU)，以解决高光谱解混问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时描述全局依赖关系和局部一致性，难以同时保持长程交互和边界细节。

Method: 利用transformer捕获全局依赖关系，并引入内容自适应图神经网络来增强局部关系。集成了多个传播顺序以动态学习图结构，并利用图残差机制来保持全局信息并稳定训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效解决了高光谱解混问题，并在实验中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

TL;DR: 提出 TinyDrop 框架，用于在不影响准确性的前提下减少大型 ViT 模型的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型 ViT 模型处理所有图像 tokens 导致计算成本高昂。

Method: 利用轻量级视觉模型引导的、无需训练的 token dropping 框架 TinyDrop。该框架通过估计 tokens 的重要性，有选择地丢弃低重要性的 tokens。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该框架可以将 ViT 模型的 FLOPs 降低高达 80%，且精度下降极小。

Conclusion: TinyDrop 框架具有良好的泛化能力和实用性，可有效提升基于 ViT 的分类效率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估概念定制的方法，该方法将评估标准分解为更精细的方面，并使用多模态大型语言模型进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估概念定制具有挑战性，因为它需要对生成提示和概念图像的保真度进行综合评估。此外，评估多个概念比评估单个概念困难得多，因为它不仅需要对每个单独的概念进行详细评估，还需要对概念之间的交互进行评估。

Method: 我们提出了分解GPT评分（D-GPTScore），这是一种新的人类对齐评估方法，该方法将评估标准分解为更精细的方面，并结合使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）进行方面评估。

Result: 我们的方法在这个基准测试中明显优于现有方法，与人类偏好表现出更高的相关性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估概念定制建立了一个新的标准，并强调了未来研究的关键挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，用于整合来自各种模态的数据，以增强乳腺癌亚型分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态整合可以极大地帮助医疗应用，但临床环境中可用的模态可能因地点和患者而异。乳腺癌分子亚型分析可以促进个性化治疗并改善患者预后，因此可以从多模态整合中获益。

Method: 提出了一种双重表示方法用于全切片图像（WSI），结合了传统的基于图像和基于图的WSI表示。此外，还提出了一种新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 将双重WSI表示与CNV和临床健康记录相结合，以及我们的流程和融合策略，优于乳腺癌亚型分析中的最新方法。

Conclusion: 该框架可以轻松适应其他模态，并且可以扩展或缩小，而无需重新训练现有模态，因此也适用于其他类型的癌症。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的密集视频字幕方法，该方法可以有效地处理长视频，并且可以进行在线处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集视频字幕方法在处理长视频时，由于计算复杂度和内存限制，往往会遇到困难。此外，传统方法需要将整个视频作为输入才能生成字幕，这排除了对视频进行在线处理的可能性。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSM）的时间缩放方法，该方法结合了SSM的长序列和循环特性，并解决了SSM无法长时间维持其状态的主要限制，从而有效地扩展了SSM的时间范围。

Result: 本文提出的方法在密集视频字幕任务中表现良好，并且可以使用更少的FLOP。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法可以有效地处理长视频，并且可以进行在线处理，这在实践中更有利。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 旨在从低信噪比脑电图信号中解码视觉神经表征

Method: 1. 引入文本模态以增强脑电图信号和视觉内容之间的语义对应关系; 2. 提出了一个适配器模块，以减轻高维表征的不稳定性，同时促进跨模态特征的对齐和融合; 3. 提出了一种模态一致性动态平衡（MCDB）策略，该策略动态调整每个模态的贡献权重; 4. 提出了一种随机扰动正则化（SPR）项，通过在模态优化过程中引入动态高斯噪声来增强基于语义扰动的模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上的评估结果表明，该方法在Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上均超过了先前的state-of-the-art方法，分别提高了2.0％和4.7％。

Conclusion: 该方法在ThingsEEG数据集上的评估结果表明，该方法在Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上均超过了先前的state-of-the-art方法，分别提高了2.0％和4.7％。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

*Kuan-Chuan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 JTGD 的道路缺陷检测方法，该方法在边缘设备上部署时更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路缺陷检测对于减少车辆损伤非常重要。考虑到缺陷检测器通常部署在内存和计算资源有限的边缘设备上，因此需要在不使用集成方法或测试时增强 (TTA) 的情况下执行道路缺陷检测。

Method: 联合训练图像生成器和检测器 (JTGD)。设计了用于生成模型的双重判别器，以强制合成的缺陷补丁和整体图像看起来都是合理的。通过提出的基于 CLIP 的 Fr'echet Inception Distance 损失来提高合成图像质量。生成模型与检测器联合训练，以鼓励生成模型为检测器合成更难的例子。

Result: 在 RDD2022 道路缺陷检测基准测试中，在没有集成和 TTA 的条件下，JTGD 优于最先进的方法。JTGD 仅使用不到 20% 的参数量，与竞争基线相比，这使其更适合在实践中部署在边缘设备上。

Conclusion: JTGD 是一种有效的道路缺陷检测方法，它在精度和效率之间取得了良好的平衡，使其成为边缘设备部署的理想选择。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）任务中，充分微调多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）成本高昂。

Method: 通过添加将视觉提示与图像相结合，并通过带有文本查询“对图像的技术质量进行评分”的mPLUG-Owl2进行处理，仅训练600K参数（<0.01%的基础模型）。

Result: 在KADID-10k上实现了0.93 SRCC，在KADID-10k、KonIQ-10k和AGIQA-3k上，针对失真类型（合成的、真实的、AI生成的）的评估表明，该方法具有与完全微调方法和专门的NR-IQA模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 这是第一个利用像素空间视觉提示进行NR-IQA的工作，从而实现了MLLM的有效适应低级视觉任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Motivation: To create a unified multimodal model that is efficient and eliminates the need for external vision components during inference, especially for high-resolution inputs.

Method: A modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective and a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM).

Result: OneCAT outperforms existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

Conclusion: Pure autoregressive modeling is a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Motivation: 在机器学习模型开发中，对多目标跟踪和目标检测模型性能进行基准测试至关重要，它可以评估模型在人工生成的“测试”数据上的检测和跟踪器性能，促进模型和跟踪器之间的一致比较，并有助于性能优化。

Method: 开发了一个新的基准视频数据集，并用于评估多个 Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 目标检测模型和一个 FathomNet 单类目标检测模型以及多个跟踪器的性能。该数据集包含代表中水层和底栖深海栖息地的四个视频序列。使用高阶跟踪精度（一种平衡检测、定位和关联精度的指标）评估性能。

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

TL;DR: Strefer: A synthetic data generation framework that enhances Video LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning, especially with time-based event references or gestural cues.

Method: Strefer uses a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner.

Result: Models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation and exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: Strefer establishes a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了 T2I-CoReBench，一个综合且复杂的基准，用于评估 Text-to-Image (T2I) 模型在组合和推理能力上的表现。该基准旨在解决现有基准在全面性和复杂性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 T2I 基准在全面评估组合和推理能力方面存在明显的局限性，并且无法处理复杂场景和多步骤推理。

Method: 论文构建了一个12维的评估分类体系，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性和关系）构建组合，并围绕推理的哲学框架（演绎、归纳和溯因）构建推理。每个prompt都配有一个检查表，用于评估每个预期元素。

Result: 在对 27 个 T2I 模型进行的实验表明，这些模型在复杂的高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，而推理能力则更加落后。

Conclusion: T2I 模型的组合能力在复杂场景中仍然有限，而推理能力是关键瓶颈，所有模型都难以从提示中推断出隐含的元素。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

TL;DR: 探讨了媒体在促使AI开发者生产安全产品方面的潜力，从而实现AI技术的广泛应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI产品的开发者在利润和用户安全之间进行选择时，可能更倾向于利润。不可信的AI技术必须伴随着切实的负面后果。

Method: 通过演化博弈论，创建了自私的创造者和用户的人工群体，并对他们进行了研究。

Result: 媒体确实能够促进创造者和用户之间的合作，但并非总是如此。如果媒体提供的信息质量不够可靠，或者访问媒体或确保安全的成本太高，合作就不会发展。

Conclusion: 通过塑造公众认知和让开发者承担责任，即使在缺乏正式政府监督的情况下，媒体也能成为一个强大的软监管机构，引导人工智能安全。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS),
which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains

summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational

TL;DR: Vision Language World Model (VLWM) is introduced for language-based world modeling on natural videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level world models that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal abstraction remain largely underdeveloped.

Method: VLWM infers goal achievements and predicts trajectories of actions and world state changes using iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations. It learns an action policy and a dynamics model.

Result: VLWM achieves state-of-the-art Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance and outperforms strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Conclusion: VLWM demonstrates effective planning through reactive system-1 and reflective system-2 planning.

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Motivation: 现有的语义操作符执行效率低，Deep Research系统缺乏查询计划优化。

Method: 构建了一个原型，使Deep Research agents能够编写和执行优化的语义操作符程序。

Result: 该原型在两个基本查询上优于手工语义操作符程序和开放Deep Research系统，F1-score提高了1.95倍。即使代理可以使用语义操作符作为工具，该原型仍然可以节省高达76.8%的成本和72.7%的运行时间。

Conclusion: 该原型验证了结合优化语义操作符执行和Deep Research系统灵活性的AI驱动分析运行时的有效性。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自动驾驶运动生成中应用前景广阔，但对于哪些LLM模块真正可迁移仍然缺乏系统的理解。

Method: 通过在Waymo Sim Agents基准上进行大量实验，评估了分词器设计、位置嵌入、预训练范式、后训练策略和测试时计算五个关键LLM模块。

Result: 结果表明，适当调整后，这些模块可以显著提高自动驾驶运动生成的性能。确定了可以有效转移的技术，并分析了其他技术失败的潜在原因。

Conclusion: 在Sim Agents任务上评估了该方法，并取得了有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Motivation: 具身智能中，基于 LLM 的任务计划和人类演示可能存在噪声，导致策略质量下降。

Method: 使用自然语言提示，Judge LLM 评估动作序列，Planner LLM 进行修改。

Result: 该框架在 TEACh 数据集上实现了高达 90% 的召回率和 100% 的精确率，且能快速收敛，同时提高了时间和空间效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建立可靠的 LLM 空间规划和动作改进能力，为具身智能的模仿学习提供高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Motivation: 现有的选择超启发式方法主要集中于从预定义集合中自适应选择低级启发式算法（LLH）。

Method: 系统地分析了基于三个关键原则的转换：解决方案接受、LLH重复和扰动强度。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的现实世界领域中，该方法优于所有现有的最先进的超启发式方法，并找到了 11 个新的已知最佳解决方案。在 CHeSC 基准测试中，该方法与 CHeSC 竞赛的获胜者不相上下。通过使用这种方法，在 CHeSC 基准测试和现实世界领域中，优于当前最先进的方法，同时通常简化了它们的设计。

Conclusion: 通过对低级启发式算法集合进行策略性转换，即使是简单的随机选择机制也能取得优异的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Motivation: 组合方法在学习解决大型规划问题集合的通用策略方面得到了发展。相对于深度学习方法，其优势在于结果策略可以被理解和证明是正确的。一个弱点是这些方法不能 масштабироваться，只能从小训练实例和最多包含几百个状态和特征的特征池中学习。

Result: 分析了该方法的 формальные 属性，并在一些基准上测试了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的符号方法，可以有效地处理具有数百万个状态的问题和具有数十万个特征的池。

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Motivation: 在需要学习长序列动作的领域中，自适应探索方法需要在探索和利用之间进行切换，而确定合适的切换时机至关重要。

Method: 该框架采用不确定性来解决切换时机的问题，并且可以结合各种不确定性测量机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架产生的自适应探索策略在多个MuJoCo环境中优于标准策略。

Conclusion: 本文提出的自适应探索框架能够有效地解决探索和利用之间的切换时机问题，并在实验中取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Method: 通过广泛的分析，我们分析了问责制的概念，制定了问责制框架，并提供了用于处理各种问责制机制的三层结构。

Result: 我们提出的问责制框架将医疗人工智能系统的法规和参与者采用的机制置于一致的问责制制度之下。此外，三层结构指导医疗人工智能系统的参与者根据其行为对机制进行分类。

Conclusion: 我们提倡医疗人工智能的决策应具有共同的依赖性，问责制应共同处理，并应促进合作。我们强调了可解释性在促进参与者之间的沟通和信息共享以进一步促进协作过程中的作用。

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Motivation: 目前的工作主要集中在演绎推理上，而其他类型的推理在解决现实世界的问题中也至关重要，但却很少被探索。

Method: 我们引入了一个可编程的合成数据集InAbHyD，其中每个推理示例都包含一个不完整的世界模型和一组观察结果。智能体的任务是产生假设，以解释不完整世界模型下的观察结果，从而解决每个推理示例。我们提出了一个新的指标，用于评估基于奥卡姆剃刀的假设质量。

Result: 我们的分析表明，LLM可以在简单的场景中执行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂的世​​界模型和产生高质量的假设方面存在困难，即使使用流行的推理增强技术（如上下文学习和RLVR）也是如此。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在简单的场景中可以进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂场景下表现不佳。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control

compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地研究了具身人工智能系统中的对抗性安全攻击，基于人机交互的ISO标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身人工智能系统引入了关键的安全风险：受损的VLA模型可以直接将感官输入上的对抗性扰动转化为不安全的物理动作。传统的安全定义和方法不再足够。

Method: 1) 基于物理约束（如分离距离、速度和碰撞边界）形式化了安全违规行为的分类（严重、危险、有风险）；2) 引入了ANNIEBench，一个包含九个安全关键场景和2400个视频-动作序列的基准，用于评估具身安全性；3) ANNIE-Attack，一个任务感知的对抗性框架，带有一个攻击引导模型，可以将长时程目标分解为帧级别的扰动。

Result: 在代表性的EAI模型上的评估显示，所有安全类别中的攻击成功率超过50%。通过物理机器人实验验证了真实世界的影响。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了具身人工智能系统中一个以前未被充分探索但影响重大的攻击面，强调了物理人工智能时代对安全驱动防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

TL;DR: SAM-LLM: A hybrid model combining LLMs with kinematic lane change models for interpretable autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between LLM reasoning and kinematic model precision in autonomous driving, and to improve interpretability of lane change trajectory prediction.

Method: Finetuning an LLM to output physical parameters for a Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM) instead of raw coordinates.

Result: Achieved 98.73% intention prediction accuracy with an 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods.

Conclusion: SAM-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved explainability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

*Fangzhou Wu,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种免训练的在线LLM路由算法，以解决现有方法难以适应高查询量和有限token预算的在线场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）服务的需求不断增长，给供应商带来了巨大的部署和计算成本。LLM路由通过根据模型和查询特征将查询定向到最佳LLM，提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 该算法利用近似最近邻搜索来有效估计查询特征，并对一小组初始查询执行一次性优化，以学习指导未来路由的路由策略。

Result: 该算法在3个基准数据集和8个基线测试中进行了广泛的实验验证，结果表明，总体性能平均提高了3.55倍，成本效率提高了1.85倍，吞吐量提高了近4.25倍。

Conclusion: 该算法在自然假设下实现了1-o(1)的竞争比。

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model
and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline
scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: BARGAIN是一种通过使用低成本LLM来降低数据处理成本的方法，同时保证解决方案的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在使用LLM处理大型文本数据集时，需要在成本和质量之间进行权衡。顶级LLM虽然准确率高，但成本也很高。低成本LLM虽然成本低，但准确率也较低。模型级联框架可以管理这种权衡，但现有解决方案的成本节省有限，理论保证也很弱。

Method: BARGAIN采用了一种新颖的自适应抽样策略和统计估计程序，该程序利用数据和任务特征，并基于最新的统计工具进行精确估计，并具有严格的理论保证。

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，BARGAIN的成本平均降低了86%，同时提供了更强的输出准确性理论保证，在保证期望的精确率或召回率水平时也有类似的收益。

Conclusion: BARGAIN可以通过使用低成本LLM来显著降低数据处理成本，同时提供强大的解决方案质量理论保证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block
in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers
offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality
trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when
processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality
LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we
need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from
that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a
blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their
output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the
affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide
only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor
estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,
a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to
significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the
solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and
statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and
builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight
theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,
precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world
datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than
state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy
of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or
recall.

*Wenrui Zhou,Qiyu Liu,Jingshu Peng,Aoqian Zhang,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CARPO is a new learned query optimizer that uses listwise learning-to-rank with a Transformer model and a hybrid decision mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional query optimizers are often suboptimal due to flawed heuristics and inaccurate cost models.

Method: A Transformer-based model is used for holistic evaluation of candidate plan sets. A hybrid decision mechanism, featuring Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection with a top-$k$ fallback strategy is integrated to ensure reliability.

Result: CARPO significantly outperforms both native PostgreSQL and Lero on TPC-H and STATS benchmarks.

Conclusion: CARPO is a strong learned query optimizer that outperforms traditional methods.

Abstract: Efficient data processing is increasingly vital, with query optimizers
playing a fundamental role in translating SQL queries into optimal execution
plans. Traditional cost-based optimizers, however, often generate suboptimal
plans due to flawed heuristics and inaccurate cost models, leading to the
emergence of Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs). To address challenges in existing
LQOs, such as the inconsistency and suboptimality inherent in pairwise ranking
methods, we introduce CARPO, a generic framework leveraging listwise
learning-to-rank for context-aware query plan optimization. CARPO distinctively
employs a Transformer-based model for holistic evaluation of candidate plan
sets and integrates a robust hybrid decision mechanism, featuring
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection with a top-$k$ fallback strategy to ensure
reliability. Furthermore, CARPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing plan
embedding techniques, demonstrating strong adaptability. Comprehensive
experiments on TPC-H and STATS benchmarks demonstrate that CARPO significantly
outperforms both native PostgreSQL and Lero, achieving a Top-1 Rate of
\textbf{74.54\%} on the TPC-H benchmark compared to Lero's 3.63\%, and reducing
the total execution time to 3719.16 ms compared to PostgreSQL's 22577.87 ms.

*Chenxia Tang,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应的KV-cache压缩方案GVote，无需手动指定预算即可实现卓越的精度-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV-cache压缩方法存在问题：它们将不同的工作负载强制采用固定的压缩率，导致次优的资源分配和推理性能。

Method: 该方法通过蒙特卡洛式采样潜在查询并聚合选定的键来预测未来查询的注意力需求，从而确定最佳缓存预算。

Result: 实验评估表明，GVote在多个基准测试中有效，与基线相比，GVote表现出2倍的内存减少，同时精度保持较高或相当。

Conclusion: GVote是一种有效的自适应KV-cache压缩方案，可以在不牺牲精度的情况下显著减少内存占用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to
accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows
rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current
KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force
diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource
allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an
adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget
specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote
operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys
required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands
by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys
to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple
benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote
exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or
comparable.

*Huiling Li,Jianliang Xu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图结构，名为 Block-aware Monotonic Relative Neighborhood Graph (BMRNG)，用于解决基于磁盘的近似最近邻搜索 (ANNS) 中的 I/O 瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于磁盘的 ANNS 图索引解决方案通常要么优化给定图的存储布局，要么独立于存储布局构建图，忽略了它们之间的相互作用。这篇论文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该论文提出了 BMRNG，它联合考虑几何距离和存储布局进行边缘选择，并从理论上保证了 I/O 单调搜索路径的存在。为了解决 BMRNG 构建的可扩展性挑战，该论文进一步开发了一种实用且高效的变体，即 Block-Aware Monotonic Graph (BAMG)，它可以从单调图中线性构建，同时考虑存储布局。BAMG 集成了块感知边缘修剪和解耦存储设计，最大限度地提高了块利用率，并最大限度地减少了冗余磁盘读取。此外，该论文还设计了一个多层导航图，用于自适应和高效的查询条目，以及一个块优先搜索算法，该算法优先考虑块内遍历，以充分利用每个磁盘 I/O 操作。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，与最先进的方法相比，BAMG 实现了高达 2.1 倍的吞吐量，并将 I/O 读取减少了高达 52%，同时保持了相当的召回率。

Conclusion: BAMG 是一种有效的图索引结构，可以显著提高基于磁盘的 ANNS 的性能。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors is a
foundational problem in databases, where disk I/O often emerges as the dominant
performance bottleneck at scale. Existing graph indexing solutions for
disk-based ANNS typically either optimize the storage layout for a given graph
or construct the graph independently of the storage layout, thus overlooking
their interaction. In this paper, we propose the Block-aware Monotonic Relative
Neighborhood Graph (BMRNG), a novel graph structure that jointly considers both
geometric distance and storage layout for edge selection, theoretically
guaranteeing the existence of I/O monotonic search paths. To address the
scalability challenge of BMRNG construction, we further develop a practical and
efficient variant, the Block-Aware Monotonic Graph (BAMG), which can be
constructed in linear time from a monotonic graph considering the storage
layout. BAMG integrates block-aware edge pruning with a decoupled storage
design that separates raw vectors from the graph index, thereby maximizing
block utilization and minimizing redundant disk reads. Additionally, we design
a multi-layer navigation graph for adaptive and efficient query entry, along
with a block-first search algorithm that prioritizes intra-block traversal to
fully exploit each disk I/O operation. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BAMG achieves up to 2.1x higher throughput and
reduces I/O reads by up to 52% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while
maintaining comparable recall.

TL;DR: NeurStore是一个新型的数据库内模型管理系统，旨在提高深度学习模型的存储和利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据库系统在存储深度学习模型时效率低下，无法满足日益增长的需求。

Method: NeurStore采用了一种基于张量的模型存储引擎，并提出了delta量化算法和压缩感知模型加载机制。

Result: NeurStore实现了比现有方法更高的压缩率和具有竞争力的模型加载吞吐量。

Conclusion: NeurStore能够有效地存储和利用深度学习模型。

Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an
increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding
number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems
typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression
techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning
models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents
NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient
storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a
tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within
databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world
(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors
within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.
Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses
delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable
model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading
mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct
computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading
throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的检索增强生成（RAG）方法，该方法结合了来自标记和未标记数据的证据，并通过标准化检索分数来有效地融合这些异构来源的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地结合来自标记和未标记数据的证据具有挑战性，因为它们各自的相似度分数不具有可比性。此外，如何整合来自多个排序器的输出以提高RAG的有效性也是一个问题。

Method: 该方法首先使用标准排序融合技术聚合来自多个信息检索（IR）模型的顶部文档，然后通过应用z-score转换来标准化每个来源内的检索分数分布，最后合并来自两个来源的顶部检索文档。

Result: 在事实核查任务上的评估表明，该方法始终优于最佳的单个排序器或来源，并且表现出更好的领域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的RAG方法，它能够更好地利用标记和未标记数据，并在事实核查任务中取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating

user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements

Abstract: In the contemporary age characterized by information abundance, rapid

Motivation: 为了提高推荐系统嵌入的语义和可解释性，现有方法通常添加额外信息，但未系统考虑代表性和价值，导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出RVRec，一种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，使用基于负2-Wasserstein距离的对比损失来学习增强嵌入的代表性，并引入基于多元Shapley值的重加权方法来评估交互和嵌入的价值。

Result: 在多个骨干推荐器和真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，RVRec可以提高现有推荐器的个性化和可解释性，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: RVRec能够有效提升推荐系统的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing multimedia recommender systems provide users with suggestions of
media by evaluating the similarities, such as games and movies. To enhance the
semantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply
additional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,
without systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility
and explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a
plug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve
both personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we
propose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a
contrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance
the representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing
method based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore
the value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple
backbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the
personalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RecBase 在跨领域推荐任务中表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

Method: 通过两阶段过程建模单调性：合成反事实样本和对比反事实样本。这两种技术自然地集成到一个与模型无关的框架中，形成端到端训练过程。

Result: 在公开数据集和真实的工业数据集上进行了大量的经验测试，结果充分证明了我们提出的 CCSS 的有效性。

Conclusion: CCSS 已部署在我们真实的、大规模的工业推荐系统中，成功地为数亿用户提供服务。

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real
large-scale industrial recommender, successfully serving over hundreds of
millions users.

TL;DR: OneSearch is an end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search that addresses limitations of multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional e-commerce search systems with multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, limiting their performance.

Method: The OneSearch framework incorporates: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS).

Result: Offline evaluations and online A/B tests demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance, achieving significant improvements in item CTR (+1.67%), buyer rate (+2.40%), and order volume (+3.22%). It also reduces operational expenditure by 75.40% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26% to 27.32%.

Conclusion: OneSearch has been successfully deployed in Kuaishou, serving millions of users and generating tens of millions of PVs daily.

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading
architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational
efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented
computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which
ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose
\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative
framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key
innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)
module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes
while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view
user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user
IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences
to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward
System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive
reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's
superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online
A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure
position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR,
+2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces
operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from
3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple
search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of
millions of PVs daily.

### [115] [The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)
*Zichuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种通过长期停用神经元进行更强正则化的方法，但恢复神经元时存在训练不稳定性问题。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了生命周期（LC）原则，通过状态记忆来恢复神经元的参数到其最后已知的有效状态，避免了破坏性的优化冲击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决像Dropout这样的方法中临时变化的问题，并探索更强的正则化形式。

Method: 提出生命周期（LC）原则，其核心创新是状态记忆。该方法在神经元恢复时，不是重新初始化，而是将其参数恢复到最后已知的有效状态。

Result: 在图像分类基准上的实验表明，该方法提高了泛化能力和鲁棒性。消融研究证实，状态记忆对于实现这些增益至关重要。

Conclusion: 状态记忆能够平滑损失 landscape，引导优化到与更好泛化相关的更平坦的最小值。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于期望最大化（EM）的潜变量建模方法，用于多智能体强化学习（MARL），以协调无人机（UAV）在野生动物保护中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在广阔且部分可观察的环境中，保护濒危野生动物免受非法偷猎是一项严峻的挑战，尤其是在需要实时响应的情况下。

Method: 通过潜变量对隐藏的环境因素和智能体间的动态进行建模，增强了不确定性下的探索和协调。

Result: 与近端策略优化（PPO）和深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）等标准算法相比，实验结果表明该方法在检测精度、适应性和策略收敛方面表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: 将EM推理与MARL相结合，有可能改善复杂、高风险保护场景中的分散决策。

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的处理类别不平衡问题的方法，即分组感知阈值校准，该方法为不同的群体设置不同的决策阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的类别不平衡解决方案通常会产生与解决的问题一样多的问题。本文旨在寻找更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 该方法通过为不同的群体设置不同的决策阈值来实现。

Result: 分组感知阈值校准比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型实现了更高的平衡精度，同时提高了最差组的平衡精度。

Conclusion: 分组感知阈值校准是类别不平衡问题的一种更简单、更易于解释和更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DPO-PRO的微调算法，用于解决公共卫生领域中序列资源分配问题，该算法能更好地适应噪声偏好信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用人类自然语言偏好设计奖励函数，解决公共卫生领域中序列资源分配问题，但该问题具有复杂、模糊的目标和有限的数据可用性，对对齐提出了挑战。

Method: 提出DPO-PRO算法，该算法基于直接偏好优化(DPO)，并使用轻量级的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)公式来解决偏好分布中的不确定性。

Result: 在真实世界的妇幼健康项目和标准对齐基准上的实验结果表明，DPO-PRO算法在噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性方面优于现有的DPO变体，并且在奖励函数设计方面与之前的自反思基线相当，但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO算法在复杂和不确定性环境下，能够有效地利用人类偏好来设计奖励函数，并在实际应用中具有优势。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动作崩溃策略梯度(ACPG)的方法，该方法通过在动作选择层中使用固定的等角紧框架(ETF)结构来学习最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究策略梯度方法中使用深度神经网络学习共享特征表示时，底层网络的表征结构。

Method: 分析最优策略DNN训练过程中出现的动作崩溃(AC)现象，并提出ACPG方法，该方法在动作选择层固定一个合成的ETF。

Result: 实验表明，ACPG可以集成到任何离散PG方法中，并能更快、更稳健地提高奖励。

Conclusion: 在动作选择层使用固定的ETF结构可以学习最优策略，ACPG能够引导策略DNN在动作选择层产生理想的配置，同时保持最优性。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

*Saarang Panchavati,Corey Arnold,William Speier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了基于 Mamba 的选择性状态空间模型在增强神经系统疾病诊断中脑电图 (EEG) 分析的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图对于诊断癫痫等疾病至关重要，但由于其噪声大、高维和非线性特性，因此存在重大挑战。传统机器学习方法在自动化脑电图分析方面取得了一些进展，但通常无法捕捉其复杂的时空动态。

Method: 通过在包含癫痫和非癫痫脑电图记录的大型数据集上训练基于 Mamba 的模型，通过自监督重建任务，然后是癫痫检测任务，我们证明了该模型的有效性。

Result: 在保留的测试集上实现了 0.72 的 AUROC。

Conclusion: 这种方法标志着朝着开发用于脑电图数据分析的大规模、临床适用的基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Sandeep Madireddy,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LExI的数据无关优化技术，用于确定预训练MoE模型中每层激活专家的最佳数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的MoE模型优化方法在推理时计算效率提升有限，且通常在所有层中统一激活固定数量的专家，导致计算冗余和性能欠佳。

Method: LExI仅利用模型权重来估计每层的重要性，并自适应地分配每层激活专家的数量。

Result: 在最先进的语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI在推理效率方面显著优于传统的MoE剪枝方法，且精度损失可忽略不计。例如，使用LExI，Qwen1.5-MoE在Nvidia H100 GPU上实现了相同的吞吐量，但精度提高了10%。

Conclusion: LExI是一种有效的方法，可以在MoE模型中实现更高的推理效率，同时保持较高的精度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

TL;DR: 提出了Transparent Earth，一个基于Transformer的架构，用于从异构数据集中重建地下属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重建地下属性，解决数据稀疏性、分辨率和模态差异问题。

Method: 使用Transformer架构，结合位置编码和模态编码，模态编码由文本嵌入模型生成。

Result: 在验证数据上，预测应力角的误差减少了三倍以上，性能随参数增加而提高。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth是一个地球地下基础模型，旨在预测地球上任何位置的任何地下属性。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的预测不确定性的统一框架，它通过Bregman散度诱导的中心聚合将多假设预测和集成学习联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预测不确定性的方法要么依赖于多假设预测（促进多样性但缺乏有原则的聚合），要么依赖于集成学习（提高准确性但很少捕捉到结构化的模糊性）。

Method: 通过Bregman散度诱导的中心聚合将多假设预测和集成学习联系起来，提出的结构化基函数网络。

Result: 通过实验验证了这种关系，并使用该机制研究了深度学习预测器在日益困难的数据集上的复杂性-容量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将预测与损失的几何结构对齐，适用于回归和分类问题，并支持闭式最小二乘估计器和基于梯度的通用目标过程。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型(LLM)促进物理信息符号回归(PiSR)中的知识集成，从而减少人工干预并提高模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的物理信息符号回归(PiSR)方法通常需要专门的公式和手动特征工程，限制了其适应性，本研究旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 将LLM集成到SR的损失函数中，增加一个LLM对SR生成的方程的评估项。

Result: LLM的集成能够持续改进从数据中重建物理动力学的过程，增强了SR模型对噪声和复杂性的鲁棒性。更翔实的提示可以显著提高性能。

Conclusion: 利用预训练的LLM，可以自动整合领域知识到PiSR中，使得该过程对更广泛的科学问题变得更加容易。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 MPNN 难以捕捉全局和区域图结构，因为网络深度增加会导致过度平滑风险。图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量编码全局信息，预训练 GNN 来预测这些特征向量可以鼓励网络自然地学习每个图上的大规模结构模式。

Method: 通过归纳学习拉普拉斯特征向量来预训练 GNN。

Result: 在各种基于图结构的任务上，通过我们的框架预训练的模型优于基线模型。该自监督预训练框架是基于结构的并且高度灵活。特征向量学习可以应用于所有基于图的数据集，并且可以在任务特定数据稀疏时与合成特征一起使用。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的 GNN 预训练框架，该框架通过学习拉普拉斯特征向量来有效地捕获图结构，并在各种任务中优于基线模型。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

Result: 研究结果表明，模型中间层出现线性可解码的冲突信号，并且与冲突检测和解决相关的注意力模式在网络的不同阶段存在差异。

Conclusion: 冲突检测和解决是功能上不同的机制。这种分解能够实现更具可操作性的可解释性，并为在具有挑战性的多模态环境中提高模型鲁棒性的有针对性的干预提供支持。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为JensUn的LLM非学习方法，该方法利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，以实现更稳定和有效的非学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中的非学习涉及精确地从预训练模型中删除特定信息。这对于通过删除在预训练期间获取的私人数据或有害知识来确保LLM的安全性至关重要。

Method: 我们利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为遗忘和保留集的训练目标，与常用的损失函数相比，实现了更稳定和有效的非学习动态。

Result: 在广泛的实验中，JensUn实现了比竞争方法更好的遗忘-效用权衡，甚至表现出对良性再学习的强大弹性。此外，为了进行精确的非学习评估，我们引入了LKF，这是一个精选的鲜为人知的事实数据集，提供了真实的非学习场景。我们改进的评估框架表明，许多现有方法的效果不如以前认为的那么有效。

Conclusion: JensUn在遗忘-效用权衡方面优于现有技术，并且对良性再学习具有很强的弹性。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as

### [128] [Ensemble Learning for Healthcare: A Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Voting and Ensemble Stacking in Obesity Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02826)
*Towhidul Islam,Md Sumon Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early obesity risk prediction is important due to its association with chronic diseases, and machine learning offers a promising approach.

Method: The study compares Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer Perceptron as meta-classifier) using two datasets and nine ML algorithms.

Result: Weighted hard voting and stacking performed similarly well on Dataset-1, while stacking outperformed other methods on Dataset-2.

Conclusion: Ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive capability, especially for complex data, while hybrid majority voting is a robust alternative.

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的CPTC算法，用于解决时间序列中变化点的不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间序列不确定性量化方法难以处理具有变化点的数据。

Method: 该算法集成了预测底层状态的模型和在线共形预测，以模拟非平稳时间序列中的不确定性。

Result: 在6个合成和真实世界的数据集上验证了CPTC的有效性，表明其在有效性和适应性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 证明了 CPTC 在时间序列设置中的有效性和改进的适应性，且只需最小的假设

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于偏微分方程（PDEs）的测试时计算（TTC）策略，以提高预测精度并减少训练样本和模型大小的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏微分方程基础模型受限于预训练数据集，且自回归展开性能不佳，尤其是在分布外（OOD）情况下。此外，它们还需要大量的计算和训练数据。

Method: 引入了一种测试时计算（TTC）策略，该策略在推理过程中利用计算资源，通过两个奖励模型评估随机模型的时空一致性预测结果。

Result: 在 PDEGym 基准的可压缩 Euler 方程模拟中，TTC 相对于标准的非自适应自回归推理，能够获得改进的预测结果。

Conclusion: TTC 框架是朝着更高级的推理算法或 PDE 建模迈出的基础性一步，包括构建基于强化学习的方法，有可能改变物理和工程中的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的分布式强化学习框架，用于实时、可扩展的电网管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制系统难以适应和扩展，因此需要更动态和分布式的控制策略。

Method: 采用图神经网络(GNN)对网络拓扑信息进行编码，并结合模仿学习和基于势的奖励塑造来加速收敛和提高学习稳定性。该方法还分解了观察空间。

Result: 在Grid2Op模拟环境中的实验表明，该方法优于标准基线，并且比基于仿真的专家方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该模型在电网管理中是有效的，并且计算效率更高。

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据增强技术，名为量子启发式SMOTE（QI-SMOTE），利用量子原理来提升机器学习分类器的性能，尤其是在处理类别不平衡的医疗数据时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的一个关键挑战，特别是在医疗领域，它会导致模型偏差和预测性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据增强技术QI-SMOTE，它利用量子演化和分层纠缠等量子原理来生成合成实例，以保留复杂的数据结构。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上验证了QI-SMOTE，使用死亡率检测作为基准任务。结果表明，QI-SMOTE显著提高了集成方法、基于核的模型和深度学习方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将量子启发式转换集成到ML流程中，QI-SMOTE不仅缓解了类别不平衡，还提高了医疗诊断和决策中预测模型的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的合成数据生成框架，该框架能够生成更贴近真实世界观测数据的合成数据集，从而改进因果估计器的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法通常需要用户提供参数的点估计，无法表达参数值的不确定性，也无法进行后验推断，可能导致不可靠的估计器比较。

Method: 本文提出了基于模拟推理的因果评估（SBICE）框架，该框架将生成参数建模为不确定的，并根据源数据集推断其后验分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，SBICE通过生成更真实的数据集提高了估计器评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: SBICE为不确定性下的因果基准测试提供了一种稳健且数据一致的方法。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于检测大象足迹的分类框架，该框架针对资源受限的实现，并优先考虑准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发解决人象冲突 (HEC) 的方案。现有的解决方案严重依赖于人工分类大象的脚步声，这限制了它们在自然环境中进行实时分类的适用性。

Method: 引入了一种名为上下文定制窗口 (CCW) 的新事件检测技术，该技术专门用于检测大象的脚步声，并通过将其与短期平均/长期平均 (STA/LTA) 方法进行比较来进行评估。使用支持向量机 (SVM) 和径向基函数 (RBF) 核的大象足迹分类。

Result: 在受控条件下，最大验证检测范围为 155.6 m，在自然环境中为 140 m。支持向量机 (SVM) 在多种设置中表现出卓越的性能，在受控环境中实现了 99% 的准确率，在自然大象栖息地中实现了 73% 的准确率，在最具挑战性的人象冲突易发人类栖息地中实现了 70% 的准确率。

Conclusion: 零交叉数和动态时间规整 (DTW) 对齐成本是所有实验中最有影响的因素，而主导频率在受控环境中表现出显着影响。

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

TL;DR: 糖尿病足溃疡 (DFU) 的卸载鞋类通过降低足底压力 (PP) 来帮助预防和治疗 DFU，但处方决策仍然分散。本文回顾了 45 项研究，提出了一个五部分 CDSS 框架，旨在实现可扩展的、以患者为中心的 DFU 护理 CDSS。


<details>

Motivation: 当前卸载鞋类的处方决策分散，特征选择各异，个性化有限，评估实践不同。

Method: 对 45 项研究（12 项指南/协议、25 项基于知识的系统、8 项机器学习应用）进行了叙述性回顾，并对其知识类型、决策逻辑、评估方法和支持技术进行了主题分析。

Result: 指南强调 PP 阈值，但很少产生可操作的、特征级别的输出。基于知识的系统使用规则和传感器驱动的逻辑，集成了 PP 监测、依从性跟踪和可用性测试。ML 工作引入了具有高计算准确性的预测、优化和生成模型，但可解释性和临床验证有限。评估仍然分散：协议优先考虑生物力学测试；基于知识的系统评估可用性/依从性；ML 研究侧重于技术准确性，与长期结果的联系较弱。

Conclusion: 提出了一个五部分 CDSS 框架，旨在实现可扩展的、以患者为中心的 DFU 护理 CDSS；优先考虑可互操作的数据集、可解释的模型和以结果为中心的评估将是临床采用的关键。

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Motivation: 集成方法被认为是机器学习原子间势 (MLIP) 不确定性量化 (UQ) 的黄金标准。然而，它们的高计算成本限制了它的实用性。已经提出了诸如 Monte Carlo dropout 和深度核学习之类的替代技术来提高计算效率；但是，其中某些方法不能应用于已经训练好的模型，并且可能会影响预测准确性。

Method: 该方法模拟 MLIP 预测和地面真实值之间的差异，从而使这些残差可以充当预测不确定性的代理。我们探索了 PDRL 的多个变体，并以已建立的 UQ 方法为基准对它们进行评估，评估它们的有效性和局限性。

Result: 对 PDRL 的多个变体进行了探索，并以已建立的 UQ 方法为基准对它们进行评估。

Conclusion: 对 PDRL 的有效性和局限性进行了评估。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Result: VendiRL能够学习到具有多样性的技能集合。

Conclusion: VendiRL框架通过不同的相似性函数，可以促进各种形式的多样性学习，适用于需要优化多种多样性的交互式环境。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合模型AR-KAN，结合了Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) 和自回归 (AR) 组件的优点，以解决传统神经网络在信号频谱分析中遇到的挑战，尤其是在预测由具有非公度频率的信号组成的几乎周期函数时。


<details>

Motivation: 传统神经网络在信号频谱分析中面临挑战，并且传统的模型在预测由具有非公度频率的信号组成的几乎周期函数时表现不佳。

Method: 结合了Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) 用于静态非线性部分，并通过预训练的AR组件包含记忆，该组件可以解释为保留最有用的信息，同时消除冗余。

Result: 在72%的真实世界数据集上，AR-KAN 提供了卓越的结果。

Conclusion: AR-KAN 模型在真实世界数据集上表现出色，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习（FL）优化器，D-Byz-SGDM，它在部分客户端参与的情况下，对拜占庭攻击具有鲁棒性，并提供了收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法通常假设完全客户端参与，这在现实中是不切实际的，因为存在通信约束和客户端可用性问题。在部分参与的情况下，如果抽样的客户端包含拜占庭多数，现有方法会立即失效，这给稀疏通信带来了根本性的挑战。

Method: 引入了延迟动量聚合，服务器聚合来自非参与客户端的最新接收的梯度，以及来自活跃客户端的新鲜动量。优化器 D-Byz-SGDM 实现了这种延迟动量聚合原则。

Result: 在深度学习任务上的实验验证了理论结果，表明在各种拜占庭攻击下，训练是稳定和鲁棒的。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在部分客户端参与的联邦学习中，对拜占庭攻击具有鲁棒性，并提供了收敛保证，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Motivation: Muon优化器在大型语言模型训练中表现出色，但其学习率的确定方法尚不清楚。AdaGrad是一种广泛使用的自适应方法，但它不具备正交更新的特性。

Method: 将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交更新方向相结合。AdaGO保留了更新方向的正交性，同时通过累积的过去梯度范数来调整步长。

Result: 在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归的实验结果表明，AdaGO优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO在非凸函数上建立了随机和确定性设置下的最优理论收敛速度，并且计算和内存效率高。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

### [142] [Multimodal learning of melt pool dynamics in laser powder bed fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03029)
*Satyajit Mojumder,Pallock Halder,Tiana Tonge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态数据融合方法，结合高保真X射线数据和低保真吸收率数据来预测激光粉末床熔融（LPBF）过程中的熔池动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在增材制造中，并非所有传感器都能提供实用或可靠的过程洞察。高分辨率X射线成像虽然提供了有价值的空间信息，但成本高昂且不切实际；低成本光电二极管的吸收率数据与熔池动态相关，但单独使用时噪声太大，无法进行准确预测。

Method: 该方法集成了卷积神经网络（CNN）和循环神经网络（RNN），通过早期融合策略从X射线数据中提取空间特征，从吸收率信号中提取时间特征。该多模态模型还用作迁移学习模型，以微调仅使用吸收率数据即可预测熔池动态的RNN模型。

Result: 结果表明，与单独使用任何一种模态相比，使用两种模态进行训练可显著提高预测准确性。训练完成后，该模型仅使用吸收率数据即可推断熔池特征，无需昂贵的X射线成像。

Conclusion: 这种多模态融合方法实现了经济高效的实时监控，并在增材制造中具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

*Zida Wu,Mathieu Lauriere,Matthieu Geist,Olivier Pietquin,Ankur Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的深度强化学习（DRL）算法，用于学习Mean Field Games (MFGs) 中的纳什均衡，无需依赖平均或历史采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MFGs中学习纳什均衡仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，尤其是在初始分布未知或人口受到共同噪声的影响时。

Method: 该算法受到Munchausen RL和在线镜像下降的启发，可以在不依赖平均或历史采样的情况下实现依赖于人口的纳什均衡。

Result: 通过对七个典型示例的数值实验表明，该算法比最先进的算法（特别是依赖于人口的策略的虚构博弈的DRL版本）表现出卓越的收敛性。

Conclusion: 在存在共同噪声的情况下，该算法的性能突出了我们方法的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的二值量化优化目标和算法，旨在减少大型语言模型的存储和推理成本，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的二值量化方法会导致明显的性能下降，而保守的4比特量化方法成本较高。

Method: 该方法通过自适应分组策略动态识别最佳非结构化子矩阵，从而增强分块量化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法实现了平均1.007比特的位长，同时保持了较高的模型质量。量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型的困惑度为8.23，非常接近原始模型的7.81，并且优于之前的SOTA BiLLM。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率上与SOTA 4比特方法具有竞争力，并且压缩过程高效，易于并行化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

TL;DR: 提出了 ReLU 转移图 (RTG) 框架，用于理解深度 ReLU 网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解深度 ReLU 网络的泛化能力。

Method: 通过将线性激活区域表示为节点，ReLU 激活翻转的差异连接区域表示为边，构建离散几何结构。

Result: 证明了随机初始化时，RTG 表现出强扩展性、二项式度分布和控制泛化的谱特性。区域熵饱和，谱隙与泛化相关，相邻区域的 KL 散度反映了函数平滑度。

Conclusion: 提供了一个统一的框架，通过离散函数几何的视角分析 ReLU 网络，为理解、诊断和改进泛化提供了新工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

TL;DR: LimiX is a large structured-data model that outperforms existing methods on various tabular tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress toward general intelligence requires foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This paper introduces LimiX as the first of their large structured-data models (LDMs).

Method: LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness and is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective.

Result: LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles across 10 large structured-data benchmarks.

Conclusion: LimiX, a single model with a unified interface, demonstrates superior performance in classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation without task-specific architectures or training.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一个名为 Loong Project 的开源框架，用于在各种推理密集型领域中进行可扩展的合成数据生成和验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力可以通过可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）显著提高，但在其他推理密集型领域中，由于缺乏高质量、可验证的数据集以及高昂的人工监督成本，因此扩展这种成功仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 该框架由两个关键组件组成：(1) LoongBench，一个包含 8,729 个跨 12 个领域的人工审查示例的精选种子数据集，每个示例都配有可执行代码和丰富的元数据；(2) LoongEnv，一个模块化合成数据生成环境，支持多种提示策略来生成新的问答代码三元组。

Result: 在广泛的开源和专有 LLM 套件上对 LoongBench 进行了基准测试，以评估领域覆盖范围并揭示性能瓶颈。此外，对 LoongEnv 生成的合成数据进行了全面分析，检查了正确性、难度和多样性。

Conclusion: Loong Project 为各种推理密集型领域中可扩展的合成数据生成和验证提供了一个有用的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Motivation: SAM在分布式大批量训练中效率低下。

Method: 将SAM的对抗步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成异步分布式采样方案，从而产生平滑的锐度感知损失 landscape 用于优化。

Result: 消除了同步瓶颈，加速了大批量收敛，并提供了比数据并行SAM更高的最终精度。

Conclusion: LSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时，提供了卓越的效率。

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为深度分层周期规划器 (DHCP) 的 DRL 模型，用于分层分配交通信号周期时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 DRL 的 TSC 方法中的“选择相位”策略可能导致意外的相位序列，而“切换”策略可能导致不公平和低效的相位分配。

Method: 使用一个高层智能体确定南北 (NS) 和东西 (EW) 方向之间的总周期时间的分配，然后一个低层智能体进一步划分每个主要方向内直行和左转移动之间的分配时长。

Result: 在真实和合成道路网络以及多组真实和合成交通流量上测试了该模型，经验结果表明该模型在所有数据集中都优于基线。

Conclusion: DHCP 模型在交通信号控制方面表现出色。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Motivation: 传统TDCR方法自动化程度低，依赖混合物特定标准源。

Result: 模型在活度比例、探测效率和光谱重建方面均表现出高精度。

Conclusion: 该AI方法具有自动化、安全、通用性强、实时处理等优点，尤其适用于参考材料不可用或需要快速现场分析的场景。

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，验证和信任模型至关重要。然而，XAI的可靠性受到Rashomon效应的挑战，该效应指的是多个同样准确的模型可能对相同的预测提供不同的解释。

Method: 本文使用定性可解释图（QXG）作为符号场景表示，训练了两类不同的模型：可解释的、基于配对的梯度提升模型和复杂的、基于图的图神经网络（GNN）。使用特征归因方法，测量了这些类之间和类内部解释的一致性。

Result: 研究结果表明，解释存在显著分歧。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，解释模糊性是问题本身固有的属性，而不仅仅是建模的人为产物。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的归因方法评估协议在单一阈值下二值化归因图，导致阈值选择偏差，会颠倒方法排名并破坏结论。

Method: 该论文提出了一种无阈值的框架，该框架计算交并集的曲线下面积 (AUC-IoU)，从而捕获整个阈值范围内的归因质量。

Result: 在皮肤病学影像上的评估表明，单阈值指标会产生矛盾的结果，而无阈值评估可提供可靠的区分。XRAI 比 LIME 提高了 31%，比 vanilla 集成梯度提高了 204%，并且按大小分层的分析显示，病变尺度上的性能变化高达 269%。

Conclusion: 该论文建立了一种消除评估伪影并支持循证方法选择的方法标准。无阈值框架为归因行为提供了理论见解，并为医学影像及其他领域的稳健比较提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Result: 通过实验对提出的两种新方法进行了表征。

Conclusion: 本文研究了决策树中的公平性问题，并提出了两种新的模型构建方法。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

### [156] [TeRA: Vector-based Random Tensor Network for High-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03234)
*Yuxuan Gu,Wuyang Zhou,Giorgos Iacovides,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，名为TeRA，它在保持向量化方法参数效率的同时，实现了高秩权重更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA改进方法在高秩适配器的模型表达能力和向量化方法的参数效率之间存在权衡。

Method: 该方法通过将张量化的权重更新矩阵参数化为一个类Tucker张量网络（TN），其中大的随机初始化因子被冻结并在层之间共享，而只训练由对角因子矩阵中的条目形成的小的层特定缩放向量。

Result: 实验表明，TeRA在需要与向量化方法相似的可训练参数数量的情况下，匹配甚至优于高秩适配器。

Conclusion: 理论分析和消融研究进一步验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于窗口的F1指标（F1_w），用于更稳健地评估事件检测，特别是在时间序列中事件具有时间弥散性的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的F1和点调整F1（F1_pa）等标准指标在实际、不平衡的数据集中，无法准确反映模型性能，尤其是在事件具有时间弥散性的情况下。

Method: 引入一种基于窗口的F1指标（F1_w），该指标结合了时间容忍度。

Result: 在三个生理数据集（ADARP、Wrist Angel和ROAD）上的实证分析表明，F1_w揭示了传统指标无法显示的有效模型性能模式。时间容忍度量标准揭示了在两个实际用例中，TimesFM相对于随机和空基线的统计显着性改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作解决了时间序列评估中的关键差距，并为医疗保健应用提供了实用指导，其中对时间精度的要求因环境而异。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Motivation: 在无线系统中，为了满足对高数据速率和无缝连接的需求，研究人员对RIS和基于人工智能的无线应用产生了浓厚的兴趣。如何有效地将RIS元件分配给多个用户设备(UE)是关键。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统在降低计算复杂度的同时实现了更好的性能，使其比迭代优化算法更具可扩展性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为TopoMap的方法，用于创建输入特征空间的地形图，以解决深度学习系统测试中的挑战。TopoMap通过降维和聚类将输入分组，并使用深度神经网络来评估不同的嵌入和聚类配置，从而自动选择最佳的地形图。实验结果表明，TopoMap生成的地图由可区分且有意义的区域组成，并且在变异分析中优于随机选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习测试方法主要集中在特定失效诱导特征上，忽略了特征空间中其他区域的特征。因此，需要一种能够对输入特征空间进行显式地形图绘制的方法。

Method: 该方法首先对输入进行降维以获得嵌入，然后进行聚类。为了评估不同的嵌入和聚类配置，使用深度神经网络作为人类评估者的近似，以判断一对聚类是否可以基于其包含元素的特征进行区分。使用该网络自动选择最佳的地形图。

Result: 实验结果表明，TopoMap生成的地图由可区分且有意义的区域组成。此外，在可杀死的突变体上，TopoMap的性能平均优于随机选择35%；在不可杀死的突变体上，优于随机选择61%。

Conclusion: TopoMap能够有效地将输入特征空间划分为可区分的区域，并且在变异分析中表现出色，证明了其在深度学习系统测试中的有效性。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Conclusion: 用大量合成数据预训练基础模型可以使其更好地适应未知问题，而无需在优化过程中进行任何后续模型训练或更新。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Result: 结构转移能够跨不同的表征系统生成目标表征，并确保源表征和目标表征满足任何指定的关系。

Conclusion: 结构转移是一种系统无关的演算，可用于在广泛的实际环境中识别替代表征。

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

Motivation: 传统加密货币异常交易检测方法难以应对类别不平衡、时间波动和复杂的网络依赖性，且只能事后检测，预防价值有限。

Method: HyPV-LEAD 框架结合了窗口-horizon建模、峰谷 (PV) 采样和双曲嵌入三种创新技术。

Result: 在比特币交易数据上的实验结果表明，HyPV-LEAD 优于现有技术，PR-AUC 达到 0.9624，并在精确率和召回率方面有显著提高。

Conclusion: HyPV-LEAD 将异常检测从被动分类转变为主动预警，为动态区块链环境中的实时风险管理、反洗钱合规性和金融安全奠定了基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation

Conclusion: 为高维系统中多稳态建模提供了一种原则性和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解在差分隐私（DP）下训练的生成对抗网络（GANs）和扩散模型对成员推理攻击（MIAs）的敏感性，这是对数据机密性的主要威胁，但目前对此了解不足。

Method: 通过基于稳定性的分析，证明GANs比扩散模型对数据扰动表现出更低的敏感性，并通过全面的实证研究，使用标准化的MIA流程评估跨数据集和隐私预算的隐私泄露情况，以此来验证该理论分析。

Result: 研究结果一致表明，即使在强DP机制下，GANs也具有显著的隐私鲁棒性优势，表明模型类型本身可以严重影响隐私泄露。

Conclusion: GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有优于扩散模型的结构性优势，模型类型是影响隐私泄露的关键因素。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Conclusion: 生成模型和预测模型的结合可以辅助表位发现，并且该方法仅使用线性表位的一级氨基酸序列，绕过了对序列的几何框架或手工设计的特征的需求。

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Conclusion: 探索了公平性水平如何影响最弱势、最优势和平均智能体，为公平的 fleet 智能提供见解。

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

*Bhanu Sharma,Eugene Pinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究分析了61个国家/地区的平均睡眠时间，以检验夏令时 (DST) 做法的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究夏令时对睡眠的影响，并找出影响睡眠的关键指标。

Method: 通过统计相关分析探索这些因素之间的关系。根据夏令时遵守情况对国家/地区进行分组，并比较 DST 和非 DST 区域之间的睡眠模式。

Result: 平均而言，遵守夏令时的国家/地区的睡眠时间往往比不遵守夏令时的国家/地区长。在较低纬度地区，遵守夏令时的国家/地区的睡眠时间短于不遵守夏令时的国家/地区，而在较高纬度地区，遵守夏令时的国家/地区的平均睡眠时间更长。

Conclusion: DST 对睡眠的影响可能受到地理位置的影响。

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了似然函数的校准，并将其从二元情况推广到多元情况，利用单纯形的 Aitchison 几何来处理多个假设，最后通过一个非线性判别分析的应用展示了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 校准概率预测已被广泛研究，但似然函数的校准研究较少，尤其是在生物识别中，仅限于二元互斥假设的情况。

Method: 使用单纯形的 Aitchison 几何，将对数似然比（LLR）和证据权重扩展到任意数量的假设，定义了多元假设下的校准、幂等性以及似然函数分布的约束。

Result: 将校准、幂等性和似然函数分布的约束扩展到多元假设和多类情况下的等距对数比变换似然函数。通过非线性判别分析的应用，验证了该方法可以提高可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文主要为概念性的研究，但通过在机器学习中的应用，展示了所提出方法的有效性，即判别成分形成了类上的校准似然函数，从而提高了方法的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

*Duy A. Nguyen,Abhi Kamboj,Minh N. Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult是一个可扩展的框架，旨在通过保留模态特定信息和利用冗余来缓解多模态学习中的挑战，例如缺失模态和有限的标记数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺失模态和有限标记数据对于推进鲁棒的多模态学习至关重要。

Method: Robult优化两个核心目标：(1) 软正-无标记(PU)对比损失，最大化任务相关特征对齐，同时有效利用半监督设置中有限的标记数据；(2) 潜在重建损失，确保保留独特的模态特定信息。这些策略嵌入在模块化设计中。

Result: 在各种数据集上的实验结果验证了Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态上下文中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Robult的轻量级设计促进了可扩展性，并能与现有架构无缝集成，使其适用于实际的多模态应用。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

*Elizabeth Coda,Ery Arias-Castro,Gal Mishne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种更透明、模块化的方法，用于可视化具有潜在（潜在）聚类结构的数据，该方法包括首先对数据进行聚类，然后嵌入每个聚类，最后对齐聚类以获得全局嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法虽然能够很好地对数据点进行分组，同时嵌入它们，产生具有良好分离的聚类的可视化效果，但它们也倾向于扭曲底层数据的全局几何结构。

Method: 首先对数据进行聚类，然后嵌入每个聚类，最后对齐聚类以获得全局嵌入。

Result: 在几个合成和真实世界的数据集上证明了这种方法，并表明它与现有方法相比具有竞争力，同时更加透明。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种更透明、模块化的方法，可以有效地可视化具有潜在聚类结构的数据，同时保持与现有方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用图神经网络（GNN）处理 sepsis 病人数据，以辅助确定静脉输液和血管加压药的用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在 sepsis 治疗中，确定合适的静脉输液和血管加压药用量是一个挑战。以往研究依赖关系数据，但现代医疗数据的复杂性使得图表示可能更自然有效。

Method: 将 MIMIC-III 数据集中的病人数据建模为异构图，并使用 GraphSAGE 和 GATv2 两种图神经网络架构学习病人状态表征。采用解耦表示学习和策略学习的方法，训练编码器生成潜在状态表征，并使用解码器预测下一个病人状态。然后，这些表征被用于 dBCQ 算法的策略学习。

Result: 实验结果证实了基于图的方法的潜力，同时也强调了该领域中表征学习的复杂性。

Conclusion: 图神经网络在 sepsis 治疗决策支持方面具有潜力，但表征学习仍然是一个挑战。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

*Chenlu Ye,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Hao Chen,Narayanan Sadagopan,Jing Huang,Tong Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据处理方法，通过结合粗粒度的结果奖励和细粒度的过程奖励来提高强化学习在数学推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在数学推理任务中，要么奖励过于粗糙，无法区分推理过程的优劣，要么容易受到奖励机制的攻击。

Method: 提出了一种名为PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF) 的数据处理方法，该方法通过一致性驱动的样本选择，协调噪声的细粒度过程奖励和准确的粗粒度结果奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在最终准确率上比混合方法提高了4%，并且提高了中间推理步骤的质量。

Conclusion: PROF方法能够有效提高强化学习在数学推理任务中的性能，通过结合过程奖励和结果奖励的优点，选择一致性样本，从而改进推理过程的质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

TL;DR: 本文研究了样条 KAN 的初始化方案，提出了两种受 LeCun 和 Glorot 启发的理论驱动方法，以及一个具有可调指数的经验幂律族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs 是一种最近提出的神经架构，它用可训练的激活函数代替固定的非线性，从而增强了灵活性和可解释性。虽然 KAN 已成功应用于科学和机器学习任务，但它们的初始化策略在很大程度上仍未得到探索。

Method: 结合了函数拟合和前向 PDE 基准的大规模网格搜索、通过神经正切核分析训练动态以及在 Feynman 数据集子集上的评估。

Result: Glorot 启发的初始化在参数丰富的模型中明显优于基线，而幂律初始化在各种任务和不同大小的架构中都实现了最强的整体性能。

Conclusion: 本文研究表明，Glorot 启发的初始化和幂律初始化能够提升 KAN 模型的性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

TL;DR: LINKER 是一个序列模型，它只使用蛋白质序列和配体 SMILES 作为输入，来预测残基-功能组的相互作用类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别蛋白质残基和配体功能组之间的相互作用对于理解分子识别和指导合理的药物设计至关重要。现有的蛋白质-配体可解释性的深度学习方法通常依赖于 3D 结构输入或使用基于距离的接触标签，限制了它们的适用性和生物学相关性。

Method: LINKER 是一种序列模型，它使用蛋白质序列和配体 SMILES 作为输入，根据生物学定义的相互作用类型预测残基-功能组的相互作用。LINKER 经过结构监督的注意力训练，其中相互作用标签来自 3D 蛋白质-配体复合物，通过基于功能组的motif提取。

Result: 在 LP-PDBBind 基准上的实验表明，基于功能组抽象的结构信息监督产生的相互作用预测与真实生物化学注释密切相关。

Conclusion: LINKER 只需要序列级别的输入，这使得它可以在结构数据不可用的大规模环境中应用。

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的框架，用于学习刚性物体相互作用和主动操作下液体的动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据驱动方法通常局限于学习静态自由落体环境或涉及原始对象的简单操作设置中的流体行为，经常忽略与动态移动的运动学刚体的复杂相互作用。

Method: 该方法基于图神经网络，其中粒子表示为图节点，并使用具有边界体积层次结构（BVH）算法的表面表示来处理粒子-对象碰撞。

Result: 该模型能够准确地捕捉动态环境中的流体行为，并且可以推广到具有未见过的对象和新的操作任务（如搅拌和舀取）的环境中。此外，学习到的动力学可用于使用基于梯度的优化方法解决控制和操作任务。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GNN框架能够有效地模拟液体在复杂环境下的动力学行为，并具有良好的泛化能力，可用于解决控制和操作任务。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

*Yubo Gao,Renbo Tu,Gennady Pekhimenko,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD中量化会导致精度显著下降，因为噪声注入会放大量化方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DP-SGD训练中，量化是一种常用的降低训练时间、能耗和成本的技术。然而，量化会导致DP-SGD的精度显著下降。

Method: 提出了一种动态量化框架QPQuant，该框架自适应地选择每个epoch中要量化的层子集。该方法结合了两种关键思想：(i)层的概率抽样，它每隔一个epoch旋转一次量化的层，(ii)损失感知层优先级，它使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器来识别可以量化且对模型质量影响最小的层。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121等数据集上进行的经验评估表明，DPQuant始终优于静态量化基线，实现了接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，并在低精度硬件上实现了高达2.21倍的理论吞吐量改进，验证精度下降不到2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant 是一种有效的 DP-SGD 量化方法，可在不牺牲过多精度的情况下提高效率。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Result: 揭示了 TwF 对应于控制函数沿着 Banach 子流形的切线空间的连续/变形。

Conclusion: 为 TwF 在顺序训练期间的映射保持（不遗忘）提供了理论基础，超越了一阶近似。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在LLM-RL训练中收益甚微，因为LLM的响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏。

Method: 提出AEnt方法，使用带自动调整系数的新型钳制熵奖励。钳制熵通过在较小的token空间上重新定义的策略进行评估，从而鼓励在更紧凑的响应集中进行探索。算法根据钳制熵值自动调整熵系数。

Result: 在不同的基础模型和数据集的数学推理任务中测试了AEnt，观察到AEnt在多个基准测试中始终优于基线。

Conclusion: AEnt方法在LLM-RL中有效，并在数学推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

Motivation: 边缘设备的内存和通信约束可能会阻止他们参与联邦学习训练，导致部分数据无法访问并增加系统偏差。

Method: 设计了一种联邦、内存高效的零阶优化器ZOWarmUp，它利用不同的客户端能力和仔细的方差减少技术，以促进低资源客户端参与模型训练。ZOWarmUp消除了边缘设备向服务器传输完整梯度的需要，而是依赖于一小组随机种子。

Result: 在各种数据集和模型架构上进行的实验表明，ZOWarmUp是一种鲁棒的算法，可以在各种情况下应用。对于具有高比例边缘设备的系统，否则将被排除在训练之外，该算法可以访问更大量和多样化的数据，从而改善训练结果。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp算法能够使更多低资源设备参与联邦学习，从而提高训练效果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是大型语言模型（LLM）在各种任务中展示出了令人印象深刻的能力，但它们在现实世界应用中日益增长的自主性引发了对其可信度的担忧。虽然幻觉——无意的错误——已被广泛研究，但说谎现象，即 LLM 明知地产生虚假信息以实现不可告人的目的，仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过机制可解释性技术，我们揭示了欺骗背后的神经机制，采用 logit lens 分析、因果干预和对比激活引导来识别和控制欺骗行为。我们研究了真实世界的说谎场景，并引入了行为引导向量，可以对说谎倾向进行细粒度的操纵。

Result: 我们探索了说谎和最终任务表现之间的权衡，建立了一个帕累托前沿，不诚实可以提高目标优化。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果有助于更广泛的人工智能伦理讨论，揭示了在高风险环境中部署 LLM 的风险和潜在的安全措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at
