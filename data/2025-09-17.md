*Nikolay Banar,Ehsan Lotfi,Jens Van Nooten,Cristina Arhiliuc,Marija Kliocaite,Walter Daelemans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文旨在通过发布新的资源来弥补荷兰语嵌入资源的不足，包括评估和生成资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在多语言资源中代表性不足，为了促进荷兰语嵌入的进一步发展。

Method: 1. 引入了荷兰语大规模文本嵌入基准（MTEB-NL），包括现有和新创建的荷兰语数据集，涵盖广泛的任务。
2. 提供了一个训练数据集，该数据集由可用的荷兰语检索数据集编译而成，并辅以大型语言模型生成的合成数据，以扩展检索之外的任务覆盖范围。
3. 发布了一系列 E5-NL 模型，这些模型紧凑而高效，在多个任务中表现出色。

Result: 发布了一系列 E5-NL 模型，这些模型紧凑而高效，在多个任务中表现出色。所有资源均通过 Hugging Face Hub 和 MTEB 软件包公开提供。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提供新的基准、数据集和模型，为荷兰语嵌入的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [2] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为MORABLES的基准，用于评估LLM在道德推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM进行复杂抽象推理和推断的能力，特别是在具有丰富叙事和道德深度的文学作品中。

Method: 构建了一个基于历史文献中的寓言和短篇故事的人工验证基准，主要任务是多项选择题，目标是道德推理，并精心设计了干扰项。

Result: 结果表明，虽然较大的模型优于较小的模型，但它们仍然容易受到对抗性操纵，并且经常依赖于肤浅的模式而不是真正的道德推理。

Conclusion: 模型的脆弱性导致显著的自我矛盾，最好的模型在大约20%的情况下反驳了自己的答案。推理增强模型未能弥合这一差距，表明规模而非推理能力是性能的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Judge: Rapid Evaluation of Legal Document Recommendation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12382)
*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）作为评估检索增强生成（RAG）系统在法律领域表现的评判方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐系统评估指标在法律等专业领域无法捕捉细微的质量维度；需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 通过系统实验，研究了哪些inter-rater可靠性指标最能捕捉LLM和人类评估之间的一致性，以及如何在竞争系统之间进行统计学上合理的比较。

Result: 发现Krippendorff's alpha等传统一致性指标具有误导性，Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数是更稳健的指标；Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test与Benjamini-Hochberg校正为系统比较提供了统计严谨性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可以使用可扩展的、具有成本效益的评估方法，同时保持法律应用所需的精度，将人工瓶颈转变为自动化的评估框架。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

### [4] [SENTRA: Selected-Next-Token Transformer for LLM Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12385)
*Mitchell Plyler,Yilun Zhang,Alexander Tuzhilin,Saoud Khalifah,Sen Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的、通用的、有监督的LLM文本检测器SENTRA，用于检测未明确声明为LLM生成的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力的增强和应用范围的扩大，其滥用的可能性也在增加，因此需要检测LLM生成的文本。

Method: SENTRA是一种基于Transformer的编码器，它利用选择的下一个token概率序列，并在大量未标记数据上进行对比预训练。

Result: 在三个流行的公共数据集上进行的实验表明，SENTRA是一种通用的分类器，在跨越24个文本领域的域外设置中明显优于流行的基线模型。

Conclusion: SENTRA在域外检测LLM生成文本方面表现出色。

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

### [5] [MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405)
*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一种新的多语言基准测试，旨在评估医学领域 NLG 评估指标的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评估指标在区分高质量输出方面存在不足，尤其是在医学问答任务中。

Method: 构建了一个名为 MORQA 的多语言基准，该基准包含由医学专业人士编写的多个标准答案，并对英语和中文子集进行了专家人工评估。

Result: 基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的评估方法在与专家判断的相关性方面明显优于传统指标。

Conclusion: 结果强调了医学领域中需要与人类对齐的评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

### [6] [MedFact: Benchmarking the Fact-Checking Capabilities of Large Language Models on Chinese Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12440)
*Jiayi He,Yangmin Huang,Qianyun Du,Xiangying Zhou,Zhiyang He,Jiaxue Hu,Xiaodong Tao,Lixian Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的中文医学事实核查基准MedFact，包含2116个实例，涵盖13个医学专业。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准的数据领域狭窄，无法捕捉真实医学信息的复杂性。

Method: 采用AI辅助人工的方法构建MedFact，并通过专家反馈迭代优化。

Result: 对20个LLM进行了评估，发现模型在确定文本是否包含错误方面表现尚可，但在精确定位错误方面仍面临巨大挑战，且存在过度批评现象。

Conclusion: MedFact 为开发更可靠和更具有医学意识的模型提供了一个强大的资源。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

### [7] [Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451)
*Wonbin Kweon,SeongKu Kang,Runchu Tian,Pengcheng Jiang,Jiawei Han,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 TopicK 的检索框架，该框架通过选择能够全面覆盖与测试输入和模型相关的topic级别知识的demonstration来提高上下文学习的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常只基于嵌入相似性或生成概率来检索demonstration，导致出现不相关或冗余的例子。为了解决这个问题，本文旨在识别和覆盖细粒度的知识需求。

Method: TopicK 估计输入所需的topic，并评估模型在这些topic上的知识。然后，TopicK 迭代地选择demonstration，这些demonstration 引入了先前未覆盖的所需topic，其中模型表现出较低的topic知识。

Result: 通过在各种数据集以及开源和闭源 LLM 上的大量实验，验证了 TopicK 的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK 是一种有效的检索框架，可以通过选择能够全面覆盖与测试输入和模型相关的topic级别知识的demonstration来提高上下文学习的有效性。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

### [8] [Does Language Model Understand Language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12459)
*Suvojit Acharjee,Utathya Aich,Asfak Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了最先进的语言模型在处理细粒度语言现象（如时态、否定、语态和情态）方面的能力，这些现象对于有效的人际沟通至关重要。研究人员创建了一个名为 LUCID 的新数据集，其中包含精心设计的英语和孟加拉语句对，专门用于挑战这些模型在语言理解的关键方面（包括否定、时态、语态变化）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联合国可持续发展目标 4 的背景下，语言清晰度至关重要，语言模型在教育技术中的部署需要仔细审查。由于语言模型越来越多地为辅导系统、自动评分和翻译等应用程序提供支持，因此它们与人类语言解释的一致性对于有效的学习至关重要。

Method: 研究人员使用标准指标（如皮尔逊相关系数、斯皮尔曼相关系数和平均绝对误差）以及一种新颖的、受语言启发的指标 HCE 准确率，评估了包括 MISTRAL-SABA-24B、LLaMA-4-Scout-17B、LLaMA-3.3-70B、Gemma2-9B 和 Compound-Beta 在内的最先进模型的性能。HCE 准确率衡量模型预测值在多大程度上落在平均人类评分的一个标准差范围内，从而捕捉到人类对语言解释中可变性的容忍度。

Result: 研究结果表明，Compound-Beta 是最平衡的模型，在不同的语言条件下始终如一地实现了高相关性和低 MAE。它在英语中记录了最高的皮尔逊相关系数，并在混合语言数据中表现出强大的性能，表明在跨语言场景中与人类判断具有很强的一致性。

Conclusion: 总而言之，该研究强调了在教育技术等领域中，语言模型需要更好地理解和处理细粒度的语言现象，并提出了 LUCID 数据集作为评估和改进这些模型的一种手段。

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

### [9] [Audited Reasoning Refinement: Fine-Tuning Language Models via LLM-Guided Step-Wise Evaluation and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12476)
*Sumanta Bhattacharyya,Sara Riaz,Pedram Rooshenas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA) 的方法，用于在缺乏人工监督的情况下训练特定任务的小型推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏高质量标签或人工监督的情况下，训练特定任务的小型推理模型具有挑战性。大型语言模型 (LLM) 具有推理能力，可以生成大量中间推理轨迹，这些轨迹可以被系统地完善，以创建有效的监督信号。

Method: R2tA方法首先从开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应，然后完善这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致，形成高质量的数据集。然后，进行两阶段对齐，即监督微调 (SFT)，然后是直接偏好优化 (DPO)，以根据人工验证的概念偏好校准模型的中间推理，然后根据对齐的推理调节最终输出。

Result: 在数据库系统设计中评估扩展实体关系图 (EERD) 的案例研究表明，R2tA 提供了一条实用且经济高效的途径，可在数据稀缺领域实现可扩展的 LLM 适应，从而为教育及其他领域提供可重现的 AI 工具。通过在包含 600 个 EERD 变体（训练/测试集分别为 450/150）的数据集上进行实验，这些变体包含 11 个类别的错误。

Conclusion: R2tA 是一种在数据稀缺领域实现可扩展 LLM 适应的实用且经济高效的途径，为教育及其他领域提供可重现的 AI 工具。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

TL;DR: FunAudio-ASR是一个大规模的、基于LLM的ASR系统，它结合了大量数据、大型模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，以在各种复杂的语音识别场景中实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）容易产生幻觉，这会显著降低实际ASR应用中的用户体验。

Method: 结合大量数据、大型模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习。

Result: FunAudio-ASR在实际应用数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR在实际环境中展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

*Chiara Bonfanti,Michele Colombino,Giulia Coucourde,Faeze Memari,Stefano Pinardi,Rosa Meo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种训练基于 Transformer 的神经网络以生成 Bambara 语机器翻译器的流水线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这项工作的动机是为非洲约 14,188,850 人使用的曼德语 Bambara 语开发机器翻译器。

Method: 第一种流水线训练一个简单的 Transformer 将法语句子翻译成 Bambara 语。第二种流水线使用仅解码器架构微调 LLaMA3 (3B-8B) 指导模型，用于法语到 Bambara 语的翻译。第三种流水线使用学生-教师双神经网络的语言知识蒸馏将 Bambara 语集成到预训练的 LaBSE 模型中，该模型提供与语言无关的嵌入。

Result: 结果表明，第一种流水线虽然更简单，但实现了最佳的翻译准确率（在 Bayelemagaba 上为 10% BLEU，21% chrF），这与低资源翻译结果一致。在为此工作创建的 Yiri 数据集上，它实现了 33.81% 的 BLEU 和 41% 的 chrF。

Conclusion: 基于指导的模型在单个数据集上的表现优于在聚合集合上的表现，这表明它们更有效地捕获数据集特定的模式。

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

*Heng Zhang,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的框架，通过挖掘全文的学术论文来生成全面的、结构化的研究工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常只提取零碎的程序组件，因此无法捕获完整的研究工作流程。

Method: 段落中心方法，首先采用带有SciBERT的PU学习来识别工作流描述段落，然后利用带有prompt learning的Flan-T5从这些段落中生成工作流短语，使用ChatGPT进行分类，最后生成整个研究工作流程的可读可视化流程图。

Result: 在自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得了良好的效果，并揭示了过去二十年中关键的方法论转变，包括越来越重视数据分析以及从特征工程到消融研究的转变。

Conclusion: 提供了一个经过验证的自动工作流程生成技术框架，以及一个新颖的、面向过程的视角，用于对不断发展的科学范式进行实证研究。

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本音频字幕系统，利用预训练模型生成音频字幕，无需大量训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频字幕数据集有限，为了克服这个问题。

Method: 使用预训练的音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征并生成结构化提示，以指导大型语言模型（LLM）生成字幕。通过音频CLIP模型改进token选择，确保与音频内容对齐。

Result: 使用WavCaps模型进行MAGIC搜索后，NLG平均得分提高了35%（从4.7提高到7.3）。

Conclusion: 性能受音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择的影响很大，使用单个关键词提示可获得最佳结果，不使用关键词列表时性能下降50%。

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

TL;DR: 本文旨在提高自动定理证明（ATP）中大型语言模型（LLM）的效率，通过减少token使用和采样次数，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ATP模型依赖反射性CoT推理和增加采样次数来提高性能，但计算开销大，且成本分析忽略了不同scaling策略带来的采样成本差异。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：动态CoT切换机制，减少不必要的token消耗；多样化的并行scaled强化学习（RL），通过可训练的前缀提高约束采样次数下的通过率，并集成到EconRL流程中。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet上的实验表明，EconProver仅用baseline方法12%的计算成本就达到了相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为部署轻量级ATP模型提供了可操作的见解，且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

TL;DR: RoPE在长文本建模中存在距离依赖偏差，限制了其性能。本文提出了Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，一种新的位置编码方法，可以解决RoPE的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在长文本建模中存在不足，需要新的方法来改进。

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，将可学习的相位函数融入注意力机制。

Result: TAPA在长文本上实现了更低的困惑度，并且能够推广到未见过的长度。

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的位置编码方法，可以解决RoPE在长文本建模中的局限性。

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种发音感知上下文 (PAC) 框架，以解决基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的自动语音识别 (ASR) 系统中的两个关键挑战：有效的发音建模和稳健的同音词辨别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的自动语音识别 (ASR) 系统中的发音建模和同音词辨别问题，这对于原始或长尾词识别至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段学习范例。首先，引入了一种发音引导的上下文学习方法，采用交错字形-音素上下文建模策略，结合纯字形干扰，鼓励模型利用音素线索进行准确识别。然后，提出了一种带有扰动标签抽样的发音区分强化学习方法，以进一步提高模型区分上下文同音词的能力。

Result: 在 LibriSpeech 和 AISHELL-1 数据集上，PAC 相对于预训练的 LLM ASR 模型，词错误率 (WER) 相对降低了 30.2% 和 53.8%；对于长尾词，有偏 WER 相对降低了 31.8% 和 60.5%。

Conclusion: PAC 框架在发音建模和同音词辨别方面表现出色，显著提高了 ASR 系统的性能，尤其是在长尾词识别方面。

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测大型语言模型(llm)中意识形态偏差的方法，该方法通过分析与特定主题相关的提示下模型输出的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地嵌入到数百万用户使用的产品中，它们的输出可能会影响个人信仰，并累积地影响公众舆论。如果大型语言模型的行为可以被有意地引导到特定的意识形态立场，那么控制这些系统的人可能会获得对公共话语的不成比例的影响。

Method: 本文采用了一种先前提出的统计方法，并将其应用于意识形态偏差审计的新环境中。该方法具有模型无关的设计，不需要访问语言模型的内部结构。通过分析与所选主题相关的提示下模型输出的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态引导。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的实际应用及其支持对大型语言模型行为进行独立事后审计的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种检测大型语言模型(llm)中意识形态偏差的方法，该方法具有模型无关的设计，适用于审计专有的黑盒系统，并通过实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在提供有效的情感支持对话（ESC）方面面临挑战，因为策略规划的准确性较低，并且对特定策略存在显著的偏好偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表明，微调策略规划器在减少这种偏见方面具有潜力，但大型语言模型中偏好偏差的根本原因尚未得到充分研究。为了解决这些问题，我们首先通过识别大型语言模型在策略规划中的知识边界来揭示偏差的根本原因。

Method: 提出了一种通过强化学习和双重奖励函数来缓解偏差的方法，该方法根据知识边界优化每个区域的策略规划，同时考虑准确性和基于熵的置信度。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上进行的多项实验表明，我们的方法优于基线方法，证实了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型语言模型在情感支持对话中策略规划的偏见原因，并提出了一种有效的缓解方法。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注文本成本高，限制了TBPS的可扩展性和实际部署。

Method: 引入MTG和MTI两个互补模块。MTG通过模拟对话生成丰富的伪标签，MTI在推理时通过动态对话细化用户查询。

Result: 无需人工标注的情况下，该方法取得了有竞争力的结果，

Conclusion: 为TBPS系统的可扩展和实际部署铺平了道路

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

*Shaz Furniturewala,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型生成的内容激增，对内容审核系统提出了新的挑战。传统的审核分类器在处理LLM生成的内容时，由于数据偏差和对抗性攻击，容易出现错误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容审核系统对LLM生成内容的检测能力不足，且防御策略偏向被动响应。

Method: 利用可解释性技术，找出 токсичность 分类器中易受攻击的组件。通过对抗攻击识别脆弱的神经网络回路，并进行抑制。

Result: 发现模型中存在对性能至关重要或易受攻击的特定神经网络头，抑制易受攻击的头可以提高对抗性输入的性能。不同的人口群体对不同的神经网络头负责。

Conclusion: 通过识别和抑制 токсичность 分类器中的脆弱组件，可以提高模型对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，并提升模型对不同人口群体的公平性。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR 解码依赖于从文本生成模型中抽取的样本文本，难以正确捕获领域外知识或信息。

Method: 提出 CBDT 解码，使用领域数据的例子来估计预期效用。将 CBDT 解码与 MBR 解码结合。

Result: CBDT 解码生成了比 MAP 解码质量更高的文本。MBR 和 CBDT 解码的组合在多个翻译和图像字幕任务中优于 MBR 解码。

Conclusion: CBDT 解码可以有效提升文本生成质量，尤其是在领域外任务中。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间推理数据集在规模、多语言覆盖和对当代事件的关注方面存在局限性。

Method: 从维基百科的时间线页面和文章信息框中提取历史事件，构建多语言数据库，并设计涵盖6个时间QA推理任务的基准。

Result: GPT4o在所有答案类型和语言中表现最佳；Gemma-2优于其他小型语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在为推进历史事件的多语言和时间感知自然语言理解提供全面的资源。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究VLMs是否具备概念抽象能力，以及如何通过编码更高层次的概念信息来增强VLM的这种能力。

Method: 引入了一个分组图像-标题数据集(MAGIC)，并使用一种新颖的对比损失技术，促使模型在每个图像(标题)的表示中编码该组所有成员共有的信息。

Result: CLEAR GLASS模型展现出概念抽象能力，并在抽象概念识别方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该训练方法使模型能够创建图像-标题组的语义表示，使其更接近潜在语义空间中更高层次概念的语义表示，从而提高抽象概念识别能力。

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种有效的范例，用于生成可靠的、结构化的、长篇文档，为在高风险、知识密集型领域中更强大的LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

TL;DR: 探讨了使用阿拉伯语资源通过跨语言增强技术来支持马耳他语自然语言处理 (NLP) 的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 马耳他语是一种独特的闪米特语，在罗曼语和日耳曼语的影响下发展而来，特别是意大利语和英语。尽管它有闪米特语的根源，但其正字法是基于拉丁文字，这使得它与其在阿拉伯语中最接近的语言亲属之间存在差距。

Method: 研究了多种将阿拉伯语文本数据与马耳他语对齐的策略，包括各种音译方案和机器翻译 (MT) 方法。作为其中的一部分，我们还引入了更好地表示马耳他语正字法的新型音译系统。

Result: 评估了这些增强对单语和多语模型的影响，并证明了基于阿拉伯语的增强可以显着benefitt 马耳他语 NLP 任务。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语增强可以显著benefitt 马耳他语 NLP 任务

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Motivation: 探讨大型视觉语言模型在多媒体事件提取任务中的应用，因为现有研究较少。

Method: 在M2E2数据集上评估了具有代表性的LVLMs，包括文本、图像和跨媒体子任务，采用少量样本提示和微调设置。

Result: 少量样本LVLMs在视觉任务上表现更好，但在文本任务上表现不佳；使用LoRA进行微调可以显著提高模型性能；LVLMs在结合模态时表现出强大的协同作用，在跨模态设置中实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 语义精度、定位和跨模态基础仍然是提高M2E2能力的关键障碍。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的难度估计方法，该方法仅利用目标LLM产生的隐藏表示，无需生成任何输出token即可实现高效准确的难度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估大型语言模型（LLM）的性能和自适应推理，估计输入问题的难度至关重要。现有方法通常依赖于重复响应抽样、辅助模型或微调目标模型本身，这可能导致大量的计算成本或损害通用性。

Method: 将token级生成过程建模为马尔可夫链，并定义一个价值函数来估计给定任何隐藏状态的预期输出质量。

Result: 在文本和多模态任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在难度估计方面始终优于现有的基线方法。此外，将难度估计应用于指导自适应推理策略，包括Self-Consistency、Best-of-N和Self-Refine，以更少的生成token实现了更高的推理效率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅基于初始隐藏状态进行高效和准确的难度估计，并在自适应推理策略中实现更高的推理效率。

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing

this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

*Caiqi Zhang,Chang Shu,Ehsan Shareghi,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的、无需训练的、基于图的置信度估计方法，专门用于解决大型语言模型在推理任务中的置信度估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的置信度估计方法主要针对事实问答任务，无法很好地泛化到推理任务。

Method: 该方法将推理路径建模为有向图，并通过利用图的属性（如中心性、路径收敛和路径权重）来估计置信度。

Result: 在三个推理数据集上，使用两个大型语言模型进行的实验表明，该方法提高了置信度估计，并增强了在两个下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的置信度估计方法，可以提高大型语言模型在推理任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

*Yuval Weiss,David Demitri Africa,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoRA 在小型语言模型上的预训练效果不如标准训练，并且会加剧模型中的秩缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 ReLoRA 在小型语言模型预训练中的效果，因为小型语言模型计算和环境成本更低。

Method: 通过消融实验评估 ReLoRA 在 11M-66M 参数的小型语言模型上的性能和学习动态。

Result: ReLoRA 在损失、Paloma 困惑度和 BLiMP 上的表现通常比标准训练差，并且模型越大差距越大。ReLoRA 还会加剧小型模型中发现的秩缺陷。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能不容易转移到小型语言模型的预训练中，需要在低计算状态下进行更多研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

*Chenye Zou,Xingyue Wen,Tianyi Hu,Qian Janice Wang,Daniel Hershcovich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖的问题，即在中文和英文之间调整葡萄酒评论，它超越了字面翻译，通过结合区域口味偏好和特定于文化的风味描述符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的最新进展为文化相关的语言任务打开了大门。

Method: 在跨文化葡萄酒评论改编的案例研究中，我们编制了第一个专业的平行评论语料库，其中包含 8k 中文和 16k 英语评论。我们使用自动指标和人工评估来衡量神经机器翻译基线和最先进的 LLM。

Result: 我们的分析表明，当前的模型难以捕捉文化细微差别，尤其是在翻译不同文化之间的葡萄酒描述时。

Conclusion: 这突出了翻译模型在处理文化内容方面的挑战和局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 SitLLM 的轻量级多模态框架，该框架集成了灵活的压力传感与大型语言模型 (LLM)，以实现细粒度的姿势理解和个性化的健康导向型响应生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不良坐姿是导致长期肌肉骨骼疾病和生理功能障碍的一个关键但经常被忽视的因素。现有的坐姿监测系统虽然利用视觉、IMU 或基于压力的方式，但通常存在粗粒度识别的问题，并且缺乏个性化反馈所需的语义表达能力。

Method: SitLLM 包含三个关键组件：(1) 高斯鲁棒传感器嵌入模块，该模块将压力图划分为空间补丁，并注入局部噪声扰动以实现鲁棒的特征提取；(2) 提示驱动的跨模态对齐模块，该模块通过使用预训练的词汇嵌入的多头交叉注意将传感器嵌入重新编程到 LLM 的语义空间中；(3) 多上下文提示模块，该模块融合了特征级、结构级、统计级和语义级上下文信息，以指导指令理解。

Result: 未提供。

Conclusion: 未提供。

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域特定训练数据的稀缺性和复杂性限制了大型语言模型在专业领域的应用。

Method: 使用大型语言模型作为一次性教师，通过多模型生成（GPT-4o和o3-mini）将32亿个AIS船舶跟踪记录转换为21,543个合成问答对，然后对Qwen2.5-7B模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-7B模型在海事任务上实现了75%的准确率，同时比使用更大的模型进行推理便宜得多。

Conclusion: 小型、廉价的模型在经过适当的微调后，可以提供与大型模型相似的准确性，而且成本更低。该方法为专业人工智能应用的合成数据集生成领域做出了贡献，并为人工标注不可行的领域提供了一个高度可重复的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的奖励塑造方法，使用小型编码器Transformer作为语义奖励模型，以提高大型语言模型生成解释的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习技术依赖于速度慢且成本高的LLM评估或脆弱的基于关键词的指标，这些指标无法捕捉高质量解释的语义本质。

Method: 在Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) 框架内，使用小型高效的编码器Transformer作为语义奖励模型，该模型基于生成解释和ground-truth参考之间的余弦相似性提供密集的、语义丰富的奖励信号。

Result: 在意大利医学院入学考试任务中，GRPO与提出的语义奖励相比强大的SFT基线，显著提高了模型解释的忠实度和清晰度。

Conclusion: 使用轻量级编码器模型进行复杂生成任务中的细致奖励塑造具有强大的潜力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

TL;DR: PLAP: A planning framework that grounds LLM-based agents in complex environments by using a skill library, a skill planner, and a skill executor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with grounding in complex environments due to unreliable action generation or reliance on expert experience.

Method: Introduces the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) framework, which includes a skill library, an LLM-powered skill planner, and a skill executor.

Result: PLAP, driven by GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting, outperforms 80% of baselines in MicroRTS. Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP surpasses a top-tier scripted agent with few-shot examples. An LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability is released.

Conclusion: PLAP effectively facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments. The paper also releases an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

*Jinxin Li,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Junjie Hu,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 幻觉是大型语言模型部署的关键障碍。本文提出了一种新的幻觉检测框架，通过建模自回归生成过程中隐藏表征的时间动态性来检测幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检测方法主要分为两类：事实性检查和静态隐藏状态分析。事实性检查受限于外部知识覆盖，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差，导致其有效性和鲁棒性有限。

Method: 该方法通过在层中采样激活来构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换（FFT）获得频域表示，并提取最强的非DC频率分量作为频谱特征。此外，通过利用LLM的自回归特性，该方法识别出用于有效和可靠检测的最佳观察点。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法比现有技术水平的方法提高了10个百分点以上。

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，该方法为LLM中强大的幻觉检测建立了一个新的范例。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 过多的prompt示例会导致大语言模型(LLM)性能下降，这与上下文少样本学习的传统认知相悖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究过prompt现象中少样本学习的困境，即过多的prompt示例反而降低LLM的性能。

Method: 利用三种标准的少样本选择方法（随机抽样、语义嵌入和TF-IDF向量）构建prompt框架，并在多个LLM上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，在prompt中加入过多的领域特定示例可能会降低某些LLM的性能，这与先前认为更多相关少样本示例普遍有益于LLM的经验结论相矛盾。通过逐步增加TF-IDF选择和分层的少样本示例的数量，确定每个LLM的最佳数量，从而避免过度prompt问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在对功能和非功能需求进行分类时，以更少的示例实现了卓越的性能，超过了当前技术水平1%。

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地应用于需要细致的心理理解的角色，但它们在解释人类性格特征方面的能力仍未被探索。

Method: 本文构建了一个新的基准，包括半结构化访谈记录和经过验证的连续大五人格特质评分，并使用该数据集系统地评估了llm在三种范式下的性能。

Result: 所有模型预测与真实性格特质之间的皮尔逊相关系数均低于0.26，表明当前llm与经过验证的心理结构的一致性有限。

Conclusion: 将llm与复杂的人类属性对齐仍然面临挑战，未来的工作应该关注特定于特质的提示、上下文感知建模和面向对齐的微调。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在图表问题回答(CQA)任务中取得了进展，但当模型关注图表中不相关的区域时，任务仍然具有挑战性。通过系统地比较人和模型的注意力，发现LVLMs经常与人类的注视不同，导致可解释性和准确性降低。

Method: 本文提出了一种注视引导的注意力细化方法，使图像-文本注意力与人类的注视对齐。

Result: 该方法提高了答案的准确性和注意力对齐，在多个模型上产生了高达2.56个百分点的收益。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，结合人类注视可以提高以图表为中心的lvlm的推理质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 post-training 方法在 agentic 任务中表现不佳，尤其是在开源实现中。原因是缺乏强大的 agentic 基础模型，导致模型在 post-training 期间需要同时学习各种 agentic 行为并将其与专家演示对齐，从而产生根本的优化张力。

Method: 本文提出将 Agentic CPT 纳入深度研究 agents 训练流程，并基于此方法开发了一个名为 AgentFounder 的深度研究 agent 模型。

Result: 在 10 个 benchmarks 上的评估结果表明，AgentFounder-30B 达到了 state-of-the-art 的性能，同时保持了强大的工具使用能力，例如在 BrowseComp-en 上达到 39.9%，在 BrowseComp-zh 上达到 43.3%，在 HLE 上达到 31.5% Pass@1。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 Agentic CPT 方法能够有效提升 agentic 模型的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

Motivation: 现实世界API的多样性需要精确和强大的函数调用智能，这需要agents在不同的环境中通过交互来发展这些能力。函数调用能力的广度与agents接受训练的环境的多样性密切相关。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的框架，自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，系统地扩展函数调用场景的空间。采用了一种两阶段agent微调策略：首先赋予agents基本的智能能力，然后针对特定领域进行专业化。

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language

these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双代理框架WebWeaver，用于解决开放式深度研究（OEDR）中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法存在静态研究流程和一次性生成范例的局限性，容易出现长上下文失败的问题。

Method: WebWeaver通过动态循环交错证据获取和优化，生成全面的、基于来源的大纲，并使用分层检索和写作过程，按部分撰写报告。

Result: WebWeaver在主要的OEDR基准测试中取得了新的state-of-the-art成果。

Conclusion: 自适应规划和重点综合对于生成高质量、可靠和结构良好的报告至关重要。

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum通过定期总结上下文来解决LLM web agent在处理复杂查询时因上下文窗口限制而导致的问题，并通过ReSum-GRPO进行优化，实验表明ReSum优于ReAct。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM web agent在知识密集型任务中表现出色，但受限于上下文窗口。复杂查询需要大量的搜索循环，快速耗尽上下文预算。

Method: 提出ReSum范式，通过定期上下文总结将交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态。提出ReSum-GRPO，将GRPO与分段轨迹训练和优势广播相结合。

Result: ReSum比ReAct平均提升4.5%，ReSum-GRPO训练后提升高达8.2%。WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%。

Conclusion: ReSum能有效提高LLM web agent在复杂查询中的性能，并超越现有的开源web agent。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

### [45] [Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13316)
*Millicent Li,Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo,Giordano Rogers,Naomi Saphra,Byron C. Wallace*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，用大型语言模型将另一个大型语言模型的内部表征翻译成自然语言描述的方法，可能仅仅反映了输入信息或翻译模型的参数知识，而不是目标模型的内部运作方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究激活 verbalization 方法是否真正提供了关于目标模型内部运作的特权知识，或者它们仅仅传达了关于其输入的信息。

Method: 通过在先前工作中使用的数据集上评估流行的 verbalization 方法，并在没有访问目标模型内部的情况下进行基准测试，以及运行受控实验。

Result: 发现这些方法在没有访问目标模型内部的情况下也能成功完成基准测试，表明这些数据集不适合评估 verbalization 方法。受控实验表明，verbalization 结果通常反映了生成它们的 verbalizer LLM 的参数知识，而不是被解码的目标 LLM 的激活。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要有针对性的基准和实验控制，以严格评估 verbalization 方法是否能为大型语言模型的运作提供有意义的见解。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的机器学习方法，以提高 3D 解剖重建算法的泛化能力，超越了乳腺癌的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在分割不同数据集的解剖结构时难以泛化。

Method: 使用 U-Mamba 和人机协作方法改进分割，并使用 Dice 相似系数评估自动分割和真实值之间的重叠程度。

Result: U-Mamba 在 T1 加权图像上显示出强大的性能，对于整个器官的 DSC 值为 0.97 (±0.013)，对于纤维腺组织的 DSC 值为 0.96 (±0.024)，对于肿瘤的 DSC 值为 0.82 (±0.12)。

Conclusion: 这种人机协作机器学习方法成功地推广了用于 3D 重建和解剖分割的算法，跨越了患者数据集，为临床医生提供增强的可视化，改进术前计划，并提供更有效的患者教育。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络(CNNs)自动分割TRISO燃料颗粒的横截面图像，以减少手动分析的工作量和主观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工分析TRISO燃料颗粒的辐照后显微图像以获取统计信息既繁琐又主观。

Method: 使用包含2000多张显微图像的TRISO数据集，训练了RU-Net（本文开发）、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN模型。

Result: RU-Net模型在交并比(IoU)方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 使用CNN模型可以加快TRISO颗粒横截面的分析，显著减少手动工作量并提高分割结果的客观性。

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活的分层管道，用于异常检测和状态估计（鲜重、干重和组织养分）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的养分管理方法需要耗时的分析，阻碍了实时优化。成像技术虽然促进了快速表型分析，但计算密集，无法在资源受限的情况下部署。

Method: 使用多光谱成像(MSI)，开发了一个使用自编码器(AE)进行早期预警的分层管道。比较了两种不同复杂度的状态估计模块：植被指数(VI)特征与机器学习(随机森林，RF)和原始全图像深度学习(Vision Transformer，ViT)。

Result: 结果表明，高效的异常检测(移植后9天，T3样本的净检测率为73%)，且能量远低于浪费的氮中的隐含能量。ViT在磷和钙的估计上优于RF(R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35)，但能量成本更高。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过模块化管道，为边缘诊断和农业可持续性的实际机会开辟了机会。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

Motivation: 评估大型多模态模型理解多模态幽默和识别叙事序列的能力，因为这是社交智能的核心方面，但对LMMs来说仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个带注释的多格漫画，用于评估LMMs。

Result: 现有最佳模型在面板排序任务中仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类水平，揭示了当前模型在整合视觉和文本线索以实现连贯叙事和幽默理解方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: PixelHumor旨在通过提供一个严格的框架来评估多模态上下文和叙事推理，从而推动LMMs的发展，使其更好地参与自然的、具有社会意识的互动。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

Motivation: 现有的HOI方法在离线环境下表现良好，但在在线环境下表现较差。现实世界的场景需要在在线环境下进行HOI感知和生成。

Method: 提出了OnlineHOI框架，该框架基于Mamba架构，并采用记忆机制，可以有效整合历史信息。

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及online HOI4D感知任务上，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的OnlineHOI框架在在线HOI感知和生成任务上表现出色，证明了Mamba架构和记忆机制的有效性。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human

However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal

*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏差(SB)与其在图像分类任务中的性能之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的简单性偏差(SB)是其泛化能力的关键因素。 近期研究表明，过度的SB可能会损害复杂任务的性能，并且这种偏差的需求因任务而异。 许多研究都集中在简单的模型或合成任务上。 在大型模型中衡量SB仍然具有挑战性，并且对于SB与各种图像分类任务的相关性知之甚少。

Method: 1. 从理论上分析了现有复杂性度量的潜在局限性，并提出了一个频率感知的度量，以捕获更细粒度的SB差异。 2. 验证了该度量在经过两种最新SB调制方法处理的CLIP模型上，证明它比以前的度量更具信息性和一致性。 3. 检查了这些模型的SB与其在一系列图像分类任务中的性能之间的关系，包括零样本和微调设置。

Result: 1. 提出的频率感知度量比以前的度量更具信息性和一致性。 2. 更强的SB与OOD泛化性能更好相关，而不是与对抗鲁棒性相关。

Conclusion: 将模型的归纳偏差与目标任务的特征对齐是有益的。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

TL;DR: GraphDerm: A population-graph framework fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for dermoscopic classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-only AI often ignores patient metadata and the physical scale needed for geometric analysis.

Method: Curation of ISIC 2018/2019, synthesis of ruler-embedded images, training U-Nets for segmentation, regression of pixels-per-millimeter, computation of real-scale descriptors, and a spectral GNN for semi-supervised node classification.

Result: Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812.

Conclusion: Scale-aware, graph-based AI yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines and is a promising direction for dermoscopic decision support.

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像机器翻译（TIMT）研究主要集中于为图像中的所有文本提供翻译，而忽略了提供边界框和覆盖有限的场景。

Method: 提出了自适应图像OCR优化流程，该流程基于场景自适应地选择合适的OCR工具，并优化文本丰富的图像的结果。构建了PATIMT基准测试（PATIMTBench），其中包含10个不同的真实世界场景。构建了一个测试集，其中包含1,200个高质量实例，这些实例由人工专家手动注释和审核。

Result: 紧凑的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在我们的数据上进行微调后，在两个子任务上都实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果还突出了我们训练数据的可扩展性和通用性。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 SimMemDA 的框架，用于无监督域自适应船舶尾流检测，通过实例级特征相似性过滤和特征记忆引导来解决 SAR 图像和光学图像之间的跨模态域适应挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于 SAR 图像的成像机制复杂，尾流特征抽象且噪声大，难以准确标注。光学图像虽然视觉线索更清晰，但模型在 SAR 图像上表现不佳，存在域偏移问题。

Method: 1) 使用 WakeGAN 对光学图像进行风格迁移，生成接近 SAR 风格的伪图像。2) 设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制，识别和优先选择具有目标域分布的源域样本，减少负迁移。3) 引入特征置信度记忆库，结合 K 近邻置信度加权融合策略，动态校准目标域中的伪标签。4) 通过区域混合训练进一步增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的 SimMemDA 方法可以提高跨模态船舶尾流检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 验证了该方法的有效性和可行性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动、物理引导的深度学习方法，用于生成美国大陆地区 2 公里分辨率的逐小时气温数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象站和卫星数据在时空覆盖上存在局限性，无法提供无缝数据。

Method: 该方法名为 Amplifier Air-Transformer，首先重建被云层遮挡的 GOES-16 地表温度数据，然后利用神经网络将其转换为气温，并通过深度集成学习提高可靠性。

Result: 在美国大陆地区（2018-2024）的 777 亿地表温度像素和 1.55 亿气象站气温记录上进行了测试，基于站点的验证实现了 1.93 摄氏度的逐小时气温映射精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测，可以扩展到其他卫星源，以实现高时空分辨率的无缝气温监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

*Mattia Soldan,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Bernard Ghanem,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ResidualViT，通过利用视频中的时间冗余来高效计算时间密集帧级别特征，同时保持与原始基础模型相近的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多视频理解任务需要对高时间分辨率采样的帧进行“时间密集”推理，但计算帧级别特征的成本很高。

Method: 1. 引入ResidualViT架构，利用可学习残差连接确保连续帧之间的时间一致性，并使用token reduction模块选择性地丢弃时间冗余信息。2. 提出轻量级蒸馏策略，以近似原始基础模型的帧级别特征。

Result: 在四个任务和五个数据集上评估，计算成本显著降低（高达60%），推理速度提高（高达2.5倍），同时保持与原始基础模型相近的精度。

Conclusion: ResidualViT架构可以在显著降低计算成本和提高推理速度的同时，保持与原始基础模型相近的精度。

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

Motivation: 研究动机是提高动物重识别的准确率。

Method: 使用了 DINOv2 和 MegaDescriptor 作为 backbone，并结合 K 近邻分类器和 triplet-learning 投影头。

Result: 领域特定的 MegaDescriptor 模型通过 triplet-learning 提升了 0.13 个点，而通用模型 DINOv2 几乎没有提升。

Conclusion: 通用特征难以针对特定任务进行优化，领域特定的预训练至关重要。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在各种任务中取得了显著的成功，但它们的计算需求通常使其不适合在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: 我们专注于移动应用程序的最先进架构 GhostNetV3，并提出了 GhostNetV3-Small，这是一种修改后的变体，旨在在 CIFAR-10 数据集中等低分辨率输入上表现更好。除了架构调整外，我们还提供了知识蒸馏技术的比较评估，包括传统知识蒸馏、教师助理和教师集成。

Result: 实验结果表明，GhostNetV3-Small 在 CIFAR-10 上的性能明显优于原始 GhostNetV3，达到了 93.94% 的准确率。与预期相反，所有检查的蒸馏策略都导致准确率低于基线训练。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，在小规模图像分类任务中，架构调整可能比蒸馏更有效，突出了需要进一步研究有效模型设计和用于低分辨率域的先进蒸馏技术。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Conclusion: 这些发现为基于无人机的生物多样性和保护监测提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Result: DYNAMO优于强大的基线，在不同的齿轮配置中实现了准确且时间上一致的预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于在CAD装配中对耦合机械运动进行数据驱动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Motivation: Accurate cotton boll recognition is crucial for automating harvesting, yield estimation, and breeding research, but current harvesting is labor-intensive and inefficient.

Method: The paper proposes Cott-ADNet, which builds on YOLOv11n and incorporates a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism and a Dilated Receptive Field SPPF.

Result: Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8% Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet is an accurate and efficient solution for in-field deployment, providing a basis for automated cotton harvesting and phenotypic analysis. The code and dataset are available online.

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的tokenizer训练方案可以有效提高生成模型的图像生成质量和收敛速度。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个用于4D单芯片雷达的基础模型，该模型可以预测3D occupancy和语义分割，其质量通常只有使用更高分辨率的传感器才有可能实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达具有紧凑、廉价和耐用的优点，但角分辨率较差。虽然已经有人提出了基于学习的方法来缓解这一缺点，但还没有出现用于毫米波雷达的标准化基础模型或大型数据集，从业者主要使用相对较小的数据集从头开始训练特定任务的模型。

Method: 本文收集了目前最大的原始雷达数据集，包含100万个样本（29小时），并训练了一个名为GRT的基础模型。

Result: GRT在不同的设置中具有良好的泛化能力，可以针对不同的任务进行微调，并显示出对数数据缩放的特性。使用原始雷达数据明显优于广泛使用的有损表示，相当于训练数据增加了10倍。

Conclusion: 为了充分发挥GRT的潜力，大约需要1亿个样本（3000小时）的数据。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

Result: 实验结果表明：ground-truth captions 的描述性显著影响模型性能；更大的模型（如LLaVA）在语义理解方面表现出色，但并非普遍优于较小的模型；某些噪声类型（如JPEG压缩和运动模糊）会显著降低所有模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了模型大小、数据集特征和噪声鲁棒性之间的微妙权衡，并为未来鲁棒的多模态学习提供了一个标准化的基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的弱监督语义分割方法，该方法利用实例级别的线索和影响函数来生成高质量、边界感知的定位图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督语义分割方法在精确的对象边界定位方面存在困难，并且通常只关注最具区分性的区域。

Method: 该方法引入了三个关键创新：(1) 实例引导的细化，使用真实分割掩码来指导 CAM 生成，确保完整的对象覆盖；(2) 影响函数整合，捕捉训练样本和模型预测之间的关系；(3) 多尺度边界增强，采用渐进式细化策略来实现清晰、精确的对象边界。

Result: IG-CAM 在 PASCAL VOC 2012 数据集上取得了最先进的性能，mIoU 在后处理前为 82.3%，在应用条件随机场 (CRF) 细化后进一步提高到 86.6%。

Conclusion: IG-CAM 成为弱监督语义分割的新基准，为像素级注释不可用或成本过高的场景提供了一个实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且可靠的解决方案，以支持育种和农艺研究中的高通量表型分析。

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

*Can Peng,Yuyuan Liu,Yingyu Yang,Pramit Saha,Qianye Yang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对联邦学习(FL)中多标签数据场景下，由于数据分散和异构性导致的深度学习性能下降问题，提出了一个基于神经崩溃(NC)理论的方法，通过特征解耦和共享NC结构对齐特征分布，提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习研究主要集中在单标签分类上，而现实世界中多标签场景更为常见，尤其是在医疗图像等领域。多标签数据具有标签共现、标签间依赖以及局部和全局标签关系差异等复杂特征，给联邦学习带来了挑战。

Method: 提出了一种特征解耦模块，用于提取语义特定的特征。利用预定义的共享NC结构来引导这些解耦的类特征的聚类，从而缓解由于不同的局部数据分布导致的客户端模型之间的潜在冲突。此外，还设计了正则化损失，以鼓励潜在特征空间中的紧凑聚类。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上进行的实验表明，该方法在八个不同的设置中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了其在具有挑战性的联邦学习场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

TL;DR: 提出 Agent4FaceForgery 框架，以解决人脸伪造检测中离线基准与实际效果之间差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练数据缺乏生态有效性，无法捕捉人类伪造的多样意图和迭代过程，以及社交媒体中复杂的文本-图像交互。

Method: 构建一个多智能体框架，其中由 LLM 驱动的智能体模拟伪造创建过程，并在模拟的社交环境中交互，生成带有细微文本-图像一致性标签的样本。采用自适应拒绝采样机制确保数据质量和多样性。

Result: 实验验证表明，通过模拟驱动方法生成的数据为多种架构的检测器带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效且有价值。

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

*Wenxuan Ji,Haichao Shi,Xiao-Yu zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模图网络建模（MGNM）的方法，利用GNN的 relational structure 来增强 HOI 检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型不能显式地建模 HOI 检测中固有的关系结构，这阻碍了交互的识别。而 GNN 更适合这个任务，因为它们显式地建模了人-物对之间的关系。

Method: 设计了一个多模图网络框架，在四阶段图结构中显式地建模 HOI 任务。引入了一种多层次特征交互机制，利用多层次视觉和语言特征来加强人-物对之间的信息传播。

Result: MGNM 在 HICO-DET 和 V-COCO 两个 benchmark 上实现了 SOTA 性能。当与更高级的目标检测器集成时，该方法表现出显著的性能提升，并在 rare 类和 non-rare 类之间保持了有效的平衡。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 MGNM 方法有效地利用 GNN 提升了 HOI 检测的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于 VQVAE 和 ViT 架构的照明估计框架 (VQT-Light)，该框架可以预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图，同时保持轻量级和快速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么难以恢复光照图的详细纹理，要么在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战。

Method: 该框架包括两个模块：特征提取和光照估计。首先，利用 VQVAE 提取光照图的离散特征而不是连续特征，以避免“后验崩塌”。其次，通过 ViT 而不是 CNN 来捕获输入图像的全局上下文和依赖关系，以提高视场外光照的预测。

Result: VQT-Light 实现了 40FPS 的推理速度，并提高了多个评估指标。与现有的最先进方法相比，该方法实现了卓越的结果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的照明估计框架，该框架可以预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图，同时保持轻量级和快速。

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在各种一致性蒸馏方法中，生成性能均得到显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法具有很强的适应性，并在复杂生成场景中扩展了一致性蒸馏模型的适用性。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Motivation: 深度学习模型容易受到对抗攻击，这对自动驾驶汽车的定位构成严重安全挑战，但针对激光雷达定位的攻击研究较少。

Method: 逆向工程定位模型，识别关键点并策略性地移除它们。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，移除包含Top-K关键点的区域会显著降低配准精度。在Autoware自动驾驶平台上，隐藏少量关键区域会导致明显的定位漂移。使用近红外吸收材料隐藏关键区域，成功在物理世界中复制了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该研究更接近真实的物理世界攻击，证明了所提方案的真实性和通用性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Conclusion: 该方法具有优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有ARD方法在提高学生模型鲁棒性的同时，会降低其在干净样本上的性能。作者认为这是由于双教师模型优化目标不一致，以及迭代生成的对抗样本导致鲁棒教师模型性能下降所致。

Method: 本文提出了CIARD方法，包含两个关键创新：1. 采用多教师框架和对比推损对齐，以解决双教师优化目标中的冲突；2. 采用持续对抗性重训练，以保持动态教师鲁棒性，防止其性能因变化的对抗样本而下降。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上的大量实验表明，CIARD在各种攻击场景下的对抗防御率平均提高了3.53，干净样本准确率提高了5.87，为平衡模型鲁棒性和泛化性建立了一个新的基准。

Conclusion: CIARD方法能够有效提高模型在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，同时保持在干净样本上的高性能。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Motivation: 现有的基准测试数据集在跨模态对齐方面存在缺陷，不能很好地反映真实世界的篡改模式。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架的检测精度显著优于现有方法，在SAMM数据集上实现了2.06%的提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法和数据集能够有效地检测和定位多模态数据中经过语义协调的篡改内容。

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了空间和语义信息，且难以提取区分性特征，导致跨视角地理定位任务具有挑战性。

Method: 该方法包括多频率分支块(MFB)和频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块。 MFB块捕获低频结构特征和高频边缘细节，FSA模块关注频率特征的关键区域。

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明MFAF方法在无人机定位和无人机导航任务中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: MFAF方法可以有效提高跨视角地理定位的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像质量差且AUV计算资源有限，需要评估YOLO系列模型在水下环境中的表现。

Method: 在两个自建的水下图像数据集上，使用不同比例的训练数据训练YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, 和 YOLOv11-s，并使用相同的超参数进行训练。

Result: YOLOv9 之后精度提升不明显，但推理速度显著提高。YOLOv10 在速度和精度之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: YOLOv10 是嵌入式 AUV 部署的最佳选择，并提供了一个开放的基准和代码库以加速未来的海洋视觉研究。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for

as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为 SmokeBench 的真实场景监控图像去烟雾基准数据集，该数据集包含在不同场景设置和烟雾浓度下捕获的图像对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期火灾场景（点燃后 0-15 分钟）是紧急干预的关键时间窗口。在此阶段，燃烧产生的烟雾会显着降低监控系统的可见性，严重损害态势感知并阻碍有效的应急响应和救援行动。因此，迫切需要从图像中去除烟雾以获得清晰的场景信息。然而，由于缺乏包含成对的无烟和烟雾退化图像的大规模真实数据集，烟雾去除算法的开发仍然受到限制。

Method: 构建了一个名为 SmokeBench 的真实场景监控图像去烟雾基准数据集，其中包含在不同场景设置和烟雾浓度下捕获的图像对。该数据集提供精确对齐的退化和干净图像，从而实现监督学习和严格评估。

Result: 通过在数据集上对各种去烟雾方法进行基准测试，进行了全面的实验。该数据集为推进真实火灾场景中稳健而实用的图像去烟雾技术奠定了宝贵的基础。

Conclusion: 发布了一个真实场景监控图像去烟雾基准数据集 SmokeBench，为推进真实火灾场景中稳健而实用的图像去烟雾技术奠定了宝贵的基础。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的红外和可见图像融合框架RIS-FUSION，该框架通过联合优化融合和指代图像分割来提升融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏目标对齐的任务来监督和评估文本对融合结果的贡献。

Method: 提出了一个级联框架，通过LangGatedFusion模块将文本特征注入融合主干，以增强语义对齐。

Result: RIS-FUSION取得了state-of-the-art的性能，mIoU超过现有方法11%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的RIS-FUSION框架有效提升了文本驱动的红外和可见图像融合效果。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的组合零样本学习方法，通过解耦和重构特征来增强数据，并结合去偏策略，以提高模型在组合泛化方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在组合零样本学习中，由于属性和对象的纠缠以及长尾分布的普遍存在，学习可泛化的组合表示仍然具有挑战性。受到神经科学关于想象和感知共享相似神经过程的发现的启发。

Method: 提出了一种名为Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) 的新方法，该方法集成了用于特征增强的解耦和重构框架与去偏策略。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行的大量实验表明，DeFA 在封闭世界和开放世界设置中都取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeFA 显式地利用了已见属性和对象的先验知识，通过合成高保真组合特征来支持组合泛化。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)通过扩展架构和广泛的训练，在多模态任务上表现出了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，现有的混合专家(MoE)方法由于视觉和语言处理之间的不对称性而面临挑战。视觉信息在空间上是完整的，而语言需要保持连续的上下文。

Method: 我们设计了用于模态特定处理的模态内专家，用于分层跨模态交互的双曲跨模态专家，以及用于抑制参数偏差和保持上下文基础的证据优先语言专家。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，与vanilla MoE和模态特定MoE相比，AsyMoE分别实现了26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，并且比密集模型减少了25.45%的激活参数。

Conclusion: 我们提出了AsyMoE，它使用三个专门的专家组来模拟这种不对称性:模态内专家，双曲跨模态专家，以及证据优先语言专家。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Motivation: 大多数现有的空间推理基准测试都侧重于静态或全局可观察的环境，无法捕捉到在部分可观察和动态变化下的长期推理和记忆利用的挑战。

Method: 我们引入了两个动态空间基准，局部可观察的迷宫导航和match-2消除，当局部感知、环境反馈和全局目标紧密结合时，可以系统地评估模型在空间理解和自适应规划方面的能力。我们进一步提出了一种基于主观经验的记忆机制，用于跨任务的经验转移和验证。

Conclusion: 我们的基准测试为未来的方法学进步提供了一个全面的平台。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的单视图3D生成模型SPGen，该模型通过将几何信息投影到边界球体上并解包成紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影（SP）表示来编码几何信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视图3D生成模型容易出现视图间不一致，并且无法忠实地表示复杂的内部结构或非平凡的拓扑结构。

Method: 该方法通过将几何信息投影到边界球体上并解包成紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影（SP）表示来编码几何信息, 并在图像域中操作。

Result: SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面明显优于现有的基线。

Conclusion: SPGen具有一致性、灵活性和效率三大优势，因为它利用单一视角的SP映射消除了视图不一致和歧义，多层SP映射表示嵌套的内部结构并支持直接提升到水密或开放的3D表面，图像域公式允许直接继承强大的2D扩散先验并能够以有限的计算资源进行高效的微调。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型 (VLM) 容易受到越狱攻击，并且现有越狱方法的有效性和效率仍有提升空间。

Method: Defense2Attack 包含三个关键组件：(1) 一个视觉优化器，它嵌入具有肯定和鼓励语义的通用对抗扰动；(2) 一个文本优化器，它使用防御风格的提示来优化输入；(3) 一个红队后缀生成器，通过强化微调来增强越狱效果。

Result: 在四个 VLM 和四个安全基准上的实验结果表明，Defense2Attack 在单次尝试中实现了卓越的越狱性能，优于通常需要多次尝试的最新攻击方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱 VLM 提供了一个新的视角。

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Motivation: 收集动态和多样化的室内环境中高质量的射频数据仍然是一个主要的挑战。

Method: WaveVerse 引入了一个语言引导的 4D 世界生成器，其中包括一个状态感知因果变换器，用于生成以空间约束和文本为条件的人类运动，以及一个相位一致的射线追踪模拟器，可以模拟准确和连贯的射频信号。

Conclusion: WaveVerse 不仅支持射频成像的数据生成，而且在基于机器学习的高分辨率成像和人类活动识别方面始终能够获得性能提升。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法采用不加区分的属性分配，这导致了梯度冲突。

Method: 提出了一种新的密度化策略，该策略在表面重建模块的监督下动态激活球谐函数或法线；开发了一种轻量级高斯表示，该表示基于梯度幅度自适应地调整每个高斯的SH阶数，并执行任务解耦剪枝以移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Result: 该方法在重建质量和效率方面始终优于最先进的方法，以更少的参数实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 该管理方法是模型无关的，可以无缝集成到其他框架中，从而提高性能并减小模型尺寸。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习的滤波器，并验证其可分离性和空间偏移特性。

Method: 1. 计算学习滤波器的空间扩展度量（加权均值和方差）。2. 将聚类后的“主密钥滤波器”建模为应用于空间平滑操作（离散高斯核）的差分算子。3. 通过两种方式拟合模型：(i) 坐标方向上尺度参数不同；(ii) 坐标方向上尺度参数相同。4. 通过约束空间方差相等或最小化 l1/l2 范数来进行模型拟合。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习的滤波器可以很好地用离散尺度空间滤波器来近似。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

Motivation: 探讨多模态LLM如何利用人类相关的概念（如图像风格或构图）来进行图像质量评估，并深入了解图像的哪些属性对LLM和人类的判断至关重要。

Method: 1. 构建合成图像对的人类偏好数据集。2. 使用图像质量属性对之间的互任务相关性，理解人类判断中哪些属性相关。3. 对LLM重复相同的分析，比较人类和LLM在图像质量属性关系上的差异。4. 通过生成在每个轴上具有高度控制的合成数据集，研究各个图像质量属性。

Result: 发现LLM在图像质量属性之间的关系比人类弱得多，并且某些属性（如解剖学准确性）对于多模态LLM来说更难判断。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了人类和多模态LLM在感知图像方面存在的有趣差异。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法易受特征噪声影响，缺乏纠错机制。

Method: 提出Recurrent Cross-view Object geo-localization Transformer (ReCOT)，通过学习token和循环注意力机制迭代优化预测位置，并引入SAM知识蒸馏和参考特征增强模块。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中，ReCOT取得了state-of-the-art (SOTA) 性能，并且参数比以前的SOTA方法减少了60%。

Conclusion: ReCOT有效地提高了跨视角对象地理定位的性能，并在参数效率方面有所提升。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线流程，耗时较长，且易受相机姿态、DSM和遮挡等因素影响，导致质量下降。

Method: 通过On-the-Fly SfM计算图像姿态和稀疏点云，将新的高斯函数积分并优化到之前未见或粗略重建的区域，结合正交splatting进行渲染。

Result: 实验表明，A-TDOM能够以近实时的方式主动渲染TDOM，每张新图像的3DGS优化在几秒内完成，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和TDOM几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法能够在保证渲染质量和几何精度的前提下，实现近实时TDOM的生成。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Motivation: 医学图像分割面临多尺度病变变异性、组织边界不清晰和计算密集型处理需求等挑战。

Method: 该模型融合全局和局部特征，并采用动态上采样机制。创新性地设计了混合特征提取模块（SHDCBlock）和动态自适应上采样模块（DyFusionUp）。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，DyGLNet优于现有方法，尤其是在边界精度和小目标分割方面表现出色。同时，它具有较低的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: DyGLNet为临床医学图像分析提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于列车重新规划和重新调度的通用问题定义和文件格式DISPLIB，以促进算法的比较和复现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有列车重新规划和重新调度优化算法研究缺乏通用性和可比性，代码和数据很少公开分享，阻碍了研究的复现和性能评估。

Method: 提出了一个通用的问题定义和文件格式DISPLIB，并收集了来自多个真实用例的问题实例。

Result: 提供了一个参考求解器实现，并公开了所有材料。

Conclusion: DISPLIB的提出允许研究人员在没有工业连接的情况下研究列车调度问题，并使研究界能够对求解器进行实证比较。

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

### [100] [InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263)
*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型多模态模型(LMMs)将训练中观察到的普遍物理定律编码为参数知识，但当推理场景违反这些物理定律时，它们的能力不足。本文提出了InPhyRe，这是一个新的视觉问答基准，用于评估LMMs的归纳物理推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基准仅评估LMMs中的参数知识，而忽略了归纳物理推理能力。为了使LMMs能够在安全关键应用中取代人类，需要评估和提高它们的归纳物理推理能力。

Method: 提出了InPhyRe基准，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频来评估LMMs预测碰撞事件结果的能力。

Result: 通过对13个LMMs的评估，发现LMMs难以应用其有限的参数知识进行推理，当演示样本违反普遍物理定律时，归纳物理推理能力较弱，并且存在语言偏差，很大程度上忽略了视觉输入。

Conclusion: LMMs在归纳物理推理方面存在不足，尤其是在违反常见物理定律的情况下，并且对视觉输入的信任度存在问题。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM辅助路线规划系统（LLMAP），该系统结合了LLM作为解析器和多步图构建迭代搜索（MSGS）算法，以优化路线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究的两种方法：LLM-as-Agent直接路线规划难以处理大量地图数据，而基于图的搜索策略在理解自然语言偏好方面能力有限。此外，用户在全球范围内高度异构和不可预测的时空分布带来了更严峻的挑战。

Method: LLMAP系统采用LLM作为解析器来理解自然语言，识别任务，提取用户偏好并识别任务依赖性，结合多步图构建迭代搜索（MSGS）算法作为底层求解器以找到最佳路线。多目标优化方法自适应地调整目标权重，以最大限度地提高兴趣点（POI）质量和任务完成率，同时最大限度地缩短路线距离，但受到三个关键约束：用户时间限制，POI开放时间和任务依赖性。

Result: 在世界范围内14个国家和27个城市中，使用1,000个具有不同复杂性的路线提示进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，该方法在多个约束条件下均能保证卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的LLM辅助路线规划系统，可以有效解决现有方法的局限性，并在实际应用中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Method: 开发了一个基于物联网的平台来更有效地控制植物的环境条件，并使用VGG-19、InceptionResNetV2和InceptionV3算法开发了一个基于人工智能的疾病检测框架。

Result: 物联网系统能够持续向用户发布温度、湿度、水流量和充电箱体积等数据，并调整控制参数以提供最佳的植物生长环境。VGG-19算法能够以最高的92%的准确率识别干旱胁迫和锈病叶片。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将物联网和人工智能技术应用于智能气培温室，实现了环境的有效控制和植物疾病的准确检测。

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

TL;DR: AIssistant是一个旨在简化科研工作流程的人工智能辅助框架，目前处于早期开发阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辅助研究工具分散，缺乏以人为中心的流程。

Method: AIssistant集成了文献合成、分段实验、引文管理和自动LaTeX文本生成等模块化工具和代理，并保持人工监督。

Result: AIssistant提高了起草效率和主题一致性。

Conclusion: 人机协作对于保持事实正确性、方法论合理性和伦理合规性至关重要，AIssistant仍存在幻觉引用、难以适应动态论文结构和多模态内容集成不完整等局限性。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分解方法，用于从用户界面交互轨迹中理解用户意图，该方法首先执行结构化交互摘要，然后利用微调模型进行意图提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能代理开发中，从用户界面交互轨迹中理解用户意图仍然是一个具有挑战性但至关重要的前沿领域。虽然大型多模态语言模型(MLLM)具有处理此类序列复杂性的更大能力，但可以在设备上运行以提供保护隐私、低成本和低延迟用户体验的小型模型，难以准确地进行意图推断。

Method: 该方法首先执行结构化交互摘要，捕获每个用户动作的关键信息。其次，使用在聚合摘要上运行的微调模型执行意图提取。

Result: 该方法提高了资源受限模型中的意图理解能力，甚至超过了大型MLLM的基本性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的分解方法，该方法提高了资源受限模型中的意图理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 \sys 的新框架，通过增强熵来改进大型语言模型在软件工程任务中的性能，并在 SWE-bench 基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在软件工程任务中表现不佳，测试时扩展的增益依赖于模型输出的多样性，而标准对齐方法会降低多样性，且现有偏好优化算法不适用于多轮交互的编码代理。

Method: \sys 框架通过显式保留策略熵来增强偏好目标，并将学习推广到优化多轮交互，并结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法，提出了一种混合最佳轨迹选择方案。

Result: 在 SWE-bench 排行榜上，\sys 框架在开放权重模型中取得了新的最先进的结果，一个 30B 参数模型在 \lite 上排名第一，在 \verified 上排名第四。

Conclusion: \sys 框架有效地提高了大型语言模型在复杂软件工程任务中的性能，并在 SWE-bench 基准测试中取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIWM的紧凑型世界模型，旨在有效捕获鸟瞰图（BEV）表示中的物理交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部署世界模型时，大小和性能之间存在权衡。大型世界模型可以捕获丰富的物理动态，但需要大量的计算资源，这使得它们不适合边缘设备。小型世界模型更容易部署，但通常难以学习准确的物理，导致较差的预测。

Method: PIWM在训练期间使用软掩码来改进动态对象建模和未来预测。还引入了一种简单而有效的技术，即Warm Start，用于推理，以提高零样本模型的预测质量。

Result: 实验表明，在相同的参数规模（400M）下，PIWM的加权总体得分超过基线60.6%。

Conclusion: 即使与最大的基线模型（400M）相比，最小的PIWM（130M Soft Mask）也能以28%更快的推理速度实现7.4%更高的加权总体得分。

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

*Ryan Lucas,Kayhan Behdin,Zhipeng Wang,Qingquan Song,Shao Tang,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 推理语言模型由于其大量的中间推理步骤，部署成本很高。本文提出了一种新的剪枝方法，可以有效压缩模型，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM剪枝方法在推理任务上性能下降明显，甚至可能导致模型变慢。这是因为标准剪枝方法侧重于输入重建，而推理是解码主导的任务。

Method: 提出了一种“推理感知压缩”（RAC）方法，在剪枝过程中同时重建输入和模型的on-policy chain-of-thought traces。

Result: RAC方法可以无缝集成到现有的剪枝工作流程中，并显著提高其性能。

Conclusion: RAC方法是一种有效的压缩推理语言模型的方法，可以在保持性能的同时降低部署成本。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

Motivation: Sample size calculations are critical but complex, creating barriers for researchers.

Method: An AI-powered system integrating large language models with statistical engines was developed and evaluated in a randomized trial.

Result: PowerGPT significantly improved task completion rates, accuracy, and reduced completion time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: PowerGPT enhances accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis and is being deployed across multiple institutions.

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

Motivation: 为了解环岛事故风险模式，从而减少严重事故。

Method: 采用聚类对应分析 (CCA) 识别共现因素，并建立基于树的严重程度模型，用 SHAP 值进行解释。

Result: 结果表明，黑暗、潮湿路面和较高限速与固定物体或角度碰撞事件同时发生时，事故严重程度较高；而在晴朗、低速环境下，事故严重程度较低。特定模式的解释突出了入口（未让行、间隙接受）、多车道环岛内（不当操作）和减速期间（追尾）的机制。

Conclusion: 该工作流程将模式发现与案例级别的解释联系起来，为现场筛选、对策选择和可用于审计的报告提供支持。对信息系统的贡献是为公共安全分析中可用的 XAI 提供了一个实用的模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Abstract: We introduce a novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes
retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically
equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised
data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models:
zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores
in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming
closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models
also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on
out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000
queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from
unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

Motivation: 为了适应多语言受众的广告，不仅需要简单的文本翻译，还需要保持跨不同语言和格式的视觉一致性、空间对齐和风格完整性。

Method: 结合了场景文本检测、修复、机器翻译 (MT) 和文本重构。

Result: 在六个区域的定性结果表明，该方法产生了语义准确且视觉连贯的本地化广告，适用于在实际工作流程中部署。

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生语义准确且视觉连贯的本地化广告，适用于实际工作流程。

Abstract: Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple
text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial
alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We
introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human
oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 Minerva CQ 的 Agentic AI 实时代理辅助产品，旨在通过主动支持代理来改善客户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联络中心的客户体验不佳，主要原因是座席认知负荷过高。现有的 AI 辅助工具通常是被动的，缺乏深层次的上下文推理能力。

Method: Minerva CQ 整合了实时转录、意图和情感检测、实体识别、上下文检索、动态客户画像和局部对话摘要等技术，从而实现主动工作流和持续的上下文构建。

Result: Minerva CQ 在实际生产环境中部署，作为 AI 副驾驶，在多个部署中显著提高了座席效率和客户体验。

Conclusion: Agentic AI 能够主动、实时地支持座席，从而显著提高座席效率和客户体验。

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的SAT求解器框架DaSAThco，该框架通过学习实例特征到定制启发式集成的通用映射，实现了“一次训练，广泛适应”的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SAT求解器依赖于内部启发式算法，但SAT问题的多样性使得单一的最优配置难以实现。以往的自动化方法虽然可以为特定的问题族找到专门的配置，但是这种数据集特定的方法缺乏泛化性，并且对于新的问题类型需要昂贵的重新优化。

Method: 使用大型语言模型，并以系统定义的“问题原型”为指导，生成多样化的专用启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制以形成最终映射。

Result: DaSAThco 实现了卓越的性能，并且表现出强大的领域外泛化能力，而非自适应方法在领域外泛化能力上存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂、可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了一条更具可扩展性和实用性的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的prompt框架，用于金融新闻情感分析，该框架结合了类比推理和思维链（CoT）prompt。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法难以捕捉新闻复杂的经济背景，并且缺乏透明的推理。

Method: 提出了Analogy-Driven Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT)，这是一种prompt框架，它将类比推理与CoT prompt结合起来，用于历史金融新闻的情感预测。AD-FCoT指导LLM在新事件和具有已知结果的相关历史情景之间建立联系，并将这些类比嵌入到结构化的、逐步的推理链中。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验表明，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确率方面优于强大的基线，并且与市场回报的相关性更高。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT生成的解释与领域专业知识相符，为现实世界的金融分析提供了可解释的见解。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多代理框架GBV-SQL，通过SQL2Text反向翻译验证来弥合Text2SQL生成中的语义差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text2SQL模型生成的查询可能在语法上有效，但未能准确捕捉用户意图；当前评估方法受到基准数据集质量差的影响。

Method: 引入Guided Generation with SQL2Text Back-translation Validation机制，使用专门的代理将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言，以验证其与原始问题的逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，GBV-SQL实现了63.23%的执行准确率，提高了5.8%。在去除错误示例后，GBV-SQL在Spider基准测试中实现了96.5% (dev) 和 97.6% (test) 的执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个用于语义验证的鲁棒框架，并强调了基准完整性的重要性，指出需要更严格的数据集管理。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测基于牛群的牛的体重增长可以帮助大型牲畜农场优化饲养策略，做出更明智的育种选择，并降低与气候变化和市场波动相关的风险。

Method: 本文采用随机森林（RF）模型，并将其性能与支持向量回归（SVR）和长短期记忆（LSTM）模型进行比较，以进行月度体重增长预测。

Result: RF模型在所有数据集上的表现均优于SVR和LSTM模型，当同时包含天气和年龄因素时，R^2为0.973，RMSE为0.040，MAE为0.033。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，包括天气和年龄因素可以显著提高体重增长预测的准确性，并且RF模型在所有情况下均优于SVR和LSTM模型。

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的心电图 (ECG) 编码方法 ECG-aBcDe，可以将 ECG 信号转换为任何 LLM 都能理解的通用 ECG 语言，从而实现“构建一次，随处使用”的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在模型特定 ECG 编码器，阻碍了 LLM 之间的迁移；LLM 难以捕捉 ECG 中固有的关键时间尺度信息；黑盒性质限制了临床应用。

Method: 构建了一个 ECG 语言和自然语言的混合数据集，ECG-aBcDe 允许直接微调预训练的 LLM，无需架构修改。ECG 和 ECG 语言之间的双向可转换性允许从 ECG 信号中提取注意力热图，从而显著提高可解释性。ECG-aBcDe 显式地表示时间尺度信息，减轻了 Transformer 的局限性。

Result: 在 ROUGE-L 和 METEOR 上取得了有竞争力的性能。BLEU-4 显著提高，在数据集内和跨数据集评估中分别提高了 2.8 倍和 3.9 倍，达到 42.58 和 30.76。

Conclusion: 为整合 ECG 分析与 LLM 提出了一种新范例，并提供了该范例可行性的有力证据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AutoCO的端到端自动约束优化方法，通过学习使用LLM进行松弛来解决非线性组合优化问题(NCOPs)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束松弛方法依赖于缺乏系统自动化和可扩展适应性的专家驱动的迭代设计过程。而最近基于大型语言模型(LLM)的优化方法主要用作被动约束验证器，而不是主动策略架构师，无法处理NCOP固有的复杂约束交互。

Method: 利用结构化的LLM推理来生成约束松弛策略，这些策略通过统一的三重表示方案与算法原理和可执行代码动态演进。建立了一种新颖的双向(全局-局部)协同进化机制，将进化算法与蒙特卡洛树搜索相结合。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的NCOP基准测试中进行的综合实验验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能。

Conclusion: AutoCO方法通过学习使用LLM进行松弛，革新了NCOPs的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在一段时间内的推理能力变化，并探索神经符号架构在降低计算成本方面的潜力。

Method: 通过在PrOntoQA数据集上测试模型在不同时间的真假问题准确性，并使用神经符号架构将问题转换为标准形式，再由SMT求解器Z3解决。

Result: 2023年至2024年性能提升归因于隐藏的思维链提示，2024年至2025年由于思维模型的引入性能显著提升。神经符号方法在保持接近完美性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构能有效降低计算成本，同时保持高性能。推理FLOPs数量的近似计算公式在所有实验中都准确在10%以内。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的、无需训练的方法，即通过检索增强框架进行图推理（GRRAF），该方法利用了检索增强生成（RAG）以及大型语言模型（LLM）的代码生成能力来解决广泛的图推理任务。

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量的微调或依赖于预定义的算法，存在局限性。

Method: 将目标图存储在图数据库中，并提示LLM生成可执行的代码查询来检索必要的信息。该方法包含一个带有超时机制的错误反馈循环，以确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上的实验评估表明，GRRAF在大多数图推理任务上实现了100%的准确率，包括循环检测、二分图检查、最短路径计算和最大流，同时保持了一致的token成本，而与图的大小无关。在子图匹配上观察到不完美但仍然非常高的性能。值得注意的是，GRRAF可以有效地扩展到具有多达10,000个节点的大型图。

Conclusion: GRRAF在各种图推理任务上都表现出色，并且可以有效地扩展到大型图。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常将先前的经验和知识视为单一的整体，导致低效和粗粒度的知识迁移。

Method: 论文引入了分层记忆架构，将高层规划记忆与低层执行记忆分离，并提出了层级 hindsight reflection (H²R) 机制，从agent与环境的交互中提取可重用的分层知识。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验结果表明，H²R可以提高泛化和决策能力，优于先前的基线方法，如Expel。

Conclusion: H²R通过分离高层和低层记忆，使LLM agent能够有效地访问和利用与任务相关的知识，从而提升agent的性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker improves LLM reasoning by increasing the variance in generated latent thoughts through a learnable prior and distribution-based directional optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for complex reasoning in LLMs struggle with efficient generation and utilization of high-quality latent thoughts. A larger variance in the generated latent thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution.

Method: LTA-Thinker constructs a latent thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors. It also introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale using Semantic Alignment Loss and Reasoning Focus Loss.

Result: LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker effectively enhances reasoning performance by improving distributional variance and information efficiency in latent thought generation.

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

*Jai Singla,Peal Jotania,Keivalya Pandya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用深度学习和高分辨率卫星图像估算人口的方法，克服了传统人口普查的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人口调查和普查成本高、耗时，并且非常依赖人力资源。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络（CNN）对建筑物进行分类，区分住宅和非住宅，并使用人工神经网络（ANN）估算人口。使用了约4.8万个建筑物足迹的数据集。

Result: 该模型在大型数据集上表现出色，总体F1得分为0.9936，估计Gandhinagar的人口为278,954。

Conclusion: 该框架为市政当局提供了一个可扩展和可复制的工具，用于优化快速城市化城市中的资源管理，展示了人工智能驱动的地理空间分析在增强数据驱动的城市治理方面的效率。

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

*Xingxing Hong,Yungong Wang,Dexin Jin,Ye Yuan,Ximing Huang,Zijian Wu,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为HLSMAC的新的合作MARL基准，用于评估高级战略智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MARL基准（如SMAC）主要关注微观管理，限制了对高级战略智能的全面评估。

Method: 设计了12个基于《三十六计》的星际争霸II场景，并提出了新的评估指标。

Result: HLSMAC可以作为推进多智能体战略决策的强大测试平台。

Conclusion: HLSMAC为评估多智能体系统中的高级战略决策能力提供了一个有价值的工具。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

*Jeremias Ferrao,Matthijs van der Lende,Ilija Lichkovski,Clement Neo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种透明的对齐框架，通过训练轻量级适配器来引导行为，通过调节来自稀疏自动编码器 (SAE) 的可解释特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的对齐对于其可用性和安全性至关重要。然而，目前流行的RLHF方法会引起分散、不透明的参数变化，难以辨别模型内化的内容。

Method: 提出 Feature Steering with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL)，一种透明的对齐框架，通过训练轻量级适配器，通过调节来自稀疏自动编码器 (SAE) 的可解释特征来引导行为。

Result: FSRL 是一种有效的偏好优化方法，可与当前的 RLHF 方法相媲美。对训练后的适配器进行机械分析，发现其策略系统地提升了风格特征，而不是明确的对齐概念，这表明偏好优化过程将风格呈现作为质量的代表。

Conclusion: FSRL 提供了一种工具，可用于可解释的模型控制和诊断对齐的内部机制。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

*Shilian Chen,Jie Zhou,Tianyu Huai,Yujiang Lu,Junsong Li,Bihao Zhan,Qianjun Pan,Yutao Yang,Xin Li,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种黑盒模型融合（BMM）方法，用于解决大型语言模型（LLM）API 接口的权重不可访问问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型融合方法通常假设模型参数可访问，但对于像 GPT-4 这样的大型语言模型，通常只能通过 API 接口使用，模型权重不可用，这构成了黑盒模型融合的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于进化算法的无导数优化框架（Evo-Merging），该框架仅使用推理时 API 查询来实现有效的模型融合。该方法包括：(1) 基于稀疏性的去噪，用于识别和过滤模型中不相关或冗余的信息；(2) 符号感知缩放，用于基于模型性能动态计算相关模型的最佳组合权重。

Result: 在各种任务上取得了最先进的结果，显著优于现有的强大基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在黑盒模型融合任务上表现出色，解决了大型语言模型权重不可访问的问题。

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

*Bihao Zhan,Jie Zhou,Junsong Li,Yutao Yang,Shilian Chen,Qianjun Pan,Xin Li,Wen Wu,Xingjiao Wu,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PeCL的隐私增强持续学习框架，该框架通过动态差分隐私和隐私引导的记忆塑造来平衡隐私保护和模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐私方法对所有数据进行无差别保护，导致模型效用大幅下降，阻碍了CL在隐私敏感领域的部署。

Method: 引入令牌级动态差分隐私策略，自适应地分配隐私预算，并集成隐私引导的记忆塑造模块，选择性地遗忘敏感信息，保留任务不变的历史知识。

Result: PeCL在保持先前任务高准确性的同时，确保了强大的隐私性，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: PeCL实现了隐私保护和模型效用之间的良好平衡。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

### [131] [Toward PDDL Planning Copilot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12987)
*Yarin Benyamin,Argaman Mordoch,Shahaf S. Shperberg,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planning Copilot是一个聊天机器人，集成了多种规划工具，允许用户通过自然语言指令调用它们，以提高大型语言模型(llm)的长期规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)越来越多地被用作能够执行复杂任务的自主代理，但它们缺乏独立执行可靠的长期规划的能力。

Method: Planning Copilot利用模型上下文协议(MCP)，这是一种最近开发的将llm与外部工具和系统连接的标准。Planning Copilot支持常见的规划任务，如检查规划问题的语法、选择合适的规划器、调用它、验证它生成的计划以及模拟它们的执行。

Result: Planning Copilot的性能大大优于不使用规划工具的相同llm。Planning Copilot的性能也明显优于GPT-5，尽管它依赖于一个更小的llm。

Conclusion: 专门的规划工具可能是使llm能够执行规划任务的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究检验了安娜·卡列尼娜原则（AKP）及其逆向原则在不同文本类型中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究成功是否需要满足少量必要条件，而失败形式多样。

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，并评估过渡顺序和位置的收敛性。

Result: 结构原则因媒介而异：小说遵循逆向AKP，维基百科结合了AKP和有序模式，学术论文在顺序上显示逆向AKP，但在位置上仍然嘈杂，电影因类型而异。

Conclusion: 成功取决于特定于每种媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同的形式。

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为 MiniAgentPro 的可视化平台，用于模拟 Agent 社会，并提供了一个全面的测试集来评估 Agent 的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Agent 社会模拟框架缺乏对事件组织的系统评估，并且缺乏与物理环境的可视化集成，限制了 Agent 导航空间和与物品进行真实交互的能力。

Method: 开发了一个名为 MiniAgentPro 的可视化平台，该平台具有直观的地图编辑器和带有流畅动画的模拟播放器。基于此工具，引入了一个包含八个不同事件场景的综合测试集。

Result: 使用 GPT-4o 的评估表明，Agent 在基本设置中表现出色，但在困难变体中面临协调挑战。

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro 提供了一个有用的平台来评估和提高 Agent 在复杂环境中的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces
and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization
platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决带有偏好和结构约束的匹配问题（如大学招生）中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs在组合优化方面表现出色，但在匹配问题上的研究不足。

Method: 构建了一个包含369个大学招生问题的基准，评估了多个开源LLMs在可行性、稳定性和优化性方面的表现，并测试了不同的prompt策略（CoT, ICL, 角色扮演）和迭代prompt。

Result: LLMs在满足所有约束条件方面存在困难，推理型LLMs优于传统模型，不同prompt策略效果不一，迭代prompt效果非单调。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理性能和prompt策略在带偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一种用于金融犯罪合规 (FCC) 的 Agentic AI 系统，该系统在数字化金融平台中运行，旨在提高效率和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融犯罪合规的成本和复杂性不断上升，但效果提升不明显。现有AI解决方案不透明，与监管期望不符。

Method: 通过行动设计研究 (ADR)，与金融科技公司和监管机构合作，开发了一个 Agentic AI 系统。该系统采用 artifact-centric 建模，将角色分配给自治代理，并实现任务特定的模型路由和审计日志记录。

Result: 该研究提供了一个参考架构、一个真实世界的原型，以及关于 Agentic AI 如何在监管约束下重新配置 FCC 工作流的见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了信息系统 (IS) 文献中关于 AI 支持合规的内容，展示了嵌入在问责治理结构中的自动化如何在高风险、受监管的环境中支持透明度和机构信任。

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于图的冲突集提取算法（G-CSEA），用于解决劳动力调度中由伪布尔约束引起的不相容问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决劳动力调度中各种规则约束相互冲突导致模型不可行的问题，找出不可行性的根本原因。

Method: 提出了一种基于图的冲突集提取算法（G-CSEA），该算法通过在约束传播过程中构建蕴涵图，并在检测到冲突时，追踪所有相关的约束。

Result: 提出的G-CSEA算法可以提取冲突集，并可以选择使用QuickXplain算法进行最小化，以生成不可约不可行子集（IIS）。

Conclusion: G-CSEA算法为解决劳动力调度中的约束冲突问题提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）进行糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）检测，并模拟不同输出类型下的临床AI辅助效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和效用。确定最有效的输出格式以增强临床医生-AI性能是一个实证挑战，难以大规模评估。

Method: 在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上测试了GPT-4o和MedGemma两个模型，包括基线评估、模拟AI辅助和实际AI-AI协作。

Result: MedGemma在基线测试中表现优于GPT-4o，具有更高的灵敏度和AUROC。GPT-4o在MedGemma的描述性输出指导下，即使没有直接图像访问，也取得了强大的结果（AUROC高达0.96）。

Conclusion: MLLM可以改善DR筛查流程，并作为研究不同输出配置下临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 当前记忆架构的适应性、多模态整合和持续学习能力不足，无法满足通用人工智能（AGI）的需求。

Method: 通过情景驱动的方法，提取认知场景中的关键功能需求，从而形成下一代AI记忆系统的统一设计原则。基于此，提出了COLMA架构。

Result: 介绍了COLMA，一个集认知场景、记忆过程和存储机制于一体的框架。

Conclusion: COLMA为开发具有终身学习和类人推理能力的AI系统提供了一个结构化的基础，从而有助于AGI的实际发展。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt框架通过分离概念向量来精确干预LLM，解决了激活steering方法效果不精准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活steering方法会产生超出预期的影响，因此需要隔离更纯粹的概念向量，从而进行有针对性的干预并理解LLM行为。

Method: 提出RepIt框架，用于隔离概念特定的表示。

Result: RepIt在五个LLM上实现了精确的干预，例如选择性地抑制特定概念的拒绝，同时保留其他地方的拒绝。研究表明，校正信号仅定位于100-200个神经元，并且可以从少量示例中提取鲁棒的目标表示。

Conclusion: RepIt通过解耦拒绝向量，证明了有针对性的干预可以抵消过度泛化，为更精细的模型行为控制奠定基础。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了“认知形状”这一新概念，用于构建具有语言能力的智能代理 (LEIA)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知模型难以应对真实世界的复杂性。

Method: 通过记忆感觉、语言、概念、情景和程序知识的组合，使代理能够像人一样通过期望典型事物、识别模式、习惯性行动、类比推理等方式来降低认知负荷。

Result: 认知形状是一种通用术语，但它并非模糊不清。基于形状的建模涉及特定目标、假设、建模策略、知识库以及各种现象的实际模型，所有这些都在特定的认知架构中实现。LEIA 示例具有特异性，但其原理可以更广泛地应用，为基于知识和混合人工智能注入新的活力。

Conclusion: 认知形状为构建可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的智能代理系统提供了新思路，即使在关键领域也是如此。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

### [141] [ScaleDoc: Scaling LLM-based Predicates over Large Document Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12610)
*Hengrui Zhang,Yulong Hui,Yihao Liu,Huanchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ScaleDoc通过离线表示和在线过滤来解决LLM应用于非结构化文档时的高成本问题，以加速语义分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工作负载越来越多地涉及非结构化文档，这需要超越传统基于值的谓词的语义理解。大型语言模型（LLM）虽然具有强大的零样本能力，但其高推理成本导致了不可接受的开销。

Method: ScaleDoc将谓词执行解耦为离线表示阶段和优化的在线过滤阶段。离线阶段利用LLM为每个文档生成语义表示。在线阶段，针对每个查询，它在这些表示上训练一个轻量级代理模型，以过滤掉大部分文档，仅将模糊的情况转发给LLM进行最终决策。此外，ScaleDoc提出了两个核心创新：(1)一个基于对比学习的框架，训练代理模型以生成可靠的预测决策分数；(2)一个自适应级联机制，用于确定有效的过滤策略，同时满足特定的准确性目标。

Result: ScaleDoc在三个数据集上的评估表明，实现了超过2倍的端到端加速，并将昂贵的LLM调用减少了高达85%。

Conclusion: ScaleDoc使大规模语义分析变得实用和高效。

Abstract: Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However,
modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands
semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given
enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to
unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel
system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline
representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline
phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations
for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model
on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only
the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,
\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant
efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy
model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade
mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific
accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that
\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces
expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis
practical and efficient.

*Ke Sun,Mayi Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: KGTB: Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for POI recommendation with LLMs have limitations in encoding heterogeneous signals and understanding user mobility.

Method: Proposes KGTB, a KG-based tokenizer that quantizes each node into an individual structural ID and introduces multi-behavior learning for LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on four real-world city datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.

Conclusion: KGTB addresses the limitations of existing methods by preserving heterogeneous information and providing comprehensive insights on target POI visit behavior to LLMs.

Abstract: Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has
emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation.
Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a
tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by
LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for
next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two
limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals
in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)
previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while
ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of
mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph
Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).
Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)
format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous
information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into
an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,
thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB
proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific
prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit
behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive
insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LEAF是一个用于文本嵌入模型的知识蒸馏框架，它能使精简后的模型与原始模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本嵌入模型计算成本高的问题，提出了知识蒸馏框架LEAF，允许使用更小的模型服务查询，同时保持性能。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏，将大型教师模型的知识转移到小型叶模型，并确保叶模型与教师模型对齐。LEAF不需要判断或困难负样本，可以使用小批量进行训练。

Result: LEAF在BEIR和MTEB v2排行榜上都取得了同等规模模型中的最佳结果。leaf-ir在BEIR上排名第一，leaf-mt在MTEB v2（英语）上排名第一。

Conclusion: LEAF是一个有效的知识蒸馏框架，可以生成高性能且轻量级的文本嵌入模型，适用于信息检索等多项任务。

Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为InfoGain-RAG的框架，该框架利用名为DIG的新指标来量化检索文档对正确答案生成的贡献，从而过滤掉不相关的文档并选择最有价值的文档，以实现更好的答案生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG框架难以识别检索到的文档是否有意义地促进答案生成，这使得过滤掉不相关或误导性内容变得困难，从而影响最终性能。

Method: 论文提出Document Information Gain (DIG) 指标，通过计算LLM在有和没有文档增强的情况下的生成置信度差异来衡量文档的价值。同时，引入 InfoGain-RAG 框架，该框架利用 DIG 分数来训练一个专门的重排序器。

Result: 在各种模型和基准测试中，InfoGain-RAG 显著优于现有方法。在NaturalQA上，针对naive RAG、self-reflective RAG 和 modern ranking-based RAG，精确匹配准确率分别提高了 17.9%、4.5% 和 12.5%。在所有数据集上，高级专有模型 GPT-4o 的平均增量为 15.3%。

Conclusion: InfoGain-RAG 为 RAG 提供了一个可靠的解决方案，并且在多个应用中具有可行性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

*Zechao Liu,Zheng Zhou,Xiangkun Chen,Tao Liang,Dapeng Lang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于扩散的深度哈希针对性攻击方法 DiffHash，以解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度哈希模型容易受到对抗样本的攻击，并且现有的针对性攻击方法缺乏多模态指导，依赖标签信息和像素级操作。

Method: 通过大型语言模型 (LLM) 生成的目标图像的文本信息引导，优化图像的潜在表示。设计了一个多空间哈希对齐网络，以将高维图像空间和文本空间对齐到低维二进制哈希空间。在重建过程中，还结合了文本引导的注意力机制来细化对抗性示例。

Result: 该方法优于最先进 (SOTA) 的有针对性的攻击方法，实现了更好的黑盒可转移性，并在数据集上提供了更出色的稳定性。

Conclusion: DiffHash 是一种有效的深度哈希模型针对性攻击方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of
large-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security
risks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the
increasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing
approaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on
labeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To
address these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based
targeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that
directly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach
focuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text
information generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image.
Furthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the
high-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash
space. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention
mechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the
target semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments
have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted
attack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more
excellent stability across datasets.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为可学习的完全交互双塔模型（FIT）的新架构，该架构能够在确保推理效率的同时实现丰富的信息交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双塔模型因其效率和效果之间的良好平衡而被广泛应用于预排序系统中，但这种独立性也导致了两个塔之间的信息交互不足，从而降低了效果。

Method: FIT主要由元查询模块（MQM）和轻量级相似度评分器（LSS）两部分组成。MQM引入了一个可学习的item meta矩阵，以实现用户和item特征之间富有表现力的早期交互。此外，LSS旨在进一步获得用户和item towers之间有效的晚期交互。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的FIT明显优于最先进的基线预排序模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的预排序模型FIT，通过MQM和LSS模块增强了用户和物品特征之间的信息交互，实验证明其性能优于现有模型。

Abstract: Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by
significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints
of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is
widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and
effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user
and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or
similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of
information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less
effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully
Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information
interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two
parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS).
Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive
early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to
further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.
Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed
FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.

TL;DR: 本研究关注如何在保护用户隐私的同时，生成包含社会人口统计信息且满足k-匿名性的OD矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OD矩阵研究在用户隐私保护方面存在不足，尤其是在考虑到数据代表性和实际人口的隐私时。

Method: 提出了一个新的k-匿名方法ODkAnon，并与现有的地理区域泛化方法（ATG、OIGH和Mondrian）进行了比较。

Result: 通过实验比较了几种匿名化方法在保护调查参与者和整个人口方面的k-匿名性效果。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在生成具有隐私保护的、富含社会人口统计信息的OD矩阵，并在实际人口中实现k-匿名性。

Abstract: Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'
mobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These
regions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without
incurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the
NetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot
of socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD
matrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is
not merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a
segment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in
the anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to
our contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for
representativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual
population, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in
this work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey
participants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional
methods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas.
These include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical
Mondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a
greedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous
approaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets,
we aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices
enriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the
actual population.

Motivation: 随着全球变暖，评估和减少推荐系统对环境的影响的需求变得越来越迫切。推荐系统社区对他们的工作的环境影响几乎不了解、不处理和不评估。

Method: 通过重现典型的实验流程来检查推荐系统研究对环境的影响。分析了 2013 年和 2023 年 ACM RecSys 会议的 79 篇论文，比较了传统的“优秀的传统 AI”模型与现代深度学习模型。使用硬件能量计测量能量消耗并将其转换为 CO2 当量。

Result: 使用深度学习模型的论文排放的 CO2 当量大约是使用传统模型的论文的 42 倍。平均而言，一篇基于深度学习的论文产生 2,909 公斤的 CO2 当量。

Conclusion: 推荐系统和更广泛的机器学习社区迫切需要采用绿色 AI 原则，平衡算法进步和环境责任，以利用 AI 驱动的个性化构建可持续的未来。

Abstract: As global warming soars, the need to assess and reduce the environmental
impact of recommender systems is becoming increasingly urgent. Despite this,
the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates
the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the
environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical
experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for
researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of
their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems
designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our
analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences,
comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning
models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for
both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and
converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep
learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers
using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper
generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions
of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2
sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need
for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt
green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental
responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于BPE分词和预训练LLM嵌入的冷启动推荐策略，以解决新用户或新项目缺乏交互数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于内容的特征或混合解决方案只能在稀疏元数据环境和浅层模式下工作，因此需要新的方法来解决冷启动问题。

Method: 该方法使用BPE分词和预训练LLM嵌入来获得细粒度的token级别向量，并将其用作未见实体的密集语义先验。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在Recall@k, NDCG@k和Hit Rate指标上优于标准基线，并且具有足够的计算性能。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，使用子词感知嵌入可以提高泛化能力和可解释性，尤其是在多语言和稀疏输入设置中。token级别语义初始化可以作为现代推荐系统的轻量级但有效的扩展。

Abstract: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,
especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new
users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as
conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment
with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation
strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by
applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language
Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained
token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to
using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can
be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate
recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our
mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over
benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings
show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit
Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same
capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more
interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The
practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,
but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the
zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

Motivation: 由于安全问题和匿名化真实系统所需的大量工作，公开可用的测试用例仍然稀缺。这种局限性需要能够共同合成电网结构和节点动态的生成工具。

Conclusion: PowerGrow 能够生成操作有效的 Realistic 电网场景。

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

Motivation: 大规模DNN训练缺乏稳定性、可扩展性和通用性，阻碍了分散学习的生产应用。

Method: 引入基准测试框架DBench，通过改变通信图和训练规模，揭示模型精度与参数张量方差之间的相关性，并提出自适应方法Ada。

Result: 发现分散学习的模型精度与通信图的连接数相关，且对模型副本间参数张量的方差非常敏感。Ada在分散DNN训练中始终能获得最佳收敛速度，并能实现与集中学习同样或相当好的模型精度。

Conclusion: Ada方法能够有效提升大规模分散DNN训练的性能，使其在实际应用中具有竞争力。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

Result: 在双语恶意提示基准测试中，MEUV在Gemma-2-2B、LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen-7B上实现了不低于87%的攻击成功率，与最佳单向基线相比，跨主题泄漏减少了高达90%。中文训练的向量几乎不变地转移到英语（反之亦然）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，细粒度的、主题级别的能力激活可以通过最小的效用损失来实现，为在安全敏感领域中受控的LLM部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于在卫星网络上调度联邦学习的框架，以解决动态拓扑和有限带宽带来的挑战，并通过动态分配通信资源来加速联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题和监管限制，远程客户端收集的原始数据无法集中聚合，这对传统AI训练方法构成了主要障碍。卫星系统的动态拓扑和有限带宽会阻碍及时的参数聚合和分发，从而导致训练时间延长。

Method: 我们研究了在卫星网络上调度联邦学习的问题，并确定了影响每个训练回合总持续时间的关键瓶颈。我们提出了一个基于离散时间图的按需调度框架，该框架动态地分配通信资源以加速联邦学习。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统的基于统计复用的模型交换策略相比，所提出的方法实现了显着的性能提升，总体回合时间减少了14.20％至41.48％。

Conclusion: 对于较大的模型和较多的客户端，加速效果更加明显，突出了所提出方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的空气动力学形状优化框架，可以直接从车辆点云数据中进行快速空气动力学分析和形状优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于计算流体动力学的气动形状优化计算成本高，严重限制了设计空间探索。

Method: 采用变分自编码器，具有基于三平面隐式神经表示的高保真3D几何重建和阻力系数预测头。

Result: 优化后的设计实现了高达11.8%的阻力系数降低。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更敏捷的空气动力学形状优化工作流程，减少了对计算密集型CFD仿真的依赖，尤其是在早期设计阶段。

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Motivation: 针对流行病控制的MPC设计通常假设1）动力学状态可测量，参数已学习，或2）模型参数已知，状态已学习。本文旨在仅使用带噪声的感染状态，在MPC框架内联合实时估计状态和参数。

Method: 提出了MPC-PINNs，log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs) 和 split-integral PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs) 等算法，并将它们整合到MPC框架中。针对基本传染数已知的情况，简化了MPC-SI-PINNs为split-PINNs (MPC-S-PINNs)。

Result: 实验结果表明了所提出方法在不同设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将这些算法纳入MPC框架，可以同时估计流行病状态和参数，同时生成最优控制策略。

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

Motivation: 在消费级GPU上，尤其是在严格的8GB VRAM限制下，对此类训练的效率仍然缺乏探索。

Method: 使用NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU，对Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct模型进行LoRA/QLoRA微调的受控分析研究。系统地改变批量大小、序列长度、优化器选择（AdamW vs. PagedAdamW）和精度（fp16 vs. bf16）。

Result: Paged优化器将吞吐量提高了高达25%（628 tok/s vs. 500 tok/s基线），而bf16相对于fp16降低了效率。尽管有8 GB的限制，但使用参数有效的策略，高达2048个tokens的序列长度是可行的。

Conclusion: 这是首次对消费级GPU上LLM微调效率的系统案例研究，为资源受限的研究人员和从业者提供可重现的基准和实践指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Method: 使用独立的路由器进行每种模态预测的稀疏混合专家方法 PerM-MoE。

Result: 在大多数模态缺失的变体中，PerM-MoE 优于当前最优模型，并展示了比 Flex-MoE 更有效的专家利用率。

Conclusion: PerM-MoE 是一种在模态缺失情况下更灵活有效的多模态预测模型。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize
challenges in deploying MT-DQN in real-world scenarios, such as its
computational cost and latency sensitivity during online inference, which will
be addressed through future architectural optimization.

Motivation: 当前对于SFT和RL协同作用背后的演变和机制尚不明确，并且存在一些不确定的因素。

Method: 通过SVD分析参数矩阵，手动编辑它们，并观察它们对模型性能的影响。

Result: (1) SFT的OOD性能在早期达到峰值后下降（OOD遗忘）；(2) 后续的RL阶段并没有产生根本上更好的OOD能力，而是起到了OOD恢复的作用；(3) 恢复能力有界限，如果SFT训练时间太短或太长，RL都无法恢复失去的OOD能力；(4) OOD行为与奇异向量的旋转密切相关。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了SFT和RL在两阶段微调中的角色，并发现奇异向量的旋转是关键机制。

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

Motivation: 确保尺寸精度和可靠性，准确预测结构部件的加工变形至关重要。这种变形通常源于残余应力场，其分布和影响随几何复杂性而显着变化。传统的残余应力与变形耦合建模数值方法计算成本高昂，尤其是在考虑各种几何形状时。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决受不同几何形状影响的结构部件的变形预测问题提供了一种有效且计算效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对JEPA的行为理解不足，所以本文对其进行了理论表征。

Method: 本文对一个简单的JEPA变体进行了理论分析，该变体带有一个与潜在动态联合训练的辅助回归头。通过实验验证了理论结果。

Result: 证明了一个“无不健康表征崩溃”定理：在确定性MDP中，如果训练使潜在转换一致性损失和辅助回归损失都降为零，那么任何一对非等价的观测值（即那些不具有相同转换动态或辅助标签的观测值）必须映射到不同的潜在表征。辅助任务决定了表征必须保留哪些区别。在计数环境中的受控消融实验证实了该理论，并表明与单独训练相比，与辅助头联合训练JEPA模型可以生成更丰富的表征。

Conclusion: 本文表明了一种改进JEPA编码器的途径：使用辅助函数对其进行训练，该辅助函数与转换动态一起，编码正确的等价关系。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE 框架具有适应银行规模网络的能力，其归纳能力、可扩展性和可解释性为金融机构利用图机器学习提供了行动见解的蓝图。

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Transformer架构中的缩放点积函数或softmax函数提供新的解释。

Method: 将值向量、键向量和查询向量序列建模为高斯分布序列，其中高斯分布的方差取决于时间步长、相应的键向量和查询向量，均值取决于时间步长和相应的值向量。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 分析可能为Transformer架构中的缩放点积函数或softmax函数提供新的解释，并提出了基于最大熵方法的另一种解释。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial
Networks (QGANs) for stock price prediction. Financial markets are inherently
complex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional
models often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing,
offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with
quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for
stock price prediction and evaluate its performance using historical stock
market data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data
closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction
accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and
the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The
quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research
represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial
forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over
traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders,
financial analysts, and researchers seeking advanced tools for market analysis.

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，C3DE 具有卓越的性能，特别是在流量波动显着的城市中。

Conclusion: C3DE 模型能够有效地模拟人群流量的长期动态，并在长期城市人群流量预测中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了传统单隐藏层神经网络中 Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) 几何的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络如何学习准备输入数据以及加速学习。

Method: 通过 Jacobian 矩阵 J(x) 的外幂的统计特性来量化 KA 几何。

Result: 发现训练传统单隐藏层神经网络时，通常会产生 KA 几何。

Conclusion: 对函数复杂度和模型超参数空间中 KA 几何出现的位置有了初步的理解。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了预测建模和优化之间的差距，为生鲜食品零售和其他处理易腐货物的行业提供了可扩展的动态定价和库存管理解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Conclusion: 傅里叶嵌入能有效提升神经算子学习效果，为偏微分方程代理建模提供了一种稳健且广泛适用的方法。

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Method: 本文研究了主成分分析 (PCA) 和线性判别分析 (LDA)。同时提出了 Partitioned-LDA，它将嵌入分割成大小相等的块，并分别对每个块执行 LDA，从而减小协方差矩阵的大小。

Result: PCA 在适当的子空间维度下可以胜过原始嵌入。应用收缩可以显著提高 LDA 的性能，即使只有两个维度。Partitioned-LDA 优于常规 LDA，并且与收缩相结合，在竞赛公共排行榜上实现了前 10 名的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了在训练样本有限的表格数据分类中词嵌入的性能。

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Conclusion: MEAGraph 提供了一种有效的表示学习和聚类方法，可用于数据分析、异常值检测和数据集优化。

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Motivation: 下一代反应堆的规模和功率输出更小，可能产生大量的多变量时间序列数据，可用于增强实时监测和控制。因此，开发用于反应堆运行的远程自主或半自主控制系统引起了人们的兴趣。关键的第一步是准确的诊断模块，能够检测和定位反应堆系统内的异常。

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

*Janik Henn,Adrian Hauptmannl,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用人工智能模型来检测3D模型中的常见问题，以帮助经验不足的用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 吸引更广泛的受众，因为他们缺乏经验，并且3D打印模型中存在难以打印的几何图形，容易导致打印失败。

Method: 训练一个人工智能模型来检测3D模型中的常见问题。

Result: 通过识别可能导致打印失败的特征来帮助经验不足的用户。

Conclusion: 目标是在打印开始之前，识别出由于难以打印的几何图形而可能导致打印失败的特征，从而帮助经验不足的用户。

Abstract: 3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and
enthusiasts willing to tinker or even build their own machines. This stands in
stark contrast to today's market, where recent developments have prioritized
ease of use to attract a broader audience. Slicing software nowadays has a few
ways to sanity check the input file as well as the output gcode. Our approach
introduces a novel layer of support by training an AI model to detect common
issues in 3D models. The goal is to assist less experienced users by
identifying features that are likely to cause print failures due to difficult
to print geometries before printing even begins.

### [182] [Adaptive Spatial Goodness Encoding: Advancing and Scaling Forward-Forward Learning Without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12394)
*Qingchun Gong,Robert Bogdan Staszewski,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于FF的CNN训练框架，名为自适应空间优度编码(ASGE)，该框架通过利用特征图在每一层计算空间感知优度表示，从而实现层级监督，解决了通道爆炸问题，并在多个基准测试中优于其他FF方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于FF的扩展方法通常受到有限的表征能力和较差的可扩展性的限制，这主要是由于通道维度爆炸。

Method: 提出自适应空间优度编码(ASGE)，通过特征图计算空间感知优度表示，实现层级监督，从而解耦分类复杂度和通道维度。

Result: ASGE在MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的测试精度分别为99.65%、93.41%、90.62%和65.42%。在ImageNet上，Top-1和Top-5的精度分别为26.21%和47.49%。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，并显著缩小了与BP训练模型之间的性能差距，为可扩展的无BP CNN训练奠定了可行的基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

*Mohammad Nooraiepour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为贝叶斯参数矩阵模型（B-PMMs）的框架，用于提供不确定性估计，同时保持其光谱结构和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的光谱学习方法仅提供点估计，而没有不确定性量化，限制了它们在安全关键型应用中的使用。参数矩阵模型在学习控制方程方面表现出色，但其确定性限制了其在不确定性量化应用中的部署。

Method: 提出了B-PMMs，包括自适应谱分解、结构化变分推理算法和有限样本校准保证。

Result: B-PMMs在不同矩阵维度上实现了出色的不确定性校准，并在光谱病态条件下表现出优雅的降级。

Conclusion: 该框架支持不确定性关键领域中的鲁棒光谱学习，并为更广泛的贝叶斯光谱机器学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

### [184] [Surrogate Representation Inference for Noisy Text and Image Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12416)
*Kentaro Nakamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为Surrogate Representation Inference (SRI) 的新方法，用于纠正下游统计分析中的偏差，该方法假设非结构化数据完全介导了人类注释和结构化变量之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的纠偏方法通常会产生较大的标准误差，并且需要一些无误差的人工注释。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 该方法提出了一种神经网络架构，用于学习非结构化数据的低维表示，并利用半参数有效估计策略。

Result: 模拟研究和实际应用表明，当机器学习预测精度适中时，SRI可以将标准误差降低50%以上，即使人工注释包含非差异测量误差，也能提供有效的推断。

Conclusion: SRI方法在纠正偏差和减少标准误差方面具有显著优势，即使在存在人工注释误差的情况下也适用。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

### [185] [On the Regularity and Fairness of Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12457)
*Xiaoyi Wu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数化的规则和公平学习算法，以实现最大化累积奖励、保证arm之间的公平性和确保奖励规则性这三个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中，最大化累积奖励，保证arm之间的公平性，并确保奖励规则性非常重要。

Method: 该算法线性组合了虚拟队列长度（跟踪公平性违规）、Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) 指标和 Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) 估计。

Result: 通过探索虚拟队列长度和 TSLR 指标之间的关键关系，并利用几个重要的 Lyapunov 函数，从分析上表征了在所提出的算法下的零累积公平性违规、奖励规则性和累积后悔性能。

Conclusion: 通过基于两个真实世界数据集的仿真验证了这些理论结果。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种非局部神经正切核（NNTK），以扩展NTK理论到非光滑函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经正切核（NTK）框架依赖于网络对其参数的可微性假设，当考虑非光滑目标函数或表现出不可微行为的参数化模型时，该假设会失效。

Method: 用参数空间中的非局部交互近似代替局部梯度，提出了非局部神经正切核（NNTK）。

Result: 通过数值研究说明了新公式。

Conclusion: 非局部梯度比标准梯度存在于更广泛的函数类别中。这允许NTK理论扩展到非光滑函数、随机估计器和更广泛的模型系列。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究对比了边界元法（BEM）和物理信息神经网络（PINN）在求解二维亥姆霍兹方程中的波散射问题上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估BEM和PINN在相同条件下的性能表现。

Method: 使用BEM和PINN求解相同的散射问题，通过最小化控制方程和边界条件的残差来训练PINN，并通过超参数优化确定其配置，同时使用边界离散化应用BEM。从解的准确性、计算时间和泛化能力方面评估这两种方法。

Result: 数值实验表明，在相当的精度下，PINN产生了一致的解，但训练时间比BEM长约42倍。然而，一旦经过训练，PINN的评估时间最多可快204倍。在PINN训练域之外评估了泛化能力，相对误差从$7.46 \times 10^{-2}$增加到8.22，而BEM在扩展区域中保持了相似的误差水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作直接比较了PINN和BEM在亥姆霍兹方程中的应用。该分析提供了关于两种方法性能的定量数据，支持在未来波传播问题研究中选择它们，并确定了未来的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为非训练修改 (NTM) 的新型神经网络架构，用于计算图上随机微分博弈 (SDG) 中的纳什均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、机器人、能源和社会动力学中，智能体在不确定性下进行局部交互，对这些图中涌现出的大量图结构多智能体系统进行建模。

Method: NTM 架构对前馈神经网络施加了一种图引导的稀疏化，嵌入了与底层图拓扑结构对齐的固定、非训练组件。

Result: NTM 在静态图博弈中具有普遍逼近性质，并通过监督学习任务验证了其表达性和鲁棒性。在各种图结构上的三个 SDG 的数值实验表明，基于 NTM 的方法实现了与完全可训练的同类方法相当的性能，同时提供了更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: NTM-DP 和 NTM-DBSDE 在计算效率方面有所提高。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了基础模型在预测脑活动和识别神经群体之间因果关系方面的能力，并将其与传统方法进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探讨基础模型在神经科学中的应用，特别是在预测脑信号和进行因果分析方面，以揭示认知和疾病的潜在机制。

Method: 该研究使用了功能磁共振成像（fMRI）测量的人类自发脑活动，并利用基础模型和传统的Wiener-Granger因果关系方法进行分析。通过合成时间序列验证了该方法。

Result: 基础模型在零样本预测fMRI时间序列方面表现出竞争力，并且能够更精确地检测因果关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基础模型在时间序列数据的预测和因果发现方面具有通用性、强大的零样本性能和潜在的实用性。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)的一个新的安全风险：MLLM的输出偏好可以被精心优化的图像任意操纵。提出了一个名为Preference Hijacking (Phi)的新方法，用于操纵MLLM的响应偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)在各个领域受到了广泛关注，但它们的广泛应用也引发了严重的安全问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Preference Hijacking (Phi)的新方法，用于利用偏好劫持图像操纵MLLM的响应偏好。该方法在推理时有效，不需要修改模型。此外，还引入了一种通用劫持扰动，它可以嵌入到不同的图像中，以将MLLM响应劫持到任何攻击者指定的偏好。

Result: 实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MLLM的输出偏好可以被精心优化的图像任意操纵。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

reduced via batching).

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络在异质图上表现不佳，即使是最简单的MLP也优于它们。许多方法侧重于架构设计，但没有直接针对异质性问题的根本原因。

Method: 提出GRAPHITE框架，通过创建特征节点来促进共享相似特征的节点之间的同质消息传递，从而显式地转换图以直接提高图同质性。

Result: 理论和实验表明，GRAPHITE显著提高了原始异质图的同质性，同时图大小仅略有增加。在具有挑战性的数据集上的大量实验表明，GRAPHITE在异质图上显著优于最先进的方法，同时在同质图上实现了与最先进方法相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种通过图转换直接提高图同质性的新范例，并通过GRAPHITE框架实现了在异质图上的性能提升。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法可以准确分类具有不同属性的时间序列数据，对异常具有高灵敏度，并实现了高检测精度、快速检测速度和强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

Result: 在 CIFAR10-H 和 ImageNet16-H 上的实验表明，该方法始终优于独立模型和最强的专家，精度达到 99.57±0.10% 和 99.40±0.52%，同时将专家工作量减少了 11 倍。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，该方法为实际人机协作提供了一种可扩展的、无需重新训练的 L2D 替代方案。

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI模型难以利用多模态数据中的丰富信息，并且提取的表征泛化性差。因此，本文旨在解决泛癌预后预测的问题。

Method: MICE采用多个功能不同的专家，通过对比学习和监督学习相结合，从而增强模型的泛化性。

Result: MICE在内部队列和独立队列上均优于 unimodal 模型和现有的 multi-expert-based 多模态模型。

Conclusion: MICE具有增强的泛化性和数据效率，为个性化治疗和改善治疗效果奠定了有效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的频域感知联邦学习方法 (FedFD)，通过过滤掉低能量（如高频分量）来减少通信成本并优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习框架存在冗余信息和噪声，增加了通信负担。

Method: 利用离散余弦变换将能量集中到特定区域，并使用二元掩码保留低频分量，同时通过真实数据驱动的合成分类来提高低频分量的质量。

Result: 在五个图像和语音数据集上，FedFD 实现了优于现有技术方法的性能，同时降低了通信成本。例如，在 CIFAR-10 数据集上，Dirichlet 系数 α = 0.01 时，FedFD 实现了至少 37.78% 的通信成本降低，同时获得了 10.88% 的性能提升。

Conclusion: FedFD 方法在减少通信成本和优化性能方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

*Chan Sik Han,Keon Myung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的异常检测方法 TimeRep，它利用时间序列基础模型 (TSFM) 的中间层表示，将异常评分计算为这些表示之间的距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据中的异常检测对于许多实际系统的可靠运行至关重要。最近，时间序列基础模型 (TSFM) 已成为一种强大的异常检测工具。然而，现有的方法通常依赖于 TSFM 最后一层的表示，通过特定于任务的头部将异常评分计算为重建或预测误差。

Method: TimeRep 选择产生信息量最大的中间层和patch-token位置。TimeRep 从训练数据中形成中间表示的参考集合，并应用核心集策略来减少其大小，同时保持分布覆盖。在推理过程中，TimeRep 通过测量其中间表示与集合中的中间表示之间的距离来计算传入数据的异常评分。为了解决概念漂移，TimeRep 集成了一种自适应机制，该机制在推理时专门用来自传入数据的非冗余中间表示来扩充集合。

Result: 在包含 250 个单变量时间序列的 UCR 异常档案上进行了大量实验。TimeRep 始终优于各种最先进的基线，包括非深度学习、深度学习和基于基础模型的方法。

Conclusion: TimeRep 是一种很有前途的异常检测方法，它优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的评估不稳定，少量随机因素变化会导致分数和模型排名剧烈波动。此外，不同的 LLM 对随机因素的特定设置有不同的偏好。因此，使用固定的随机因素设置会导致 LLM 之间潜在的不公平比较。论文提出了实例级别随机化 (ILR) 方法，通过对每个实例随机化所有影响评估分数的因素，运行多次实验并报告平均分数，以减少方差和增强模型比较的公平性。理论分析和实验结果表明，ILR 可以减少由随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，并且与以前的方法相比，以不到一半的计算成本实现相似的鲁棒性水平。

Motivation: 当前LLM评估由于随机因素不稳定，导致LLM之间比较不公平

Method: 提出实例级别随机化 (ILR) 方法，对每个实例随机化所有影响评估分数的因素，运行多次实验并报告平均分数

Result: ILR 可以减少由随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，并且与以前的方法相比，以不到一半的计算成本实现相似的鲁棒性水平。

Conclusion: ILR方法能够有效提升LLM评估的稳定性和公平性

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.
