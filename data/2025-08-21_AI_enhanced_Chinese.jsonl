Explicitly, we start\nthe article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental\ntheorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions\ncorresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study\nthe other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the\nspeckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean\npreservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various\nlevels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated\nvia an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of\nsamples.

We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from\nIsraeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three\ncomplexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,\nand reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results\nshowed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base\nperformance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly\n(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited\neffectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent\nframework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive\nfunctions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,\nand validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range\nmodels. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus\n69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity\nquestions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty\nperformance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning\nchallenges that persisted with RAG enhancement.

Urban\nflooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,\nthreatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making\nremains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among\ncompeting goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)\nrequires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental\nconditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies\nfrequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.\nExisting methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent\ncoordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates\nknowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven\noptimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from\nmulti-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We\nevaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three\nrepresentative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily\nlight rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and\nreinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and\nsystem robustness.

Results show strong\nfidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,\nand SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,\nlocalized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens\nopportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data\naugmentation in dental AI workflows.

For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by\ntraining models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using\nspecialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more\nefficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are\nadapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust\ngeneralization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when\nexposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these\ndesign choices influence generalization remains an open question with\nsignificant practical implications.

Our findings reveal\nthat synthetic data pretraining outperforms traditional augmentation methods in\nsome cases and yields complementary benefits when implemented alongside them.\nOur approach democratizes sign generation and synthetic data pretraining for\nSLR by providing computationally efficient methods that achieve significant\nperformance improvements across diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCMLPe\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7b26\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3SLR\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b(SLR)\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCMLPe\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7b26\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u5b9e\u65bd\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLSFB\u548cDiSPLaY\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

While traditional anomaly detection methods\nprimarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at\nhome at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in\ncollective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home\nalone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.\nUnlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling\nspatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Existing approaches for this task rely\nsolely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the\nintrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and\nreduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose\nHRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose\nestimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud\nrepresentations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples\nobject pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately\nencoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a\ncontrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on\nour 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds\nfrom multiple categories by considering rotational and translational\ndifferences as well as categorical information. We further design pose\nestimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and\ntranslation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose\nsuccessfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25\nbenchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only\nstate-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness\nand potential for real-world applications.

This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational\nprinciple of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need\nto match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite\nthe importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive\nstudies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension\ndifficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of\nChinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading\ncomprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade\nteachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers\nnationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot\nlearning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of\nrandom guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance\nimproves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy\nof their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging\nabilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in\ntheir current training for educationally aligned judgment.

The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by\ntheir computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing\nstrategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods\nhave been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation\nbetween skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot\nprocess large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy\npoints, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on\nregistration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread\napplicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based\ncoarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated\ncorrespondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud\ntransformations.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.
