### [1] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of LLMs to annotate the quality of financial arguments, finding high agreement but also gender bias, and suggests ways to improve annotation methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the quality of financial arguments remains poorly studied in the literature, despite their critical role in shaping investment decisions and public trust in financial institutions.

Method: The paper examines the capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the FinArgQuality dataset. The paper introduces an adversarial attack designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and alignment with human labels.

Result: LLM-generated annotations achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human annotations, but the models exhibit varying degrees of gender bias.

Conclusion: LLM-based annotations achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. The paper provides a multifaceted analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation methodologies.

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Council debate method using multiple LLMs excels at detecting references to scientific studies in tweets, but not scientific claims or entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for the scientific web discourse detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025, specifically to identify scientific claims, references to scientific studies, or mentions of scientific entities in tweets.

Method: A novel council debate method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of scientific entities. Explored three debating methods: i) single debate, ii) team debate, and iii) council debate.

Result: The proposed council debate method ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies but did not rank highly for identifying scientific claims or mentions of scientific entities.

Conclusion: The council debate method, where multiple expert models deliberate together to reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model, ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [3] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在认知共情方面超越人类，但在情感共情方面有所欠缺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型日益普及，并在专业和个人领域被全球数百万人使用，它们越来越多地充当虚拟助手和同伴。在人际互动中，有效的沟通通常涉及两种共情：认知共情（理解他人的想法和情感）和情感共情（在情感上分享他人的感受）。

Method: 使用标准化心理测试来调查小型和大型语言模型的认知和情感共情能力。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务上始终优于人类，包括心理学学生。然而，无论小型还是大型语言模型，其情感共情能力均低于人类参与者。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务上始终优于人类，包括心理学学生。但它们的情感共情能力明显低于人类参与者。这表明语言模型在模拟认知共情方面具有巨大潜力，为提供有效的虚拟陪伴和个性化情感支持提供了可能。此外，它们较高的认知共情能力和较低的情感共情能力使得它们能够提供客观和一致的情感支持，而不会面临情感疲劳或偏见。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

### [4] [Real-time News Story Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08272)
*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-time story identification approach for news monitoring, combining text representation, clustering, and online topic modeling. Evaluated on Slovene media, it shows sensible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical collections, called stories. This work presents an approach for implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system.

Method: The approach combines text representation techniques, clustering algorithms, and online topic modeling methods, such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust. It extracts specific events and named entities necessary for story identification.

Result: The approach was evaluated on a news dataset from Slovene media covering a period of 1 month.

Conclusion: The real-time approach produces sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

### [5] [TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08273)
*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TT-XAI框架通过关键词提炼和LLM推理，提升了临床语言模型的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床语言模型在应用于冗长、非结构化的电子健康记录(ehr)时，常常难以提供值得信赖的预测和解释。

Method: 该框架通过领域感知关键词提炼和大型语言模型(llm)推理来改进分类性能和可解释性。首先，将原始的出院记录提炼成简洁的关键词表示，显著提高了BERT分类器的性能，并通过LIME的focused variant提高了局部解释的保真度。其次，使用关键词引导的提示来引导llm生成chain-of-thought临床解释，从而产生更简洁和临床相关的推理。

Result: 所有评估方式都一致支持关键词增强方法，证实了提炼增强了机器和人类的可解释性。

Conclusion: TT-XAI通过领域感知关键词提炼和大型语言模型推理，提高了分类性能和可解释性，为临床决策支持中可信、可审计的AI提供了一条可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

### [6] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCBM, a transparent method using adjectives as concepts, outperforms existing methods in hate speech detection with high interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such content important. Prior models are black-box.

Method: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), using adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks.

Result: SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out of five datasets. Fusing adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings leads to a 1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets.

Conclusion: Adjective-based concept representations are compact, interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition. The method can be applied to other NLP tasks with adapted adjectives.

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench: a comprehensive benchmark for continual instruction tuning of MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in MLLMs is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks.

Method: We combine final answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by a specially trained CoT evaluator; We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning paradigms; We select and organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains.

Result: Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; Reasoning chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical forgetting hypothesis; The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; In reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.

### [8] [Evaluating Contrast Localizer for Identifying Causal Unitsin Social & Mathematical Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08276)
*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用对比定位器来识别LLM和VLM中与ToM和数学推理相关的单元，发现低激活单元和数学定位器单元对性能的影响超出了预期，质疑了对比定位器的因果相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在研究LLM和VLM中与ToM和数学推理任务相关的因果单元。

Method: 使用神经科学对比定位器来精确定位大型语言模型 (LLM) 和视觉语言模型 (VLM) 中与心理理论 (ToM) 和数学推理任务相关的因果单元，并通过靶向消融评估它们的因果作用。

Result: 低激活单元有时会比高激活单元产生更大的性能下降，并且来自数学定位器的单元通常比来自 ToM 定位器的单元更损害 ToM 性能。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性受到质疑，需要更广泛的刺激集和更准确地捕获特定于任务的单元。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

*Haoze Du,Richard Li,Edward Gehringer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Framework to evaluate LLMs using class materials for objective assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM performance is critical but challenging due to subjective assessments.

Method: The framework utilizes subjective metrics from class textual materials and well-defined benchmarks to evaluate LLMs.

Result: The framework ensures consistent, reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements by automating scoring and reducing human interpretation.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a framework that uses class textual materials to evaluate LLM outputs, offering a scalable solution for performance assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM: integrates LLMs with Behavior Trees and Formal Grammars to enable natural language control of multi-agent systems. Method B increases syntactic validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over baseline. Smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: enable natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined environments

Method: integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars

Result: Method B increases syntactic validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over baseline.

Conclusion: Smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

### [11] [The Illusion of Progress: Re-evaluating Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08285)
*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current evaluation practices for hallucination detection in LLMs are flawed due to reliance on metrics like ROUGE. Semantically aware evaluation frameworks are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with human judgments.

Method: Through comprehensive human studies and analysis of existing detection methods.

Result: ROUGE exhibits high recall but extremely low precision, leading to misleading performance estimates. Several established detection methods show performance drops of up to 45.9% when assessed using human-aligned metrics like LLM-as-Judge. Simple heuristics based on response length can rival complex detection techniques.

Conclusion: The trustworthiness of LLM outputs can be ensured by adopting semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

### [12] [Jointly Generating and Attributing Answers using Logits of Document-Identifier Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08942)
*Lucas Albarede,Jose Moreno,Lynda Tamine,Luce Lefeuvre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoDIT 是一种在 RAG 中联合生成和忠实地归因答案的方法，它通过利用生成过程中特定的 token logits 来估计每个文档对答案的贡献，并在 Trust-Align 基准测试中优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 仍然容易产生幻觉，这严重破坏了它们的可信度。以前的大部分工作都集中在解决答案和归因的正确性问题上，但最近的一项工作调查了忠实性，重点是利用内部模型信号来反映模型在生成答案时的实际决策过程。然而，这些方法会带来额外的延迟，并且在直接将 token 生成与归因生成对齐方面存在局限性。

Method: LoDIT，一种通过利用生成过程中特定 token logits 联合生成和忠实地归因答案的方法。

Result: LoDIT 在一个以可信度为中心的归因文本生成基准 Trust-Align 上进行的实验表明，LoDIT 在多个指标上显著优于最先进的模型。

Conclusion: LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于最先进的模型，并且在延迟方面高效，在不同设置中具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的伊斯兰裁决基准，发现LLM在不同语言和教派上的表现差异很大，强调在宗教应用中谨慎使用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在回答各种领域的问题中的使用越来越多，但它们在包括宗教领域在内的许多领域的可靠性和准确性仍未得到检验。

Method: 提出了一个新的基准FiqhQA，专注于LLM生成的伊斯兰教裁决，并明确地按四个主要的逊尼派思想流派进行分类，包括阿拉伯语和英语。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性方面优于所有其他模型，而Gemini和Fanar表现出卓越的弃权行为，这对于最大限度地减少自信的错误答案至关重要。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出显著的差异，并且在阿拉伯语中的性能下降，强调了在宗教应用中进行特定任务评估和谨慎部署LLM的必要性。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

*Anastasia Zhukova,Thomas Walton,Christian E. Matt,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于过程工业中班次日志记录链接的领域自适应CDCR模型，该模型优于现有的NLI和STS基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程工业中的知识管理 (KM) 对于优化运营、确保安全以及通过有效利用运营数据和过去的见解来实现持续改进至关重要。该领域的一个关键挑战是班次日志中事件日志的碎片化性质，其中相关的记录，例如记录与设备或流程相关的问题以及相应的解决方案的条目，可能仍然是断开连接的。这种碎片化阻碍了向用户推荐以前的解决方案。

Method: 通过将记录链接 (RL) 作为链接预测进行研究，将其构建为跨文档共指消解 (CDCR) 任务，并通过将其转移到因果推理 (CI) 来增强自然语言推理 (NLI) 和语义文本相似度 (STS)。

Result: 提出的记录链接 (RL) 模型优于最佳版本的 NLI 和 STS 驱动的基线，分别提高了 28%（11.43 点）和 27%（11.21 点）。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过推理能力增强的先进CDCR模型的领域自适应可以有效地适应过程工业，从而提高班次日志中的数据质量和连接性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and

of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM 是一个新的数学推理基准，可以抵抗训练集污染，结果表明现有模型存在记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型 (LLM) 的数学推理基准已接近饱和，某些模型的准确率达到 > 90%，并且越来越多地受到训练集污染的影响。

Method: 引入 Putnam-AXIOM，一个包含 522 道大学级别竞赛题的基准，以及 Putnam-AXIOM Variation，一个包含 100 个通过程序扰动变量和常量生成的函数变体的未见过的同伴集。

Result: 在原始数据集上，OpenAI 的 o1-preview 模型（最强的评估模型）得分为 41.9%，但在配对的 Variations 数据集上，其准确率下降了 19.6%（相对下降 46.8%）。其余 18 个模型也显示出同样的下降趋势，其中 10 个模型的 95% 置信区间不重叠。这些差距表明存在记忆，并突出了动态基准的必要性。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM 提供了一个严谨的、抗污染的评估框架，用于评估 LLM 的高级数学推理能力。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

TL;DR: CoDAE adapts LLMs for education by using Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to improve pedagogical guidance, reasoning support, and resistance to premature answer disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts.

Method: CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the augmented datasets

Result: Models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance, better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer disclosure.

Conclusion: Models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance, better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer disclosure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer

TL;DR: Mol-R1通过PRID和MoIA两种策略，提升了LLM在分子发现领域的推理能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）的能力有限且效率低下。分子发现需要精确理解领域知识，但分子数据的复杂性和高质量专家注释的稀缺性带来了挑战。

Method: Mol-R1，一个新颖的框架，旨在提高R1类显式长链思维（CoT）推理LLM在基于文本的分子生成中的可解释性和推理性能。它包括PRID和MoIA两种策略。

Result: Mol-R1在基于文本的分子推理生成任务中表现出卓越的性能，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1在基于文本的分子推理生成任务中表现出优于现有基线的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

*Saketh Reddy Vemula,Dipti Mishra Sharma,Parameswari Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 形态对齐对某些任务有帮助，但tokenizer算法更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前关于语言建模的工作显示，关于形态对齐的tokenization方法是否能提高性能，特别是在具有复杂形态的语言中，存在相互矛盾的发现。为了研究这一点，我们选择了一组类型多样的语言：Telugu（粘着语）、Hindi（主要是融合语，带有一些粘着语）和English（融合语）。

Method: 综合评估语言模型，从tokenizer训练开始，一直到微调和下游任务评估。为了解释在tokenizer变体中观察到的一致的性能差异，我们关注两个关键因素：形态对齐和tokenization质量。为了评估Telugu中tokenizers的形态对齐，我们创建了一个数据集，其中包含600个派生词和7000个屈折词的gold morpheme分词。

Result: 更好的词法对齐与基于语法的任务的性能呈正相关，tokenizer算法在影响下游任务性能方面起着更重要的作用，naive Unigram tokenizers在大多数设置中优于其他tokenizer，但在BPE框架内，结合了词法分割的混合tokenizers显著提高了性能。语料库token计数(CTC)和R'enyi熵等内部指标与下游性能没有相关性。

Conclusion: 更好的词法对齐与基于语法的任务（如词性标注、命名实体识别和依存关系解析）的性能呈正相关，但Tokenizer算法（Byte-pair Encoding vs. Unigram）在影响下游任务性能方面起着更重要的作用，naive Unigram tokenizers在大多数设置中优于其他tokenizer，但在BPE框架内，结合了词法分割的混合tokenizers显著提高了性能。语料库token计数(CTC)和R'enyi熵等内部指标与下游性能没有相关性。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Motivation: 小型大型语言模型(llm)在使输出与人类偏好保持一致方面经常面临困难，特别是在严重性能差距下运行时。

Method: 提出了两种基于DPO的轻量级变体——自适应Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero，通过引入基于边际的目标和选择性更新机制来更好地解决性能不佳的情况。

Result: APO-hinge-zero方法结合了hinge诱导的hard-example mining和以选择为中心的APO-zero优化，取得了较好的效果。在AlpacaEval中，与APO-zero基线相比，APO-hinge-zero的胜率提高了+2.0个百分点，长度控制的胜率提高了+1.4个百分点。在MT-Bench中，该方法在不同类别中保持了竞争性能，尤其是在STEM和人文科学任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 简单的偏好目标修改可以显著增强资源约束下的小型LLM对齐，为更高效的部署提供了实际路径。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在推理过程中隐藏状态的变化类似于物理学中的能量守恒。利用这一发现，我们提出了一种控制方法，可以提高模型的语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的内部隐藏状态在推理过程中如何逐个token地变化。

Method: 我们采用基于物理的方法来研究大型语言模型的内部隐藏状态在推理过程中如何逐个token地变化。

Result: 在20个开源transformer模型（1.35亿-30亿参数）中，我们发现一个结合了隐藏状态变化率和模型下一个token确定性的量，类似于物理学中的能量，几乎保持不变。随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持这种“能量”，而训练将模型转移到更快、更果断的机制，具有更大的可变性。使用这种“log-Lagrangian”视图，我们推导出一种称为 Jacobian steering 的控制方法，该方法以最小的方式扰动隐藏状态，以支持目标token。这种方法在两个测试模型中保持了近乎恒定的能量，并产生了在语义质量上高于模型自然输出的延续。

Conclusion: 通过力学角度观察transformers，为可解释性、异常检测和低风险steering提供了原则性基础。这有助于使强大的模型更可预测，并与人类意图对齐。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的 LLM 对齐方法，旨在捕捉不同的用户偏好，并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 目前使用强化学习等技术进行对齐，但这些方法使用标量奖励，只能反映用户的平均偏好。多元化对齐旨在捕捉一组属性中不同的用户偏好，而不仅仅是帮助性和无害性。

Method: 基于少样本比较回归的可操纵多元化模型

Result: 通过调整 Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) 和 HelpSteer2 数据集，提出了两个新的可操纵的多元化基准，证明了该方法在价值对齐决策和奖励建模中的适用性。提出的少样本比较回归方法是可解释的，并且与不同的属性和 LLM 兼容，同时优于多个基线方法和最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一个可操纵的多元化模型，该模型基于少样本比较回归，可以适应个人用户偏好。该方法优于多个基线方法和最先进的方法，为多元化对齐提供了新的见解和研究方向，从而能够更公平、更具代表性地使用 LLM，并提高了伦理 AI 的水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Conclusion: DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to

offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Conclusion:  interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: 由于注释数据有限和语言变异性，RAG系统（如Qwen3、DeepSeek和Kimi）在理解和生成真实的粤语口语表达方面面临挑战。

Method: 系统分析了使用各种LoRA变体、合成数据生成、用户反馈集成和自适应参数分配的最新研究。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA改编显著减少了可训练参数，而不会牺牲方言环境中的检索准确性和生成质量。但是，在完全保留细粒度的语言细微差别方面仍然存在限制，尤其是在像粤语这样的低资源环境中。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在特定领域语言任务中很有前景，但需要在方言真实性、动态适应和可扩展的微调流程方面进一步研究。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

TL;DR: InternBootcamp, a new framework, improves LLM reasoning through diverse tasks and automated evaluation, leading to performance gains via task scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world reasoning requires handling diverse environments that narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture.

Method: Introduces InternBootcamp, an open-source framework with automated generation of training/testing cases and integrated verification modules.

Result: Evaluation reveals frontier models underperform in many reasoning tasks, but training with InternBootcamp significantly improves performance.

Conclusion: Training with InternBootcamp improves performance, leading to a 32B model with state-of-the-art results. Task scaling offers a promising route towards capable reasoning generalist.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces IFRAgent, a framework that improves mobile-use agents by considering both explicit and implicit human intentions, leading to better performance in aligning with human intent and completing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods focus solely on the explicit intention flows of humans while neglecting implicit intention flows, which makes it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to evaluate the Intention Alignment Rate between mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect MobileIAR, a dataset containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions.

Method: We propose IFRAgent, a framework built upon Intention Flow Recognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query.

Result: IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an average of 6.79% (32.06% relative improvement) in human intention alignment rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30% (26.34% relative improvement).

Conclusion: IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an average of 6.79% in human intention alignment rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30%.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA
remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs
fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

TL;DR: TopXGen是一种基于LLM的方法，用于生成高质量和主题多样化的LRL数据，然后可以对其进行回译，以生成有用的和多样化的并行文本，用于ICL和微调，从而提高LLM翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在机器翻译(MT)中表现良好，通过使用上下文学习(ICL)，在翻译成高资源语言(hrl)时，可以与监督模型相媲美。然而，当翻译成低资源语言(lrl)时，它们就会落后。通过相似性搜索和监督微调的示例选择会有所帮助。然而，它们所带来的改进受到现有并行数据集的大小、质量和多样性的限制。低资源MT中的一个常用技术是合成并行数据创建，其中最常见的是回译，即现有的目标端文本被自动翻译成源语言。然而，这假设存在高质量和相关的目标端文本，而这对于许多lrl来说并不容易获得。

Method: 一种基于LLM的方法，用于生成高质量和主题多样化的多种LRL数据，然后可以对其进行回译，以生成有用的和多样化的并行文本，用于ICL和微调。

Result: 表明TopXGen提高了微调和上下文学习期间的LLM翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen提升了微调和上下文学习期间的LLM翻译性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck for voice-controlled interfaces in clinical contexts.

Method: Evaluating state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults interacting with the Welzijn.AI chatbot.

Result: Generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models; truncating existing architectures balances accuracy-speed, but some cases show high WER due to hallucinations.

Conclusion: Generic multilingual ASR models outperform fine-tuned models in recognizing speech of older Dutch adults.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token at a time, resulting in limited generation speed. There remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they improve inference performance.

Method: The authors categorize existing parallel text generation approaches into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of the core techniques within each category. They assess their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency.

Result: The authors present a systematic survey of parallel text generation methods.

Conclusion: This paper highlights recent advancements, identifies open challenges, and outlines promising directions for future research in parallel text generation.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Motivation: 现有方法存在肤浅的引出问题：LLM 只能被引导去模仿肤浅和不稳定的风格模式，无法像人类一样精确和一致地体现所需的特征。

Method: 提出 IROTE，一种用于稳定和可转移的特征引出的新型上下文方法。该方法自动生成并优化提示中的文本自我反思，包括自我感知的体验，以激发 LLM 的特征驱动行为。

Result: 在三个人类特征系统上进行的大量实验表明，一个 IROTE 生成的自我反思可以诱导 LLM 在各种下游任务中稳定地模仿目标特征，并且始终优于现有的强基线。

Conclusion: 一个 IROTE 生成的自我反思可以诱导 LLM 在各种下游任务中稳定地模仿目标特征，并且始终优于现有的强基线。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

TL;DR: Magical是一种不对称LoRA架构，专为异构数据场景下的MLLG量身定制，在三个真实世界的通俗语言生成数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 方法在多源异构医学通俗语言生成 (MLLG) 数据集上面临挑战，无法满足语义保真度和多样化通俗风格生成的要求。

Method: 不对称LoRA架构，采用共享矩阵 A 进行抽象概括，以及多个隔离矩阵 B 用于不同的通俗风格生成; 引入语义不变性约束以减轻矩阵 A 上的语义子空间偏移; 结合推荐引导开关，提示 LLM 在不同的矩阵 B 之间切换。

Result: 揭示了标准 LoRA 无法满足 MLLG 任务中对语义保真度和多样化通俗风格生成的要求。

Conclusion: Magical在三个真实世界的通俗语言生成数据集上始终优于基于提示的方法、vanilla LoRA 及其最新变体，同时将可训练参数减少了 31.66%。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

TL;DR: 提出了一个科学的Rerank导向的RAG基准(SciRerankBench)，用于评估RAG-llm中的reranker。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献问答是迈向新的科学发现的关键一步。最近，双阶段检索增强生成大型语言模型(RAG- llm)在该领域取得了令人印象深刻的进展。这种两阶段框架，特别是第二阶段(reranker)，在科学领域尤其重要，因为术语上的细微差别可能会对最终的面向事实或知识密集型答案产生很大的负面影响。尽管取得了显著的进展，但这些工作的潜力和局限性仍有待探索。

Method: 开发了一个科学的、面向Rerank的RAG基准(SciRerankBench)，用于评估RAG-llm中的reranker，跨越五个科学主题。为了严格评估reranker在噪声鲁棒性、相关性消除歧义和事实一致性方面的性能，我们开发了三种类型的question-context-answer (Q-C-A)对，即噪声上下文(NC)、语义相似但逻辑上不相关的上下文(SSLI)和反事实上下文(CC)。

Result: 通过对五个llm家族的13个广泛使用的reranker进行系统评估，我们详细了解了它们的相对优势和局限性。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是一个专门为评估RAG-LLM中reranker而开发的基准，为未来的发展提供了有价值的观察和指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Motivation: Manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into structured artifacts is a critical bottleneck in IT project governance.

Method: A Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system called DevNous is used to automate the translation process.

Conclusion: DevNous achieves high accuracy in translating unstructured team dialogue into structured artifacts, demonstrating its viability and establishing a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ARoG, a novel framework for privacy-protected RAG, which protects the privacy of entities in KGs by converting anonymous entities into retrievable information and retrieving question-relevant anonymous entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge. RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses significant privacy risks

Method: ARoG framework including relation-centric abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies.

Result: ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness on three datasets.

Conclusion: ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness.

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏专门为工具使用而设计的高效强化学习（RL）框架，这是由于构建稳定的训练环境和设计可验证的奖励机制方面存在挑战。

Method: 自动化环境构建管道，包含场景分解、文档生成、功能集成、复杂性缩放和本地化部署。此外，引入了一种可验证的奖励机制，该机制评估工具使用的精度和任务执行的完整性。

Result: 在不同规模的LLM上进行的实验表明，该方法显著提高了模型的使用工具性能，且不降低其通用能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了模型的使用工具性能，且不降低其通用能力，与推理模式或训练算法无关。分析表明，这些收益来自于改进的上下文理解和推理，这是由模型中较低层MLP参数的更新驱动的。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间感知的语言专家混合模型 TiMoE，通过模块化的时间分段预训练和因果路由，使大型语言模型在保持时间顺序的同时又不牺牲太多一般性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 通常在 Web 的固定快照上进行训练，这意味着它们的知识会变得过时，并且它们的预测有时间泄漏的风险：依赖于相对于查询而言位于未来的信息。

Method: 从头开始预训练一组 GPT 风格的专家，这些专家基于 2013-2024 年语料库中不相交的两年切片，并通过 TiMoE（一种时间感知的语言专家混合）将它们组合起来。

Result: 在八个标准 NLP 任务加上 TSQA 上的实验表明，共同适应的 TiMoE 变体匹配或超过了最佳单周期专家，并将未来知识错误减少了高达 15%。

Conclusion: 模块化的、时间分段的预训练与因果路由相结合，是使大型语言模型在保持时间顺序的同时又不牺牲太多一般性能的简单而有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型 (LLM) 中编码的偏见和刻板印象对于制定有效的缓解策略至关重要。偏见行为通常是微妙的且难以分离的，这使得系统分析和去偏见特别具有挑战性。

Method: BiasGym框架，包含BiasInject（通过token-based fine-tuning注入偏见）和BiasScope（识别负责偏见行为的组件）。

Conclusion: BiasGym通过注入和分析概念关联来减少 LLM 中的偏见，且不影响下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: intensive labor costs for senior doctors; the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias, the ability of senior doctors, and so on

Method: propose a Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores automatically by measuring the importance of revised spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by merging all revised span scores

Result: achieve competitive QA scores; the importance scores of revised spans can be also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Conclusion: Sqator can achieve competitive QA scores, and the importance scores of revised spans can be also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations impacts their cultural understanding is important, and prior work only performs extrinsic evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs' internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation.

Method: Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying cultural knowledge space. It utilizes a patching method to extract the cultural knowledge. A cultural flattening score is introduced as a measure of the intrinsic cultural biases.

Result: LLMs internalize Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening. Low-resource cultures are less susceptible to cultural biases.

Conclusion: LLMs encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural knowledge space. Low-resource cultures are less susceptible to cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. The work provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的规模和复杂性不断增加，带来了巨大的推理延迟挑战，这主要是由于其以next-token预测的顺序性质为特征的自回归解码范例。

Method: 提出了一种自适应串行-并行解码（ASPD）方法，该方法可以自动提取和验证来自自回归模型响应的可并行结构。实现了一个混合解码引擎，可以在串行和并行解码模式之间无缝转换，同时保持可重用的KV缓存，从而最大限度地提高计算效率。

Result: ASPD在有效性和效率方面都取得了前所未有的性能。在Vicuna Bench上，该方法实现了高达3.19倍的加速（平均1.85倍），同时与自回归模型相比，响应质量保持在1%的差异范围内。

Conclusion: ASPD在保持生成质量的同时，实现了显著的加速，为在延迟敏感型应用中部署高效的LLM并行推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

Motivation: Developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic complexity introduced by diverse dialects.

Method: A scalable training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised fine-tuning

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge.

Conclusion: Weak supervision paired with fine-tuning is effective in overcoming data scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich languages.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Motivation: 同时使用多种药物可能产生不利的健康影响，包括意外的副作用和相互作用。现有的药物相互作用（DDI）预测方法存在功能性motif表示学习有限的瓶颈，因为DDI从根本上是由motif相互作用引起的，而不是整体药物结构。

Method: ImageDDI将分子标记为功能性motif，并结合成一个序列，使用基于transformer的编码器进行嵌入，利用药物对之间的关联，使用全局分子图像信息增强分子的空间表示，并采用自适应特征融合。

Result: ImageDDI优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: ImageDDI在广泛使用的数据集上优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep

compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey

challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONN，通常由光学前端和数字后端组成）为实时、功率受限的系统提供了一种节能的替代方案，以替代全数字深度网络。然而，它们的采用受到两个主要挑战的限制：与训练期间的大型网络相比，精度差距；以及模拟系统和制造系统之间的差异，这进一步降低了精度。

Method: 提出了一种与任务无关且与硬件无关的流程，该流程支持跨各种光学系统的图像分类和分割。为了在训练前辅助光学系统设计，我们根据用户指定的约束（如物理尺寸和数据集）来估计可实现的模型精度。对于训练，我们引入了神经正切知识蒸馏 (NTKD)，它可以使光学模型与电子教师网络对齐，从而缩小精度差距。在制造后，NTKD 还可以指导数字后端微调，以补偿实施错误。

Result: 在多个数据集（例如，MNIST、CIFAR、Carvana Masking）和硬件配置上的实验表明，我们的流程能够持续提高 ONN 性能，并在预制仿真和物理实现中实现实际部署。

Conclusion: 该流程能够持续提高 ONN 性能，并在预制仿真和物理实现中实现实际部署。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Concurrent Object Layers (CObL), a diffusion-based architecture that generates a stack of object layers in parallel. It can reconstruct multiple occluded objects and generalizes to real-world tabletops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth.

Method: a diffusion-based architecture named Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and inference-time guidance

Result: it zero-shot generalizes to photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects.

Conclusion: CObL reconstructs multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number of objects beforehand, and it is not limited to the world it was trained in.

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型不擅长理解漫画中的长篇故事，尤其是在时间推理方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型 (VLM) 在处理连续视觉叙事时，在表面识别和深度叙事推理之间存在严重差距。

Method: 结合了细粒度的多模态注释、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估的新颖评估框架。

Result: 通过对漫画叙事理解的综合研究表明，虽然最近的大型多模态模型擅长个体面板解释，但它们在时间因果关系和跨面板凝聚力（连贯故事理解的核心要求）方面系统性地失败。

Conclusion: 当前的模型缺乏真正的故事理解能力，尤其是在非线性叙事、角色一致性和跨序列的因果推理方面表现不足。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现VLM行为控制的新方法，它比系统提示更有效，且不需要访问模型内部。然而，它也暴露了一个安全漏洞，即攻击者可以通过视觉通道操纵模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的行为控制或输出重定向方法（如VLMs中的系统提示）很容易被检测到且通常无效，而基于激活的引导向量需要对模型内部进行侵入式运行时访问——与基于API的服务和闭源部署不兼容。

Method: 提出了一种名为VISOR（基于视觉输入的输出重定向）的新方法，该方法仅通过优化的视觉输入来实现复杂的行为控制。通过制作诱导目标激活模式的通用引导图像，VISOR可以在所有VLM服务模式中实现实际部署，同时与显式文本指令相比仍然难以察觉。

Result: 在三个关键的对齐任务（拒绝、奉承和生存本能）上验证了VISOR在LLaVA-1.5-7B上的性能。单个150KB的引导图像在正面行为转变方面与引导向量的性能匹配在1-2%以内，而在负面引导方面则大大超过它——与引导向量的适度变化相比，实现了高达25%的基线转变。与系统提示（3-4%的转变）不同，VISOR提供了强大的双向控制，同时在14,000个不相关的MMLU任务上保持了99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR揭示了一种严重的安全漏洞：攻击者可以通过视觉通道实现复杂的行为操纵，绕过基于文本的防御。这项工作从根本上重新构想了多模态模型控制，并强调了迫切需要防御视觉引导攻击。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the data scarcity challenge in transcribing Kindai documents by using parallel textline images and a distance-based objective function to improve OCR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcribing Kindai documents is labor-intensive and time-consuming, resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition (OCR) systems.

Method: This research introduces a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between self-attention features of the parallel image pairs, exploring Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation metrics.

Result: The proposed method reduces the character error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method reduces the character error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively, and improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling, uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set.

Method: Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token.

Result: Across CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under 0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature scaling.

Conclusion: CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy.

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generic framework, DTLP-Net, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that addresses limited annotation and domain shift challenges by generating reliable pseudo-labels using diverse teacher models and label propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges in medical image segmentation, leading to scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are tailored to specific tasks in isolation, hindering the effective utilization of unlabeled data.

Method: A Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) with a single student model and two diverse teacher models is employed to generate reliable pseudo-labels. Inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation are used, and label propagation is proposed to enhance model robustness.

Result: The proposed framework was evaluated on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks, showing notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DTLP-Net framework achieves notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks, demonstrating its potential for tackling more challenging SSL scenarios.

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLIPNET, a unified network that addresses the gap between vanilla diffusion models and blind face restoration (BFR) by switching between Restoration and Degradation modes. It achieves superior performance in both face restoration and real-world degradation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2) synthesized and real-world images.

Method: a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes

Result: outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of authenticity and fidelity, and outperforms the naive degradation model in modeling the real-world degradations.

Conclusion: The model outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of authenticity and fidelity, and outperforms the naive degradation model in modeling the real-world degradations.

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

TL;DR: AutoSAME结合SAM进行左心室分割和地标定位，优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且VFMs不擅长识别关键解剖点。

Method: 结合SAM的强大视觉理解能力与分割和地标定位任务，并提出过滤跨分支注意力（FCBA）和空间引导提示对齐（SGPA）。

Result: 在超声心动图数据集上的大量实验证明了每个设计的效率以及AutoSAME的优越性。

Conclusion: AutoSAME在左心室分割、地标定位和指标测量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用超类信息减少对虚假特征依赖的方法，无需额外注释即可在领域泛化中实现鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究通常依赖于组或虚假特征的辅助注释，并假设源域和目标域中存在相同的组集合，这两个要求在现实环境中既不自然也不实用。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种利用类标签中固有的语义结构（特别是超类信息）来自然地减少对虚假特征的依赖的方法。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉-语言模型引导的基于梯度的注意力来解开超类相关和不相关的特征。通过促进使用所有超类相关特征进行预测，来实现对更复杂的虚假相关性的鲁棒性，而无需注释任何源样本。

Result: 该方法在各种数据集上的实验表明，其在领域泛化任务中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在领域泛化任务中显著优于基线，定量指标和定性可视化方面均有明显改进。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: 该方法在元素控制和整体视频质量方面均达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Conclusion: DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，同时产生了更易于解释和人类理解的推理步骤。研究结果表明，强化学习是增强基于MLLM的文档理解的可解释性和适应性的强大替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中实现了最先进的性能和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

TL;DR: TransMiter是一种轻量级适配器，无需反向传播即可改进视觉-语言模型，从而实现高效的知识转移和泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉-语言模型(VLM)具有显著的泛化能力，因此被广泛应用于各种视觉识别任务。由于这些模型的大小和复杂性不断增长，微调的成本变得很高，因此需要重用来自“较弱”模型的适应知识，以有效地增强“较强”的模型。然而，现有的适应转移方法由于其模型特定的设计和高计算需求，表现出有限的跨模型可转移性。

Method: 我们提出了可迁移的、与模型无关的适配器(TransMiter)，这是一个轻量级的适配器，可以在“没有反向传播”的情况下改进视觉-语言模型。

Result: 实验结果和分析表明，TransMiter有效地且高效地传递了适应知识，同时在视觉识别任务中，保留了不同大小和架构的VLM之间的泛化能力。此外，用少量标记数据补充该过程会进一步产生额外的性能增益，通常超过微调的更强模型，而训练成本却很小。

Conclusion: TransMiter有效地且高效地传递了适应知识，同时在视觉识别任务中，保留了不同大小和架构的VLM之间的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和真实的手持视频数据集上都显著优于现有的自监督方法。

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: HVPL model addresses catastrophic forgetting in video instance segmentation by using hierarchical visual prompts and orthogonal gradient correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume fixed object instance categories and suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new categories.

Method: A novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model with task-specific frame and video prompts, an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module, and a video context decoder.

Result: The HVPL model overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives.

Conclusion: The HVPL model is more effective than baseline approaches in video instance segmentation.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的知识蒸馏方法AME，它可以在低数据情况下实现鲁棒的知识蒸馏，并且可以作为即插即用模块与各种视觉语言蒸馏框架兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言知识蒸馏通常需要足够的训练数据才能在具有模糊或边界相邻表示的样本上实现鲁棒的泛化，这与高预测不确定性相关。收集用于训练的此类大规模、特定于任务的数据在现实场景中通常是不切实际的。

Method: Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME)，在重构的共享流形上应用熵最小化，其中多模态数据（即图像和文本）通过一对投影函数桥接，有利于跨模态特征表示的结构压缩。

Result: 理论分析表明，将知识蒸馏与共享流形上的熵最小化相结合，可以得到更严格的泛化误差界。

Conclusion: AME在各种蒸馏架构和训练设置中持续促进鲁棒的知识蒸馏，从而在各种下游任务中产生卓越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Result: 在具有挑战性的心脏和腹部数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在两种设置中都取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该框架在两个设置中都取得了最先进的结果，无源性能接近其源可访问的对应性能。

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

TL;DR: PADReg is a physics-aware ultrasound registration method using contact force to improve anatomical alignment and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound deformable registration is crucial for capturing biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy, but it's challenging due to low contrast, noise, and ambiguous boundaries, leading to poor alignment and lack of physical interpretability in existing methods.

Method: PADReg, a physics-aware deformable registration framework guided by contact force, constructs a pixel-wise stiffness map utilizing multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images, then estimates a dense deformation field through a physics-aware module inspired by Hooke's law.

Result: PADReg attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34% better than state-of-the-art methods on in-vivo datasets.

Conclusion: PADReg achieves physically plausible registration with better anatomical alignment and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 21.34% improvement in HD95.

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and LiDAR data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new video banding dataset and a new no-reference video quality evaluator (CBAND) that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Banding artifacts remain a serious issue affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of high-definition videos. Existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs.

Method: The authors created a first-of-its-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. They collected a total of 7,200 subjective opinions from 45 human subjects. The authors tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. They introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which they call CBAND, which leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks.

Result: The perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster.

Conclusion: The authors created a new NR video quality evaluator called CBAND, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of banding prediction performance and speed. CBAND can also be used as a differentiable loss function to optimize video debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are publicly available.

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different

opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)

prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video

Motivation: 由于语义子群体代表性不足，用于视觉识别的深度学习模型经常表现出系统性错误。虽然现有的调试框架可以通过识别关键失败属性来查明这些失败，但有效修复模型仍然很困难。目前的解决方案通常依赖于手动设计的提示来生成合成训练图像——这种方法容易出现分布偏移和语义错误。

Conclusion: 通过使用这种罕见案例增强的合成数据集重新训练视觉模型，我们显著减少了与罕见案例相关的错误。实验表明，这种有针对性的修复策略提高了模型的鲁棒性，而没有引入新的错误。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Motivation: Existing deep segmentation networks treat all pixels equally, ignoring the inhomogeneous nature of lens structure sub-regions and the poor segmentation calibration at boundaries. Clinical experts annotate lens structures with varying confidence levels based on sub-region proportions, ambiguous boundaries, and shapes.

Method: An Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss is proposed to group lens structure sub-regions into different confidence levels, along with an adaptive confidence threshold optimization algorithm. A new metric, Boundary Expected Calibration Error (BECE), is introduced to quantify miscalibration errors in boundary region segmentation.

Result: ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods, achieving a 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction in lens structure segmentation under U-Net.

Conclusion: The ACW loss outperforms existing segmentation methods, improving IoU, DSC, and reducing BECE in lens structure segmentation.

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种框架，该框架通过模拟社交网络的视频共享管道来弥合基于实验室的训练和实际部署之间的深度伪造检测器之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交网络上，人工智能生成的视频日益普及，这对深度伪造检测提出了新的挑战，因为在受控条件下训练的检测器通常无法推广到实际场景。造成这种差距的一个关键因素是YouTube和Facebook等平台采用的激进的专有压缩技术，这些平台会篡改低级别的取证线索。然而，由于API的限制和数据共享的限制，大规模复制这些转换是困难的。

Method: 通过估计一小组上传视频的压缩和调整大小参数，来模拟社交网络的视频共享管道。

Result: 在通过社交网络共享的FaceForensics++视频上进行的实验表明，我们模拟的数据与真实上传的降级模式非常匹配。此外，在模拟视频上进行微调的检测器，其性能与在实际共享媒体上训练的检测器相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案，用于弥合基于实验室的训练和深度伪造检测器的实际部署之间的差距，尤其是在压缩视频内容的未开发领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

Notably, a lightweight CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in occasional errors.

Conclusion: ROOMELSA establishes a new benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems by bridging the gap between scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval.

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Method: 该方法将姿势估计重新 формулирует 为扩散模型的生成框架下的去噪过程，并利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 提取全局解剖先验和基于物种特定提示的局部关键点语义。

Result: 在各种动物姿势数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在各种物种、杂乱的背景和不完整的关键点等具有挑战性的场景下，具有有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一种名为DiffPose-Animal的新型基于扩散的框架，用于自上而下的动物姿势估计，并在公共动物姿势数据集上进行了广泛的实验，证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform

TL;DR: MonoPartNeRF, a new framework for monocular dynamic human rendering, ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery by using a bidirectional deformation model, part-based pose embedding, and a learnable appearance code. It outperforms existing methods under complex conditions.


<details>

Motivation: Existing part-based NeRF methods struggle with complex pose variations, producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings.

Method: A novel framework called MonoPartNeRF is proposed, which includes a bidirectional deformation model, a part-based pose embedding mechanism, and a learnable appearance code.

Result: The MonoPartNeRF method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MonoPartNeRF method outperforms existing approaches in monocular dynamic human rendering, especially under complex pose and occlusion conditions, achieving better joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

*Luis S. Luevano,Pavel Korshunov,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose a method to synthesize aged and de-aged faces by editing the latent space of StyleGAN2, ensuring identity preservation. They also generated a dataset of synthetic faces for benchmarking age-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models (VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs, and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity preservation is rarely taken into account or evaluated on a single face recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face.

Method: The authors propose to synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems, the authors empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2 latent space.

Result: The authors propose a simple yet practical formula for estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity preservation for a given input face.

Conclusion: The authors generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems, or systems for detection of synthetic images.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: This paper proposes a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm to address the misalignment between class representations and image features in semantic segmentation, achieving improved performance with negligible parameters on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel classification paradigm.  Image pixel features should not vary for the same category in different images.

Method: propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

Result: offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters required on the ADE20K dataset. demonstrate consistent improvements with negligible parameters on four datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context.

Conclusion: The proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters required.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M

TL;DR: TARA通过token mask和空间注意力对齐，解决了多LoRA模块组合时身份丢失和特征泄漏的问题，实现了高效且保真的多概念图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当结合多个LoRA模块进行多概念生成时，经常导致身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏。我们确定了这些失败背后的两个关键问题：(1)不同LoRA模块之间的token-wise干扰，以及(2)稀有token的注意力图与其相应的概念特定区域之间的空间错位。

Method: 提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，引入token mask来显式地约束每个模块专注于其相关的稀有token以避免干扰，并提出了一个训练目标，鼓励稀有token的空间注意力与其概念区域对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，TARA能够通过直接注入多个独立训练的TARA模块在推理时实现免训练的多概念组合。

Conclusion: TARA通过避免LoRA模块之间的相互干扰，实现了高效的多概念推理，并有效保留了每个概念的视觉特征。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Motivation: 提出了一种用于无参考图像质量评估 (NR-IQA) 的新框架。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于方向图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估 (NR-IQA) 框架。定义了一种各向异性纹理丰富度 (ATR) 的度量，它使用两个可调阈值（每个允许一个，一个限制）来量化正交纹理抑制，在像素级别计算。

Result: 在组合数据集上，完整系统预测的人类评分为 R2 = 0.892，均方根误差 (RMSE) 为 5.17 DMOS 点。对于高斯模糊，Spearman 相关性约为 -0.93，对于 LIVE 数据集上的白噪声，Spearman 相关性约为 -0.95。该系统利用来自两个专业 ATR 配置的签名来对主要伪影类型（模糊与噪声）进行分类，准确率超过 97%。

Conclusion: 该框架是一个强大的双重用途工具，用于图像退化的分类和量化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应高频预处理，在提升主观质量的同时节省了视频编码的比特率，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的视觉效果和比特率节省。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

### [94] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel categorical generative AI architectures (GAIAs) using topos theory, demonstrating that the category of LLMs forms a topos and defining a potential implementation of an LLM topos architecture using a functorial characterization of backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explore novel architectures for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as functions, forms a topos

Method: use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular, these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential objects, and subobject classifiers

Result: the category of LLMs is (co)complete, meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits

Conclusion: The category of LLMs forms a topos, a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential objects as well as subobject classifiers. A functorial characterization of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos architecture.

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [95] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces topos causal models (TCMs) and shows their properties are central to many applications in causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are central to many applications in causal inference.

Method: topos causal models (TCMs)

Result: the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit

Conclusion: TCMs form a topos, they admit an internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using this internal logic.

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种方法，通过利用问题实例中相似的适应度景观，结合多目标算法和目标规划来高效解决多目标问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用需要决策者在考虑多个相互冲突的目标时评估解决方案的质量。即使对于现代多目标算法，为高度约束的多目标问题获得良好的近似集通常也是一项艰巨的任务。在某些情况下，问题场景的多个实例在其适应度景观中呈现出相似性。

Method: 通过使用计算量大的多目标算法解决给定问题场景的一个实例以获得良好的近似集，然后使用具有高效单目标算法的目标规划来解决同一问题场景的其他实例，从而利用这一特性。

Result: 在具有时间窗的多目标车辆路径问题的基准实例上，该方法能够在短时间内产生良好的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了最先进的多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的效率，可以在实例具有相似适应度景观的问题场景中找到良好的折衷解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Motivation: The specification of prior distributions and likelihoods requires specialized statistical expertise, which is a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference.

Method: LLM-BI, a conceptual pipeline for automating Bayesian workflows. Two experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression were conducted.

Result: LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from natural language. LLM can specify the entire model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single high-level problem description.

Conclusion: LLMs have the potential to automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling an automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single

automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FATA通过先提问后回答的方式，提高了LLM在信息不完整情况下的回复质量和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户提供的信息不完整或不明确时，大型语言模型（LLM）通常难以提供准确且可操作的答案。

Method: 通过提示词引导LLM在生成回复之前主动为用户生成多维补充问题，然后通过复杂的提示技术将用户提供的补充信息与原始查询集成。

Result: FATA优于B-Prompt，并且表现出比C-Prompt更优越的稳定性。

Conclusion: FATA在综合指标上比B-Prompt高出约40%，变异系数比C-Prompt低8%，表明其具有更优越的稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Conclusion: current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation

TL;DR: UrzaGPT是一个用于万智牌自动组牌的领域自适应大型语言模型，通过微调小型LLM，在选牌准确率上超过了零样本LLM，证明了LLM在CCG组牌方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI模型在集换式卡牌游戏的组牌和游戏玩法等任务中表现远不如人类玩家，因为CCG具有部分可观察性、长期决策和不断发展的卡牌集等特点。

Method: 使用低秩适应微调（Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning）在注释的选牌日志数据集上对领域自适应的大型语言模型UrzaGPT进行训练。

Result: UrzaGPT在Magic: The Gathering的实时选牌决策中达到了66.2%的准确率，优于零样本LLM，但低于特定领域的模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在集换式卡牌游戏（CCG）的自动组牌方面有潜力，虽然目前性能不如特定领域的模型，但未来可实现高性能、通用且易于更新的AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [101] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bilevel modification to MCTS and Tree Collapsing to improve the runtime complexity of node selection in classical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One weakness of MCTS is that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently limited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go).

Method: a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to d, which achieves amortized O(1) runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an enhancement that reduces action selection steps

Result: achieves amortized O(1) runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the performance.

In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the performance.

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily

selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we

*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to improve the compilation of constraint modelling languages by using a solver to compute only the necessary combinations of induction variables, resulting in faster compilation without changing the final model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are ultimately irrelevant.

Method: a method that avoids full enumeration by using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final set of constraints

Result: compilation can be significantly faster. This improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with selective preconditions.

Conclusion: The resulting model is identical to that produced by conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster.

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final

*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill optimizes LLM inference by decoupling prefill and decode stages, using a full model for prefill and a pruned model for decode, achieving better performance with less latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs and latency issues in large language models (LLMs) due to the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode stages.

Method: OverFill decouples prefill and decode stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. It uses a full model for prefill and switches to a dense pruned model for sequential token generation.

Result: OverFill outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2% (3B-to-1B configuration) and improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% (8B-to-3B configuration) on average across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: OverFill matches the performance of same-sized models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a GRASP metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP), achieving strong results in the MESS 2024 competition and outperforming Gurobi on synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP), which extends the classical TSP by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific trigger arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with compactable storage systems.

Method: The paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators.

Result: Computational experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps of 0.77% and 0.40% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced solutions 11.3% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.

Conclusion: The algorithm's top-three finish in the MESS 2024 competition highlights its potential for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel costs.

TL;DR: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives, but these methods collect the wrong kind of data.

To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000 cardinal judgments


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: identifying a fundamental limitation: these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result: no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover the most preferred model.

Method: collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000 cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations

Result: selecting the optimal model requires recovering preferences over models, which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response quality

Conclusion: incorporating cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream benchmarks

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-quality correspondences in ontology alignment remains challenging, and while human-in-the-loop is essential for accuracy, it is expensive, especially with large ontologies.

Method: The study involves evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs using different ontology-driven prompt templates on several matching tasks from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). The LLM results are compared against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

Result: The paper presents an extensive evaluation of several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate uncertain correspondences in ontology alignment, offering a potential alternative to expensive human experts.

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型(llm)的推理和解决问题的能力。

Method: GVGAI-LLM：一个基于通用视频游戏AI框架的视频游戏基准，使用游戏描述语言快速创建新游戏和关卡，并使用ASCII字符表示游戏场景。

Result: 通过对具有不同挑战和技能深度的广泛游戏和关卡的零样本评估，揭示了llm在空间推理和基本规划方面的持续局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出空间和逻辑错误，需要结构化提示和空间基础技术。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私法规，对真实世界医疗数据的访问通常受到限制，这对医疗保健研究的进步构成了重大障碍。合成数据提供了一种有希望的替代方案；然而，生成真实的、临床上有效的和具有隐私意识的记录仍然是一个主要的挑战。大型语言模型 (LLM) 的最新进展为结构化数据生成提供了新的机会；然而，现有方法经常缺乏系统的提示策略和全面的多维度评估框架。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and

LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and

Method: A novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework tailored specifically for EHR datasets.

Result: The framework effectively manages sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse healthcare contexts. It guides physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features within budget constraints.

Conclusion: The study introduces a personalized, online, and cost-aware feature selection framework for EHR data, designed to enhance diagnostic confidence and optimize resource use in patient screening.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在推理方面取得了显著进展，但常常在复杂的多模态任务中表现不佳，并且倾向于生成过于冗长的输出。一个关键的限制是它们依赖于链式思考（CoT）推理，尽管许多任务受益于像树或图这样的替代拓扑结构。

Method: 提出了STELAR-Vision，一个拓扑感知推理的训练框架，核心是TopoAug合成数据管道，使用监督微调和强化学习对Qwen2VL模型进行后训练，并提出了Frugal Learning。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，STELAR-Vision比其基础模型提高了9.7%的准确率，超过了更大的Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct 7.3%。在五个分布外基准测试中，它优于Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct高达28.4%，优于LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct高达13.2%。与Chain-Only训练相比，该方法在分布内数据集上的总体准确率提高了4.3%，并且在所有OOD基准测试中始终优于。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision在多个基准测试中显著提高了准确性和泛化能力，尤其是在分布外数据集上，并且通过Frugal Learning减少了输出长度。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%

Motivation: Existing agent implementations are scenario-tailored, lacking a unified framework, which limits their ability to generalize across different social contexts and produce consistent, realistic behaviors.

Method: The paper introduces a theory-informed framework grounded in principles from Social Cognition Theory, with three key modules: motivation, action planning, and learning.

Result: The proposed agents achieve up to 75% lower deviation from real-world behavioral data compared to classical generative baselines. Removing key modules increases errors by 1.5 to 3.2 times.

Conclusion: The proposed theory-driven agents reproduce realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75% lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a memory-augmented AR agent framework to improve personalized task assistance by learning from user experiences in spatiotemporal contexts. It outlines the framework's modules, implementation, evaluation, and potential applications, aiming to motivate research in intelligent AR systems.


<details>

They aim for this work to motivate future research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs acquire vast knowledge that can become outdated or inaccurate, and retraining is computationally expensive. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative.

Method: This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy to provide a more holistic view of knowledge editing. It examines how different mechanisms apply to various knowledge types.

Result: The survey maps the current landscape, outlines the strengths and limitations of existing methods, defines the problem formally, and surveys evaluation tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: This survey concludes with open challenges and future directions in knowledge editing for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being

### [121] [GRainsaCK: a Comprehensive Software Library for Benchmarking Explanations of Link Prediction Tasks on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08815)
*Roberto Barile,Claudia d'Amato,Nicola Fanizzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRainsaCK, a software resource for benchmarking explanations in link prediction for Knowledge Graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully, evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.

Method: proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations

Result: GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced. Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a tutorial.

Conclusion: We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations, i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same evaluation protocol.

*Yuechen Wang,Yuming Qiao,Dan Meng,Jun Yang,Haonan Lu,Zhenyu Yang,Xudong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E-Agent通过动态编排多模态工具和优化mRAG工作流程，提高了多模态检索增强生成(mRAG)的性能，并在RemPlan基准测试中表现出优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常存在检索策略僵化和视觉信息利用不足的问题。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了E-Agent。

Method: E-Agent采用一次性mRAG规划策略，实现高效信息检索，同时最大限度地减少冗余工具调用。E-Agent具有两个关键创新：一个mRAG规划器，经过训练可以根据上下文推理动态协调多模态工具；以及一个任务执行器，采用工具感知执行排序来实现优化的mRAG工作流程。

Result: E-Agent在RemPlan和三个已建立的基准测试中表现出色：与最先进的mRAG方法相比，准确率提高了13%，同时减少了37%的冗余搜索。

Conclusion: E-Agent在RemPlan和三个已建立的基准测试中表现出色：与最先进的mRAG方法相比，准确率提高了13%，同时减少了37%的冗余搜索。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

*Mustafa Akben,Vinayaka Gude,Haya Ajjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs outperform humans in emotion recognition tests individually, but human collective intelligence and human-AI collaboration are superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely unexplored.

Method: This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.

Result: MLLMs outperform humans in accurately identifying emotions across both tests. Human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM predictions. A collaborative approach achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

Conclusion: MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual level, but the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional AI.

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

### [124] [Reducing Cognitive Load in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Problem Solving: Decoupling Reasoning and Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08882)
*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个双智能体框架，以减少数学推理中的认知负荷干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统通常采用单智能体模式，其中一个大型语言模型在集成的工作流程中处理问题推理、代码生成和代码执行。虽然这种设计简化了协调，但我们假设它会带来认知负荷干扰，因为智能体必须将长程推理与精确的程序合成交错进行。

Method: 结合模仿学习和强化学习进行训练：代码智能体因匹配中间真实程序而获得强奖励，而因有效执行而获得较弱的奖励，而推理智能体主要通过最终答案的准确性进行优化，使用优势估计来评估中间步骤。

Result: 推理+代码智能体产生的正确推理路径明显更少，尽管具有工具调用能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一个双智能体混合框架，其中推理智能体执行逐步问题分解，代码智能体处理代码生成和执行。这种解耦的角色设计减少了认知干扰，并促进了稳定的推理-编码协调。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接在超大规模模型上进行强化学习实验成本高、资源需求大，风险高。

Method: 通过专门设计的强化学习管道，使用 30k 可验证的数学问题数据集训练 Compass-Thinker-7B。

Result: Compass-Thinker-7B 具有卓越的推理潜力，并且在数学方面实现了优于相同大小的 RL 模型的性能。

Conclusion: Compass-Thinker-7B 在数学问题上表现出色，尤其是在 AIME2024 评估中达到 40% 的准确率。

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

TL;DR: LVLMs have safety vulnerabilities with multimodal inputs. The SSUI dataset helps mitigate these implicit reasoning threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal inputs, specifically Implicit Reasoning Safety.

Method: Developed Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations (SSUI) dataset.

Result: Demonstrates that benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due to flawed or hidden reasoning.

Conclusion: In-Context Learning with SSUI significantly mitigates implicit multimodal threats.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了前景理论和认知标记对LLM决策行为的影响，发现前景理论对LLM的适用性并不总是可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨前景理论是否适用于当代大型语言模型，以及表达人类不确定性的认知标记是否会影响其决策行为。

Method: 设计了一个基于经济问卷的三阶段实验。提出了一个更通用和精确的评估框架来模拟LLM在PT下的决策行为，通过与可比较的上下文中常用的认知标记相关的经验概率值来引入不确定性。然后，基于其相应的概率值将认知标记纳入评估框架，以检查它们对LLM决策行为的影响。

Result: 建模LLM的决策与PT并不总是可靠的

Conclusion: 建模LLM的决策与PT并不总是可靠，尤其是在不确定性以不同的语言形式表达时。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多智能体框架，通过结构化的agent-specific记忆来解决上下文窗口限制，实验表明，该方法在PDDL数据集和复杂数据管道设计任务上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大型语言模型（LLM）构建的多智能体系统在复杂的协作问题解决方面显示出卓越的潜力，但它们面临着源于上下文窗口限制的基本挑战，这些限制损害了记忆一致性、角色坚持和程序完整性。

Method: 引入了内在记忆代理，这是一种新颖的框架，它通过随着代理输出内在演变的结构化代理特定记忆来解决这些限制。具体来说，我们的方法保持角色对齐的记忆模板，这些模板保留了专业的视角，同时专注于与任务相关的信息。

Result: 在PDDL数据集上，与现有的最先进的多智能体记忆方法相比，性能提高了38.6％，并且具有最高的令牌效率。在复杂的数据管道设计任务上进行了额外的评估，证明我们的方法在比较5个指标（可扩展性、可靠性、可用性、成本效益和文档）时，可以产生更高质量的设计，并提供改进的额外定性证据。

Conclusion: 解决记忆限制可以通过结构化的内在方法来提高多智能体LLM系统在结构化规划任务中的能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种通过识别和主动缓解模型内部工作中的偏差来构建更安全和更负责任的法学硕士的端到端系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）越来越融入社会系统，它们延续和放大有害偏见的风险成为一个关键的安全问题。传统的缓解偏见的方法通常依赖于数据过滤或事后输出调节，这些方法将模型视为不透明的黑匣子。

Method: 首先，我们对模型的内部激活训练线性“探针”，以检测各种偏差的潜在表示（例如，性别、种族、年龄）。其次，我们通过对比模型对有偏差和中性语句的激活模式来计算“引导向量”。通过在推理过程中添加这些向量，我们可以积极地引导模型的生成过程，使其远离产生有害、刻板或有偏差的内容。

Result: 我们在 \{gpt2-large} 上的实验表明，这些探针可以近乎完美地识别有偏差的内容，揭示偏差表示在模型的后期层中变得最为显着。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个完整、端到端的系统，该系统利用来自机制可解释性的技术来识别和积极地缓解模型内部工作中的偏差，并且展示了激活引导技术的有效性，表明它可以成功地将有偏差的补全改变为更中性的替代方案。我们提出的工作是一个强大且可重复的系统，它提供了一种更直接和可解释的方法来构建更安全和更负责任的法学硕士。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究网约车系统中预请求乘客等待时间的可预测性和可解释性，并通过 FiXGBoost 模型实现了高性能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预请求等待时间预测使乘客能够更有效地规划行程，并提升乘客和司机的体验。然而，现有的研究尚未充分研究它。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于特征交互的 XGBoost 模型 FiXGBoost，用于在不知道分配的司机信息的情况下预测等待时间。

Result: FiXGBoost 在大规模真实世界网约车数据集上取得了良好的预请求乘客等待时间预测性能。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost 模型在预请求乘客等待时间预测方面表现良好，并具有很高的可解释性。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning approach for early detection of anomalies in railway track circuits, improving maintenance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early identification of failure types in track circuits is essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue loss. Conventional approaches struggle to detect subtle anomalies early.

Method: A predictive maintenance framework leveraging deep neural networks is used to classify anomalies.

Result: The method achieves 99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset and provides uncertainty estimates through conformal prediction, reaching 99% confidence with consistent coverage across classes.

Conclusion: The proposed deep neural network framework enhances operational reliability by accurately classifying anomalies in CVCM track circuits well before they escalate into failures. The approach is scalable, adaptable, and ISO-17359 compliant.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的来源感知成员审计 (SMA) 方法，用于解决 RAG 和 MRAG 系统中内容来源追溯问题，实现了对生成内容的细粒度来源归属。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成 (RAG) 及其多模态检索增强生成 (MRAG) 通过引入外部知识源，显著提高了大型语言模型 (LLM) 的知识覆盖范围和上下文理解能力。然而，检索和多模态融合模糊了内容来源，使得现有的成员推理方法无法可靠地将生成的输出归因于预训练、外部检索或用户输入，从而损害了隐私泄露责任。

Method: 该方法设计了一种基于零阶优化的归因估计机制，通过大规模扰动采样和岭回归建模来稳健地近似输入 tokens 对输出的真实影响。此外，SMA 引入了一种跨模态归因技术，通过 MLLM 将图像输入投影到文本描述中，从而在文本模态中实现 token 级别的归因，这首次促进了 MRAG 系统中图像检索痕迹的成员推理。

Result: SMA 实现了对生成内容的细粒度来源归属，并首次促进了 MRAG 系统中图像检索痕迹的成员推理。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的来源感知成员审计 (SMA) 方法，该方法能够对具有检索控制功能的半黑盒环境中的生成内容进行细粒度的来源归属，从而能够审计复杂生成系统中的数据来源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Conclusion: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified上达到了34.8%的平均成功率，超越了OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o)，确立了新的开源模型技术水平。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的框架BrowseMaster，它围绕一个程序增强的规划器-执行器代理对构建。

Result: BrowseMaster在具有挑战性的英语和中文基准测试中始终优于开源和专有基线。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂的、推理密集型的信息搜寻任务中表现出色，在BrowseComp-en和BrowseComp-zh上分别达到了30.0和46.5的分数，超过了现有的模型。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Fier: A fine-grained and efficient KV cache retrieval method using 1-bit quantized keys to improve long-context LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache reading latency increases significantly with context lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. Important tokens are often sparsely distributed across the long context, making existing page-level KV retrieval inaccurate.

Method: Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.

Result: Fier matches full KV performance using only 11% of the cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by 1.2x to 1.5x.

Conclusion: Fier matches full KV performance using only 11% of the cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by 1.2x to 1.5x.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context
lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address
this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的关系数据库预测建模框架SRP，它通过新的检索机制充分捕获关系数据库中的一元和复合依赖关系，从而增强表格数据预测的感受野。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库 (RDB) 已成为存储海量和异构数据的行业标准。然而，尽管 RDB 在各个领域得到广泛使用，但关系数据库的固有结构阻碍了它们从蓬勃发展的深度学习方法中受益的能力。以前的研究主要集中在使用主键-外键关系来利用关系数据库中多个表之间的一元依赖关系，要么将多个表连接成一个表，要么在它们之间构建一个图，这使得不同表之间的隐式复合关系以及预测建模的大量改进潜力未被探索。

Method: 本文提出了一种统一的预测建模框架SRP，该框架利用一元依赖关系合成特征，检索相关信息以捕获复合依赖关系，并在构建的图上传播消息以学习相邻模式，从而在关系数据库上进行预测。

Result: 通过在 RDB 中引入一种新的检索机制，SRP 旨在充分捕获关系数据库中的一元和复合依赖关系，从而增强表格数据预测的感受野。此外，我们对 SRP 的组件进行了全面分析，从而细致地理解了模型行为，并为未来的应用提供了实用的指导。

Conclusion: SRP在五个真实世界数据集上的大量实验证明了其有效性以及在工业场景中的潜在适用性。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跨栈方法，通过优化算法、系统和硬件，来提高复杂ML系统的效率，重点关注RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统日益复杂，集成了模型之外的组件（如RAG），且摩尔定律的终结使得系统效率的提升必须考虑硬件发展。

Method: 论文提出了PipeRAG、RAGO、Chameleon、FANNS、Falcon、MicroRec和FleetRec等方法，分别针对RAG serving效率、向量搜索和推荐系统的serving效率进行了优化。

Result: 论文通过算法、系统和硬件层面的优化，提高了ML系统的效率，特别是在RAG serving、向量搜索和推荐系统方面。

Conclusion: 本论文着眼于提高ML系统效率，通过跨栈方法，提出了涵盖算法、系统和硬件的解决方案。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU加速的图索引库Tagore，用于解决高维向量空间中近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的索引由于其高精度和高效率而备受关注。然而，基于图的索引的索引开销仍然很大。随着数据量的指数增长以及对动态索引调整的需求不断增长，这种开销持续增加，构成了严峻的挑战。

Method: 本文介绍了一种名为GNN-Descent的GPU特定算法，用于高效的k-最近邻（k-NN）图初始化。此外，还提出了一个通用计算程序CFS，并设计了两个广义GPU内核，用于并行处理邻居关系中的复杂依赖关系。对于超过GPU内存容量的大规模数据集，本文还提出了一种异步GPU-CPU-disk索引框架，该框架具有集群感知缓存机制，可最大程度地减少磁盘上的I/O压力。

Result: Tagore在7个真实世界的数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明Tagore在保持索引质量的同时，实现了1.32x-112.79x的加速。

Conclusion: Tagore在保持索引质量的同时，实现了1.32x-112.79x的加速。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The Semantic Units Framework is introduced to improve ecological data integration, causal reasoning, and knowledge synthesis by modeling data and knowledge as modular, logic-aware semantic units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena, but differences in data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability, reuse, and causal understanding.

Method: a novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR and CLEAR Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular, logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent groups of propositions (compound units).

Result: Universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These support causal reasoning, confounder detection, effect identification with unobserved confounders, application of do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models, and structural causal models.

Conclusion: The Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research by linking fine-grained empirical data to high-level causal reasoning.

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite是一个基于LLM的SQL重写框架，通过结合上下文构建和强化学习，生成可执行、等效和高效的查询，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SQL查询重写方法依赖于预定义的重写规则，泛化能力差，难以处理复杂的查询，并且许多有效的重写策略无法通过声明性规则完全捕获。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）生成重写。它集成了两个核心组件：上下文构建模块和强化学习框架。

Result: E3-Rewrite实现了可执行、等效和高效的查询重写，与现有技术相比，查询执行时间减少了25.6%，成功重写次数增加了24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，与最先进的方法相比，查询执行时间减少了25.6%。此外，它还提供了高达24.4%的更成功的重写，将覆盖范围扩大到以前系统无法处理的复杂查询。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

TL;DR: ReLSum利用强化学习生成简洁的、与查询相关的产品描述摘要，优化搜索相关性，并在离线和在线指标上均取得了显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务搜索引擎通常仅依赖产品标题作为排名模型的输入，但产品标题通常缺乏足够的细节来捕捉查询意图，导致相关性预测不佳。虽然产品描述提供了更丰富的信息，但其冗长性和篇幅使其不适合实时排名，特别是对于像交叉编码器排名模型这样计算成本高的架构。

Method: 一种新颖的强化学习框架ReLSum，旨在生成简洁的、与查询相关的产品描述摘要，并针对搜索相关性进行优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，离线指标（包括召回率和NDCG）以及在线用户参与度指标均得到显著改善。

Conclusion: ReLSum显著提高了离线指标（包括召回率和NDCG）以及在线用户参与度指标，为增强大规模电子商务系统中的搜索相关性提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常依赖于简单的用户画像方法，例如平均或连接项目嵌入，这些方法无法捕捉用户偏好动态的细微性质，特别是长期和短期偏好之间的相互作用。

Method: LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling (LLM-TUP)

Result: LLM-TUP在多个基线上实现了显著的改进。

Conclusion: LLM-TUP在真实数据集上取得了显著改进，证明了时间感知用户画像方法和使用LLM生成的语义丰富的用户画像的有效性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

<details>

Motivation: 有效的推荐系统需要动态的用户理解，尤其是在复杂、不断发展的环境中。传统的用户画像通常无法捕捉到用户偏好的细微、时间上下文因素，例如短暂的短期兴趣和持久的长期品味。

Method: 评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 以生成语义丰富、具有时间意识的用户配置文件。通过分离短期和长期偏好来研究 LLM 在捕获用户上下文动态方面的有效性程度。将时间偏好定义为推荐的动态用户上下文，自适应地将这些不同的上下文组件融合到全面的用户嵌入中。

Result: 虽然 LLM 生成的配置文件提供了语义深度和时间结构，但它们对于上下文感知推荐的有效性在很大程度上取决于用户交互历史的丰富性。在密集域（例如，电影和电视）中观察到显着收益，而在稀疏环境（例如，视频游戏）中，改进不太明显。

Conclusion: LLM 生成的配置文件提供了语义深度和时间结构，但其用于上下文感知推荐的有效性在很大程度上取决于用户交互历史的丰富性。在密集域（例如，电影和电视）中观察到显着收益，而在稀疏环境（例如，视频游戏）中，改进不太明显。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应个性化对话信息检索框架APCIR，该框架根据查询的个性化需求级别，动态地调整个性化程度，并在TREC iKAT数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并非所有搜索查询都需要个性化。挑战在于在需要时适当地将个性化元素整合到搜索中。大多数现有研究使用大型语言模型隐式地整合用户的个人信息和对话上下文，而不区分每个查询轮次的特定需求。这种“一刀切”的个性化策略可能会导致次优的结果。

Method: 提出了一种自适应个性化方法，首先识别查询所需的个性化级别，并将个性化查询与其他查询重构相结合，以产生各种增强的查询。然后，设计了一种个性化感知排序融合方法，根据所需的个性化级别动态地为不同的重构查询分配融合权重。

Result: 在两个TREC iKAT数据集上评估了所提出的自适应个性化对话信息检索框架APCIR。结果证实了APCIR的自适应个性化的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化方法APCIR通过优于现有方法，证实了其有效性。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Method: The IndeGx framework was extended with a fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach using SPARQL rules and an OWL RL ontology.

Result: IndeGx can now build and reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection of public knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Over the last decade, knowledge graphs have multiplied, grown, and evolved on
the World Wide Web, and the advent of new standards, vocabularies, and
application domains has accelerated this trend. IndeGx is a framework
leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the
capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge
representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a
reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with
respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a
fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL
rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and
reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection
of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a
declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative
environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive
KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in
the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is
out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our
community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In
particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web
regarding supported standard languages, ontology usage, and diverse quality
evaluations by applying this method to a collection of over 300 open knowledge

Motivation: 传统的推荐方法通常忽略了对路线局部质量的洞察以及候选路线之间的比较，而这些对于提高推荐性能至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个名为综合比较网络(CCN)的新模型。CCN利用查询级别特征、项目级别特征，并引入了比较级别特征来描述不同路线之间的非重叠路段，以捕捉路线的局部质量。CCN中的关键组件综合比较块(CCB)旨在实现路线之间的比较。CCB包括一个综合比较算子(CCO)和一个多场景MLP，可以根据综合比较更新候选路线的表示。

Conclusion: CCN显著提高了路线推荐的性能，并表现出很强的可解释性。该模型已在Amap App中全面部署一年多，为路线推荐提供了稳定和最佳的效益。

Abstract: Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,
with the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to
users. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local
quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for
enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.
To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison
Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and
item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in
traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features
which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture
the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block
(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a
Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can
update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive
comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of
candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since
routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model
must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an
interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline
and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR
performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed
in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for
route recommendations.

TL;DR: Utilizes LLMs as offline judges to assess podcast recommendation quality in a scalable and interpretable manner by constructing natural-language user profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating personalized recommendations is challenging, especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods are costly.

Method: A two-stage profile-aware approach using LLMs to judge the quality of podcast recommendations.

Result: The profile-aware judge matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a variant using raw listening histories.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a LLM-based framework for evaluating podcast recommendations.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实解释方法容易产生偏差，生成的解释可能与用户的实际偏好不符。

Method: 该论文提出了一种预处理步骤，利用大型语言模型来过滤掉不符合用户偏好的历史项目。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法生成的反事实结果比单独使用 ACCENT 更符合用户的偏好。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种预处理步骤，利用大型语言模型来过滤掉不符合用户偏好的历史项目，然后再生成解释。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) offer a tangible and actionable way to
explain recommendations by showing users a "what-if" scenario that demonstrates
how small changes in their history would alter the system's output. However,
existing CFE methods are susceptible to bias, generating explanations that
might misalign with the user's actual preferences. In this paper, we propose a
pre-processing step that leverages large language models to filter
out-of-character history items before generating an explanation. In experiments
on two public datasets, we focus on popularity bias and apply our approach to
ACCENT, a neural CFE framework. We find that it creates counterfactuals that
are more closely aligned with each user's popularity preferences than ACCENT
alone.

### [150] [SPARC: Soft Probabilistic Adaptive multi-interest Retrieval Model via Codebooks for recommender system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09090)
*Jialiang Shi,Yaguang Dou,Tian Qi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes SPARC, a retrieval framework with RQ-VAE and a probabilistic interest module, to address the challenges of invariant interests and lack of exploration in multi-interest retrieval. Achieves significant gains in online A/B tests and offline evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1) Interests are invariant and fail to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy, mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and discovery of novel and long-tail interests.

Method: a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive Retrieval Model via Codebooks) utilizing Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to construct a discretized interest space and a probabilistic interest module that predicts the probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space

Result: Online A/B tests achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in PV500. Offline evaluations also showed consistent improvement in Recall@K and NDCG@K.

Conclusion: Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and practical value of the proposed method.

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can convert historical land patent descriptions into accurate geographic coordinates, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis.

Method: Systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates. Six OpenAI models were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.

Result: The top single-call model achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming other models and baselines. A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km).

Conclusion: LLMs are promising for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with

TL;DR: 提出了一种异构感知和成本有效的去中心化联邦学习 (DFL) 框架 Hat-DFed，旨在最大化模型性能，同时最小化累积能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习 (FL) 已成为边缘计算 (EC) 系统中一种有前途的范例，使众多边缘设备能够协同训练人工智能 (AI) 模型，同时保持数据隐私。为了克服与集中式参数服务器相关的通信瓶颈，去中心化联邦学习 (DFL) 利用对等 (P2P) 通信，已在研究界得到广泛探索。尽管研究人员设计了各种 DFL 方法来确保模型收敛，但其迭代学习过程不可避免地会随着模型复杂性和参与者数量的增长而产生相当大的成本。这些成本在很大程度上受到每个训练轮次中拓扑的动态变化的影响，特别是其稀疏性和连通性条件。此外，边缘环境中固有的资源异构性会影响学习过程的能源效率，而数据异构性会降低模型性能。这些因素对 EC 系统的有效 DFL 框架的设计提出了重大挑战。

Method: 我们设计了一种两阶段算法，该算法动态构建最佳通信拓扑，同时无偏估计它们对模型性能和能源成本的影响。此外，该算法还包含一种重要性感知模型聚合机制，以减轻数据异构性造成的性能下降。

Result: 最大化模型性能，同时最小化累积能耗

Conclusion: 我们提出了 Hat-DFed，一个异构感知和成本有效的去中心化联邦学习 (DFL) 框架。在 Hat-DFed 中，拓扑构建被 формулирован 作为双重优化问题，然后被证明是 NP-hard，目标是在复杂的边缘环境中最大化模型性能，同时最小化累积能耗。为了解决这个问题，我们设计了一种两阶段算法，该算法动态构建最佳通信拓扑，同时无偏估计它们对模型性能和能源成本的影响。此外，该算法还包含一种重要性感知模型聚合机制，以减轻数据异构性造成的性能下降。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

Motivation: 长期时间序列预测对于环境监测至关重要，但由于复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突发波动，水质预测仍然具有挑战性。在需要同时建模时间和空间动态的多站点场景中，这些挑战进一步加剧。

Method:  stepwise multimodal fusion network，集成了遥感降水图像以提供河流网络中的空间和环境背景信息。该网络通过自适应下采样对齐时间分辨率，并通过局部自适应分解来分解趋势和周期分量。利用交叉注意力门控融合模块动态地将时间模式与空间和生态线索相结合

Result: 通过在真实数据集上进行的大量实验，证明了相对于现有技术的显著改进

Conclusion: XFMNet在真实世界数据集上表现出显著优于现有最佳模型的性能，证明了其在空间分布式时间序列预测中的有效性。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当训练和测试数据的分布不同（域转移）时，深度学习模型的性能会下降。半监督域适应（SSDA）是解决这个问题的主要方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的利用两步动量编码器的SSDA框架MoSSDA，用于多元时间序列分类。MoSSDA采用域不变编码器来学习来自源域和目标域的特征。随后，学习到的特征被馈送到由在线动量编码器组成的混合增强正对比模块。

Result: MoSSDA在三个不同的骨干网络和目标域数据中各种未标记的比率下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MoSSDA在六个不同的数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融研究证实每个模块（包括两阶段学习）在提高性能方面都是有效的。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的在线蜂窝流量预测方法MGSTC，该方法利用多粒度时空特征互补性，并在实际数据集中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信行业仍然严重依赖人工专家干预。现有研究主要集中于详尽地探索时空相关性，但它们经常忽略蜂窝流量的潜在特征，这些特征是由电信服务的零星和突发性质决定的。此外，概念漂移为在连续蜂窝预测任务中保持令人满意的准确性造成了巨大的障碍。

Method: 一种基于多粒度时空特征互补(MGSTC)的在线蜂窝流量预测方法。

Result: 所提出的方法旨在在实际的连续预测场景中实现高精度的预测。MGSTC将历史数据分割成块，并采用粗粒度的时间注意力来为预测范围提供趋势参考。随后，利用细粒度的空间注意力来捕获网络元素之间的详细相关性，从而能够对已建立的趋势进行局部细化。这些多粒度时空特征的互补性有助于高效传输有价值的信息。为了适应连续预测的需求，我们实施了一种在线学习策略，可以实时检测概念漂移并及时切换到适当的参数更新阶段。

Conclusion: MGSTC在四个真实世界的数据集上优于11个最先进的基线。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Result: attention heads can store O($

Conclusion: the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone, but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over millions of years of evolution.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Moreover, a distribution-based material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material matches for an inferred emissivity distribution.

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for

augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material

DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Motivation: 在过去的十年中，已经提出了大量不同的数值方法来解决 {"-射线光谱学中的自动识别和量化问题。然而，缺乏包括数据集、代码和比较指标在内的通用基准，使得它们的评估和比较变得困难。

Method: 提出了一个开源基准，包括各种 {"-spectrometry 设置的模拟数据集、不同分析方法的代码和评估指标。这允许我们将最先进的端到端机器学习与使用全频谱的统计解混方法进行比较。

Result: 关于识别性能，对于所有比较指标，统计方法在所有三种情景中始终优于机器学习方法。但是，当谱特征未正确建模时，统计方法的性能会受到显着影响。\

Conclusion: 全频谱统计方法在已知或良好建模的谱特征下最有效，而当放射性核素识别的测量条件不确定时，端到端机器学习是一个不错的选择。在量化任务方面，统计方法提供了放射性核素计数的准确估计，而机器学习方法提供的结果不太令人满意。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Motivation: Relying solely on return as the optimality condition is weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences, lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks.

Method: A novel conditional diffusion modeling method based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy.

Result: Achieved a 11.29% increase in conversion and a 12.35% increase in revenue compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed conditional diffusion modeling method, enhanced with expert trajectory guidance and a skip-step sampling strategy, demonstrates effectiveness through offline experiments and online A/B testing, achieving a 11.29% increase in conversion and a 12.35% increase in revenue compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的使用交叉注意力的特征投影方法在深层特征中表现不佳。Mamba虽然擅长保持来自深层的全局拓扑信息，但忽略了浅层的细粒度细节。Mamba和交叉注意力之间存在全局-局部权衡。

Method: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net)

Result: HSA-Net在定量和定性上都优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net在定量和定性上都优于当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL减少了超过90%的数据传输，与集中式FL和HierFL相比，与SplitFed相比减少了50%，并且进一步改进了分层分割学习方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [165] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTM uses fuzzy logic for clause evaluation in Tsetlin Machines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer resources and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard TMs require thousands of clauses for competitive accuracy due to the strict 'all-or-nothing' clause evaluation strategy.

Method: The paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a variant of TMs with fuzzy clause evaluation.

Result: FPTM achieves significantly better accuracy with fewer clauses, reduced memory footprint, and faster training times compared to existing TM methods and neural networks on datasets like IMDb, Fashion-MNIST, and Amazon Sales.

Conclusion: FPTM significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, memory footprint, and training time across various datasets.

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

Result: 注意力前向传递是熵最优传输（EOT）问题的精确解，通过反向传播计算的标准梯度在数学上与基于优势的策略梯度相同，前向传递的EOT公式在注意力分布空间上诱导了一种特定的信息几何。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种基于原则的机制，其前向传递执行最佳推理，而后向传递实现合理的、流形感知的学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

*Sushant Vijayan,Arun Suggala,Karthikeyan VS,Soumyabrata Pal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm, Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), for online regret minimization in linear bandits using offline data. The algorithm's regret bound depends on the quality of the offline data, and the algorithm is shown to be optimal in certain regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently, this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature.

Method: Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE) uses an extended D-optimal design within each exploration phase.

Result: OOPE achieves an online regret is  ̃O(√deff T log (|mathcal{A}|T)+d^2). deff ≤ d) is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum (λk)k ∈ [d] of the Gram matrix of the offline data.

Conclusion: The algorithm is optimal in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or poorly explored. By using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended optimal design, the O(d^{2}) term is further improved to O(d^{2}/deff min { deff,1} ), which can be substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data deff = Ω(1).

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解变量之间的因果关系是各个科学学科的基础。大多数因果发现算法依赖于两个关键假设：(i) 观察到所有变量，以及 (ii) 潜在的因果图是非循环的。虽然这些假设简化了理论分析，但它们经常在现实世界的系统中被违反，例如生物网络。 现有的解释混杂因素的方法要么假设线性，要么难以扩展。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因素识别方面优于现有方法，并为该框架提供了一致性保证，增强了其理论可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer生成逼真且忠实于模型决策的解释，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a quadratically regularized POT (QPOT) formulation that induces sparsity in the transport plan, unlike existing methods. QPOT shows improved sparsity and performance in various experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POT solvers rely on entropic regularization, returning dense transport plans, which hinders adoption in applications favoring sparsity. POT lifts the stringent assumption of equal masses in conventional OT, offering greater flexibility.

Method: A novel formulation of POT with quadratic regularization (QPOT).

Result: Improved sparsity and favorable performance of QPOT formulation on synthetic, CIFAR-10 datasets, and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed QPOT formulation demonstrates improved sparsity and favorable performance in experiments.

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Motivation: 大多数大规模神经网络训练方法都假设同构并行计算资源。例如，同步 SGD 与数据并行是使用最广泛的并行训练策略，当 worker 以不同的速度处理其分配的数据时，会产生显著的同步开销。因此，在具有异构计算资源的系统中，用户通常仅依赖最快的组件（如 GPU）进行训练。在这项工作中，我们探讨了如何有效地利用异构资源进行神经网络训练。

Method: 提出了一种系统感知的本地随机梯度下降（local SGD）方法，该方法根据每个计算资源的计算能力按比例分配工作负载。为了更好地利用较慢的资源（如 CPU），我们有意将偏差引入到数据抽样和模型聚合中。

Result: 研究表明，在异构环境中，精心控制的偏差可以显著加速本地 SGD，在相同的时间预算内实现与数据并行同步 SGD 相当甚至更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 在异构环境中，精心控制的偏差可以显著加速本地 SGD，在相同的时间预算内实现与数据并行同步 SGD 相当甚至更高的准确率。这种基本的并行化策略可以很容易地扩展到不同的异构环境，包括云平台和多节点高性能计算集群。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for traffic prediction depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, posing challenges for efficient deployment and operation on large-scale datasets.

Method: A cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net with time series and spatio-temporal embeddings and a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism is introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed M3-Net model demonstrates superior prediction performance and lightweight deployment on real datasets.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 UQGNN 的新模型，用于多元时空预测，该模型优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型是确定性的，即仅预测预期平均值而不量化不确定性，从而导致潜在的不可靠和不准确的结果。虽然最近的研究引入了概率模型来量化不确定性，但它们通常侧重于单一现象，从而忽略了异构城市现象之间固有的相关性。

Method: 图神经网络与不确定性量化 (UQGNN)

Result: 在来自深圳、纽约市和芝加哥的四个真实世界多元时空数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明，UQGNN 在预测精度和不确定性量化方面始终优于最先进的基线。例如，在深圳数据集上，UQGNN 在预测精度和不确定性量化方面均提高了 5%。

Conclusion: UQGNN在预测精度和不确定性量化方面始终优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

*Keumseo Ryum,Jinu Gong,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHEFL，一种基于全局集成的联邦学习框架，用于解决联邦学习中客户端计算能力异构性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习支持使用客户端的私有数据进行分布式训练，但其收敛受到实际通信场景中的数据和系统异构性的阻碍。大多数现有的系统异构联邦学习方案利用全局修剪或集成蒸馏，但它们通常忽略了通信效率所需的典型约束。同时，深度集成可以聚合来自单独训练的模型的预测以提高性能，但当前基于集成的联邦学习方法未能完全捕获模型预测的多样性。

Method: 提出了一种基于全局集成的联邦学习框架SHEFL，该框架适用于具有不同计算能力的客户端。我们根据客户端可用的资源为客户端分配不同数量的全局模型。我们进一步引入了一种新的聚合方案，该方案考虑了具有不同计算能力的客户端之间的偏差。为了减少训练深度集成的计算负担并减轻数据偏差，我们动态调整了客户端之间的资源比率——在受限场景中积极降低弱势客户端的影响，而在相反的情况下增加它们的权重。

Result: 大量实验表明，

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了计算异构性问题，与现有方法相比，显著提高了公平性和整体性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Motivation: 强制固定低秩结构会限制权重矩阵的秩，并可能阻碍模型学习复杂模式的能力。此外，模型权重的有效秩在训练期间趋于下降，并且当模型被重新参数化为低秩结构时，这种下降会加速。

Conclusion: 提出了一种动态秩训练框架，该框架可以在各种基准测试中实现与基于 SVD 的低秩训练几乎相同的计算成本，同时实现与全秩训练相当的准确率。

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper presents a token-driven sparse finetuning method for small language models that improves performance and reduces training costs on specialized semantic classification tasks compared to other finetuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic text classification in industry requires understanding contextual significance and is often highly specialized, needing domain expert annotation. High inference throughput requirements limit model size, making customized classifiers based on finetuning smaller language models the preferred solution.

Method: The paper introduces a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt small language models to specialized classification tasks. It identifies and finetunes a small, sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while keeping most pretrained weights unchanged.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. It also achieves greater stability and half the training costs compared to end-to-end finetuning.

Conclusion: This paper develops a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy that outperforms existing methods like end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. It also achieves greater stability and reduces training costs compared to end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Motivation: 先前的工作通常利用上下文学习来迭代地引导模型找到更好的解决方案。然而，这些方法通常难以平衡新解决方案空间的探索与高回报解决方案空间的利用。最近，使用合成数据的测试时训练 (TTT) 已显示出提高解决方案质量的希望。然而，需要为每个任务量身定制的手工训练数据限制了跨领域的可行性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Result: achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks

Conclusion: The representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM) and introduces a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism to address the challenges of maintaining model stability and ensuring adaptability to new tasks in Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability.

Method: A novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. A multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism is introduced to enforce peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM.

Result: Student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity.

Conclusion: The proposed method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets on three standard OCIL benchmarks.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Motivation: Classic heuristic solvers become computationally intractable for larger problems. Neural networks struggle to generalize beyond the synthetic data they were trained on, especially in realistic TSP distributions.

Method: Combinatorial Optimization with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a generative TSP model

Result: COGS provides better data coverage and interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. COGS improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from worst-case scenarios.Introduced TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples.

Conclusion: COGS improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Motivation: Existing theoretical works on RF models have limitations, either focusing on stochastic samplers or exhibiting exponential dependence on problem parameters.

Method: Introduces a Langevin process as a corrector for multi-step RF models and conducts a detailed analysis of RF-based models.

Result: Achieves better polynomial discretization complexity than diffusion models in the multi-step setting and improves upon prior results for one-step diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: This work provides the first polynomial discretization complexity for both multi-step and one-step RF-based models, offering theoretical insights into their strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Conclusion: SARM通过将预训练的稀疏自编码器集成到奖励模型中，实现了奖励分配的特征级直接归因，允许动态调整偏好变化，并实现了优于传统奖励模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

*Long Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DiFac, a differentiated factor consistency semi-supervised framework, to improve GNN performance by deriving differentiated factors from a single source and enforcing consistency. It outperforms baselines in low-label regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However, obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed.

Method: propose a Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by these auxiliary factors.

Conclusion: DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

### [187] [TechOps: Technical Documentation Templates for the AI Act](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08804)
*Laura Lucaj,Alex Loosley,Hakan Jonsson,Urs Gasser,Patrick van der Smagt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces open-source templates for documenting data, models, and applications to provide sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.

Method: introducing open-source templates and examples for documenting data, models, and applications

Result: These templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act.

Conclusion: TechOps can serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and responsible AI development.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的无监督告警关系学习技术 Temporal Optimization (TempOpt)，用于更有效地识别根本告警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电信网络中，网络节点产生的故障告警在网络运营中心 (NOC) 中进行监控，以确保网络可用性和持续的网络运营。由于网络节点是互连的，因此网络中的单个故障会触发多个节点上的多个告警序列。从监控的角度来看，NOC 工程师要了解各种告警之间的关系，例如，当试图识别需要采取措施的根本告警时，这是一项具有挑战性的任务。为了有效识别根本告警，必须学习告警之间的关系，以便准确、快速地解决问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的无监督告警关系学习技术 Temporal Optimization (TempOpt)。

Result: 在真实世界网络数据集上进行的实验表明，与时间依赖方法相比，TempOpt 学习到的告警关系质量更高。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的无监督告警关系学习技术，Temporal Optimization (TempOpt)，该技术实用且克服了现有告警关系学习方法（时间依赖方法）的局限性。实验结果表明，与时间依赖方法相比，TempOpt 学习到的告警关系质量更高。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 Transformer 模型通常受到大量参数的限制，并且通过平滑处理捕获数据中的非平稳特征的能力有限。同样，MLP 模型难以有效管理多通道依赖关系。

Method: 结合小波变换与 MLP，在小波域中捕获数据的周期性和非平稳特征。提出了一种通道聚类策略，该策略结合了混合专家 (MoE) 框架，利用门控机制和专家网络来有效处理多通道依赖关系。

Result: WaveTS 系列模型实现了最先进的性能，且参数明显更少。WaveTS-M 在多通道数据集上表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型在多个真实世界时间序列数据集上实现了最先进的 (SOTA) 性能，且参数明显更少。WaveTS-M 在多通道数据集上表现出显著改进，突显了其有效性。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Introduces a systematic framework for constructing training datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be leveraged for interpretable design, validated by designing a flow battery manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of interpretability about what features drive optimality.

Method: we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of admissible designs.

Result: These findings are validated by using the framework to design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling efficient exploration.

Conclusion: This work broadens the applicability of generative machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

TL;DR: Oblivionis是一个用于联邦LLM训练的轻量级学习和取消学习框架，它使客户端能够选择性地删除特定的私有数据，从而增强了可信赖性和法规遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦LLM框架有效地实现了协作训练，而无需原始数据共享，但它们严重缺乏内置的法规遵从机制，例如GDPR的被遗忘权。集成私有数据加剧了对数据质量和长期治理的担忧，但现有的分布式训练框架没有提供有原则的方法来选择性地删除训练后的特定客户端贡献。

Method: 引入Oblivionis，一个轻量级的学习和取消学习框架，使客户端能够在联邦LLM训练期间选择性地删除特定的私有数据。

Result: Oblivionis在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了稳健的平衡，跨算法比较为未来的LLM开发提供了明确的方向。

Conclusion: Oblivionis优于本地训练，在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了稳健的平衡，跨算法比较为未来的LLM开发提供了明确的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Motivation: 构建现代深度学习系统，不仅有效，而且高效，需要重新思考模型训练和神经架构设计的既定范式。与其调整高度过度参数化的网络，然后应用模型压缩技术来减少资源消耗，不如采用一种新的高性能网络，跳过昂贵的参数更新的需求，同时只需要一小部分参数，使其具有高度的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 在二元和多类分类任务中，该方法比当前最优方法实现了更好的准确率和稀疏性水平，而不需要任何梯度信息。此外，当扩展到更复杂的网络架构和学习任务时，需要适当的评估指标。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores optimization techniques to impose function-space priors on BNNs by using trainable activations. The empirical results indicate that BNNs with flexible trainable activation can effectively achieve desired function-space priors, even with a single wide hidden layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output, thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is challenging.

Method: optimization techniques that explore how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and symmetries.

Result: BNNs with flexible trainable activation can effectively achieve desired function-space priors.

Conclusion: BNNs with a single wide hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively achieve desired function-space priors.

TL;DR: Current evaluations of causal machine learning methods are flawed. This paper proposes principles for rigorous synthetic data analysis to build trust and promote adoption.


<details>

Motivation: Causal machine learning is underutilized due to a lack of trust caused by inadequate empirical evaluations, especially the use of synthetic experiments.

Result: A set of principles for conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic experiments are essential for assessing causal machine learning methods.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Conclusion: APRNet优于现有技术。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Motivation: The vulnerability of continual learning models against adversarial attacks during the class-incremental continual learning process has not been investigated sufficiently.

Method: Exploration of vulnerability to stage-transferred attacks.

Result: Continual learning methods are highly susceptible to stage-transferred attacks. Model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation explain this phenomenon. Existing adversarial training-based defense methods are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks.

Conclusion: Continual learning methods are highly susceptible to stage-transferred adversarial attacks, and existing adversarial training-based defense methods are not sufficiently effective against these attacks.

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
