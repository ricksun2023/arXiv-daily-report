### [1] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究综述了多语言模型中社会偏见的评估与缓解方法，揭示了该领域在语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术选择上的差距，并为未来的研究提出了方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明，预训练的多语言模型与处理英语文本的模型一样，存在社会偏见。因此，有必要将偏见评估和缓解方法扩展到多语言和非英语环境中。

Method: 通过系统性回顾新兴研究，考察了它们在语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术上的选择。

Result: 揭示了该领域主流方法设计选择上的差距，例如偏爱某些语言、多语言缓解实验的稀缺性，同时记录了在跨语言和文化调整偏见基准时遇到的常见问题和已实施的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来的研究指明了方向，这些研究可以加强多语言偏见文献的包容性、跨文化适应性以及与最先进的自然语言处理进展的结合。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [2] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用语言模型自动生成多项选择题（MCQ），以降低手动测试开发的成本和不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在降低手动测试开发的成本和不一致性。

Method: 比较微调的中型模型 (Gemma, 2B) 与未调优的较大型模型 (GPT-3.5, 175B)，并评估七种结构化提示策略。

Result: 结构化提示，特别是结合思维链和顺序设计的策略，显著提高了 Gemma 的输出。Gemma 通常比 GPT-3.5 的零样本响应产生更多符合结构和教学上适当的项目。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效的微调可以增强中型模型在有限数据条件下的 AIG 性能。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO使小型语言模型能够在资源受限的环境中实现类人RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型由于推理能力差，难以进行强化学习，导致奖励稀疏和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出了一种蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），该方法通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和策略优化期间的持续教师指导来解决这些挑战。

Result: DGPO使小型模型能够实现复杂的类人搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至优于大型教师模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现类人RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GUARD, a testing method that translates government-issued AI ethics guidelines into actionable testing questions to assess LLM compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that current government ethics guidelines for LLMs are too high-level, making it difficult to verify LLM compliance.

Method: GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions and jailbreak diagnostics to test LLM adherence to government-issued guidelines.

Result: The effectiveness of GUARD was validated on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7. GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models.

Conclusion: GUARD effectively assesses LLM compliance with government-issued guidelines and can be used to promote reliable LLM-based applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR: A novel framework designed to enhance long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long contexts due to memory limitations, inability to tackle complex tasks, lack of transparency and hallucinations.

Method: Synopsis extraction by chunking text strategically, building a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, incorporating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to navigate complex reasoning paths.

Result: JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Conclusion: JERR enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出使用 NP-hard 图问题作为新的合成训练语料库，以提升大型语言模型 (LLM) 的长链思考 (Long CoT) 推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Long CoT 行为依赖于高质量的、人工构建的后训练数据集，成本高昂，缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 论文开发了一个两阶段的后训练框架：(1) 在拒绝采样的 NPH 图实例上进行 Long CoT 监督微调 (SFT)，以增强推理深度；(2) 使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习 (RL)，以提高推理效率。

Result: 提出的 Graph-R1-7B 模型在数学、编程、STEM 和逻辑等领域表现出强大的泛化能力，并在 NPH 图问题上的准确性和推理效率方面超过了 QwQ-32B。

Conclusion: NPH 图问题是推进 LLM 中 Long CoT 推理的一种有效且可扩展的资源，为 LLM 后训练开辟了新的领域。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) 的框架，用于评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 在考虑上下文的情况下的人格。研究发现，对话历史可以提高LLM响应的一致性，但也可能导致人格转变。不同的LLM对上下文的依赖程度不同，而将该框架应用于角色扮演代理 (RPA) 可以提高响应一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心理测试方法在评估LLM时忽略了对话历史的影响，这与LLM在现实世界中的应用不符，因为在现实世界中，对话历史会影响LLM的响应。

Method: 该论文提出了CAPE框架，该框架考虑了先前的对话交互。此外，论文还引入了新的指标来量化LLM响应的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，对话历史可以通过上下文学习提高LLM响应的一致性，但也可能导致人格转变。GPT模型对问题顺序具有鲁棒性，而Gemini-1.5-Flash和Llama-8B则表现出显著的敏感性。GPT模型的响应源于其内在人格特征以及先前的交互，而Gemini-1.5-Flash和Llama-8B则严重依赖于先前的交互。将该框架应用于RPA可以提高响应一致性，并更好地与人类判断保持一致。

Conclusion: 该论文表明，在评估LLM的人格时，考虑上下文是重要的。CAPE框架可以用于评估LLM在考虑上下文的情况下的人格，并可以用于提高RPA的响应一致性。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过研究中间推理步骤对最终答案正确性的贡献，发现条件熵降低与正确答案相关，而平坦或增加的熵通常导致错误答案。不正确的推理路径往往比正确的路径更长，这表明更长的推理并不一定产生更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的最新进展通常依赖于生成中间推理步骤来提高准确性。然而，很少有工作研究推理效用如何有助于最终答案的正确性。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文并不能保证增加对答案的信心。

Method: 使用 Qwen2.5-32B 和 GPT-4o 在 MATH 数据集上生成推理链，然后使用单独的模型 (Qwen3-8B) 量化这些链对最终准确性的效用。具体来说，使用条件熵（词汇表上的预期负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤中答案范围 Y 上的不确定性，其中上下文逐步扩展。

Result: 条件熵随步骤的减少与正确答案密切相关，而平坦或增加的熵通常会导致错误的答案。不正确的推理路径往往比正确的路径更长，这表明更长的推理并不一定产生更好的结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为未来的工作奠定了基础，以设计能够及早发现和避免无成效推理的有效推理管道。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs in the dental field, revealing performance gaps and the importance of domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of evaluation resources for LLMs in specialized medical fields like dentistry.

Method: Introduce DentalBench, a bilingual benchmark with QA and a large-scale corpus for domain adaptation.

Result: Significant performance gaps across task types and languages are revealed. Domain adaptation substantially improves model performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks are important for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR: 使用语料库中心的知识图谱增强复杂查询的上下文表示，提高RAG系统的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库层面的上下文丢失问题，而KG-CQR侧重于通过结构化的关系表示来丰富查询。

Method: KG-CQR包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成模块，作为一个模型无关的pipeline运行，确保在不同大小的LLM上的可扩展性，无需额外训练。

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上，KG-CQR的性能优于强大的基线模型，mAP提高了4-6%，Recall@25提高了2-3%。

Conclusion: 通过结合KG-CQR，在诸如多跳问答等具有挑战性的RAG任务中，检索效果始终优于现有基线。

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门针对民用航空维护领域的大型语言模型（LLM）评估工具，现有评估主要集中在数学和编码推理任务上。

Method: 开发了一个工业级基准，用于衡量LLM在民用航空维护中的能力。利用该基准评估现有的向量嵌入模型和LLM在民用航空维护场景中的性能。

Result: 通过实验探索和分析，证明了该基准在评估模型在该领域性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文开源了评估基准和代码，以促进进一步的研究和开发，为民用航空维护领域更智能的解决方案奠定基础。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效地搜索实践工作标题，并在随机标题测试中表现出一致的检索效果和较高的平均匹配度。

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

Motivation: 现有的基于API的基准不能充分评估llm的能力，因为它们依赖于显式的工具规范、浅层的几步工作流和孤立的域操作。

Method: MCP-Bench构建在模型上下文协议(MCP)之上，将llm连接到28个具有代表性的实时MCP服务器，这些服务器跨越金融、旅游、科学计算和学术搜索等领域，包含250个工具。每个MCP服务器提供一套协同工作的互补工具，从而可以构建具有丰富输入输出耦合的真实的多步骤任务。

Result: 在20个先进的llm上进行的实验表明，在MCP-Bench中仍然存在挑战。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench测试agents从模糊指令中检索相关工具的能力，为复杂目标规划多跳执行轨迹，在中间工具输出中获得响应，并协调跨域工作流。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于预测ICU患者死亡率和资源利用率的深度学习框架，该框架集成了多模态EHR数据，并在真实数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化EHR数据，忽略了自由文本中的临床见解，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息。

Method: 利用两个真实世界的EHR数据集，开发并评估了一个深度学习模型，该模型使用自然语言处理技术整合多模态EHR数据。进行了消融研究，评估了医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件。

Result: 在三个临床任务的实验中，该模型在死亡率预测、LOS预测和手术时长估计方面均优于现有方法，且对结构化EHR中的数据损坏具有较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种有效且准确的深度学习方法，可用于预测危重护理中的死亡率和资源利用率。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 阴谋论会削弱公众对科学和机构的信任，并且会不断发展和吸收反面证据，从而抵制揭穿。本研究介绍了一个阴谋论数据集ConspirED，该数据集使用CONSPIR认知框架对来自在线阴谋文章的多句摘录（80-120 个单词）中的阴谋思想的认知特征进行注释。使用 ConspirED，我们 (i) 开发计算模型来识别阴谋论特征并确定文本摘录中的主要特征，以及 (ii) 评估大型语言/推理模型 (LLM/LRM) 对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。我们发现两者都与阴谋论内容不一致，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使在成功转移可比较的事实验证的错误信息时也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能生成的虚假信息变得越来越复杂，理解阴谋内容的修辞模式对于开发有针对性的预先揭穿和评估人工智能漏洞等干预措施非常重要。

Method: 我们介绍了ConspirED（CONSPIR 评估数据集），它捕获了在线阴谋文章的多句摘录（80-120 个单词）中的阴谋思想的认知特征，并使用 CONSPIR 认知框架（Lewandowsky 和 Cook，2020）进行注释。

Result: 我们发现，阴谋论内容与大型语言/推理模型 (LLM/LRM) 不一致，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使在成功转移可比较的事实验证的错误信息时也是如此。

Conclusion: ConspirED 是第一个针对一般认知特征注释的阴谋内容数据集。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+ benchmark存在问题，不适合真正的多语言评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现FLORES+基准测试在多语言评估方面存在严重缺陷，尤其是在质量控制和文化偏差方面。

Method: 人工评估翻译质量，并测试简单的命名实体复制启发式方法。

Result: 许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源句在领域上过于具体，并且在文化上偏向英语世界。简单的命名实体复制可以产生显著的BLEU分数。在高质量、自然数据上训练的MT模型在FLORES+上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 多语言MT基准测试应使用领域通用和文化中立的源文本，减少对命名实体的依赖，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Motivation: 现有主题发现方法依赖词嵌入，缺乏对科学出版物的全面理解，难以处理复杂文本关系。

Method: 1. 构建文本编码器，捕捉元数据、标题和摘要等内容。
2. 构建空间优化模块，整合基于熵的采样和LLM引导的三元组任务，关注主题相关性和上下文。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，SciTopic优于现有最佳科学主题发现方法。

Conclusion: SciTopic能够帮助研究人员更深入、更快速地获得洞察力，实现更容易的科学信息检索。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Motivation: 以往的联邦学习研究主要关注标签多样性，忽略了语言领域的差异性，这在自然语言处理中至关重要。为了解决真实环境中非独立同分布数据带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了一个统一的基准框架，包含多样化的数据，并设计了自适应联邦蒸馏（AdaFD）框架，以应对同构和异构环境下的多域非独立同分布挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的模型能够捕捉到本地客户端的多样性，并取得比现有方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了AdaFD框架，可以有效应对多域非独立同分布的挑战，并在实验中取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抽取式摘要模型存在多阶段信息损失和语义理解不足的问题，尤其是在处理复杂搜索意图时。

Method: 该方法集成了大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码等技术，将一个轻量级模型转化为领域专业的QDTS专家。

Result: 该模型在多个工业界相关指标上优于生产基线，并达到了新的state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: 该模型具有出色的部署效率，只需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可处理大约50,000个queries per second，平均延迟为55ms。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Motivation: 先前研究侧重于通过内容规划和不同的表达来使问题生成多样化，但是这些方法通常强调生成简单的问题，而忽略了整合重要的知识，例如文档中的相关句子。为了解决数据稀疏性问题，提高语言模型学习的质量。

Method: KCS 将知识组合选择建模为句子级别的条件预测任务，并利用概率对比损失来预测下一个最相关的知识。

Result: KCS 改进了知识组合选择的总体准确性 3.9%，并且其在数据增强方面的应用在 HotpotQA 和 2WikiMultihopQA 数据集上产生了改进。

Conclusion: KCS 是一种有效的方法，可以通过抽样不同的知识组合来扩展生成的多跳问题的多样性，从而提高知识组合选择的准确性，并在 HotpotQA 和 2WikiMultihopQA 数据集上实现了改进。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: 现有的图语言模型 (GLM) 评估基准不足以评估多模态推理，因为它们可以使用单模态信息来实现强大的性能。为了解决这个评估差距，我们引入了 CLEGR 基准，旨在评估各种复杂程度的多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 GLM 评估基准主要用于节点级分类数据集，不足以评估多模态推理。分析表明，仅使用单模态信息即可在这些基准上实现强大的性能，这意味着它们不需要图语言集成。

Method: 我们引入了 CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) 基准，该基准旨在评估各种复杂程度的多模态推理。我们的基准采用合成图生成管道，并结合需要对结构和文本语义进行联合推理的问题。

Result: 软提示的 LLM 基线与包含完整 GNN 主干的 GLM 的性能相当。GLM 在需要结构推理的任务中表现出显着的性能下降。

Conclusion: 目前 GLM 的图推理能力存在局限性，并为推动社区朝着涉及图结构和语言的显式多模态推理发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的全局距离感知建模方法（GDLLM），用于事件时间关系抽取（ETRE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLM）的预训练知识有限，难以处理不平衡分类数据集中的少数类关系。大型语言模型（LLM）的人工设计的提示或指令可能会引入额外的噪声，干扰模型对事件之间长距离依赖关系的判断。

Method: 该方法利用图注意力网络（GAT）构建距离感知图结构，以帮助LLM捕获长距离依赖特征。此外，设计了一种基于软推理的时间特征学习范式，以增强对短距离邻近带关系识别，将LLM生成的概率信息补充到多头注意力机制中。

Result: 在两个公开数据集TB-Dense和MATRES上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效地捕获了全局特征，从而显著提高了少数关系类的性能，并提高了整体学习能力。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivation: 现有的NEC模型主要依赖音素级别的编辑距离算法，但在错误转录的词与真实实体差异较大时效果不佳，限制了其应用。

Method: 利用语音特征检索候选实体，并设计了一种生成方法来注释ASR文本中的实体错误。

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上进行了测试，结果表明该NEC方法可以显著提高实体准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在词形差异较大的情况下有效，并且将开源自建的测试集和训练数据。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于隐式话语关系识别 (IDRR) 的多语言多标签分类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该模型利用话语意义之间的层级依赖关系，预测 PDTB 3.0 框架中所有三个意义层级的概率分布。

Method: 该模型名为 HArch，使用了 RoBERTa 和 XLM-RoBERTa 作为预训练编码器。

Result: RoBERTa-HArch 在英语中表现最佳，而 XLM-RoBERTa-HArch 在多语言环境中表现最佳。微调模型始终优于 GPT-4o 和 Llama-4-Maverick 等大型语言模型。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在 IDRR 中，特定任务的微调优于提示，并在 DiscoGeM 1.0 语料库上报告了 SOTA 结果，进一步验证了分层方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重点关注隐写术和水印中由于分词不一致(TI)导致的鲁棒性问题，提出了针对TI的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提高了文本生成的能力和效率，但也带来了恶意滥用的风险，本文旨在解决隐写术和水印中分词不一致(TI)的问题，因为TI会降低鲁棒性。

Method: 针对TI的两个关键特征：低频性和临时性，提出了两种定制的解决方案：隐写术的逐步验证方法和水印的事后回滚方法。

Result: 实验表明，对于隐写术，直接解决TI可以提高流畅性、不可感知性和反隐写分析能力；对于水印，解决TI可以提高可检测性和抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效地解决了隐写术和水印中分词不一致的问题，提高了系统的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent is a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The model aims to improve complex problem-solving by using advanced cognitive behaviors like careful tool use and reflection on feedback.

Method: The model uses an efficient RL infrastructure, GRPO-RoC algorithm, and a multi-RL stage training recipe.

Result: rStar2-Agent achieves pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B).

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent demonstrates strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use tasks.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [32] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的方法DP-ST，它利用语义三元组在本地DP保证下进行邻域感知私有文档生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自然语言处理中的差分隐私（DP）方法通常通过在DP保证下转换文本来保护隐私，但这种方法需要在非常高的ε值下才能合理地实现私有化。

Method: DP-ST方法利用语义三元组，采用分而治之的策略，将DP限制在私有化邻域内，并结合LLM后处理以生成连贯的文本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在较低的ε值下也能生成连贯的文本，同时平衡了隐私和效用。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了连贯性在以合理的ε水平实现平衡的私有化输出方面的重要性。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

TL;DR: 本研究专注于隐性仇恨言论的检测，通过微调基于大型语言模型的通用嵌入模型，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐性仇恨言论难以检测，因为它不包含明确的贬义或煽动性词语。为了解决这个问题，可以使用外部知识或附加信息来补充特定任务的流程。

Method: 通过微调基于大型语言模型的通用嵌入模型，例如 Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed 和 E5。

Result: 在多个 IHS 数据集上的实验表明，在数据集内评估中，F1-macro 得分提高了 1.10 个百分点，在跨数据集评估中，F1-macro 得分提高了 20.35 个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过微调通用嵌入模型，可以在隐性仇恨言论检测方面实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自适应解码方法 GUARD，通过结合全局和局部不确定性信号，有效地平衡了文本生成的多样性和连贯性，并提高了生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比搜索解码策略在开放式文本生成中难以平衡连贯性和多样性，且存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于“Glocal”不确定性驱动框架的自适应解码方法 GUARD，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差，并引入基于 token 计数的惩罚来降低计算开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，GUARD 在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得了良好的平衡，并显著提高了生成速度。在不同文本质量维度上的比较研究中，人类和 LLM 评估器都验证了其卓越的性能。

Conclusion: GUARD 是一种有效的解码方法，可以在保证文本质量的同时，提高生成速度。

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 评估由大型语言模型(LLM)生成的合成治疗对话是否能够捕捉到真实治疗中细微的情感动态，因为这些合成对话越来越多地用于心理健康自然语言处理，以模拟咨询场景、训练模型和补充有限的真实世界数据。

Method: 采用了Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架来分析效价、唤醒和优势维度上的细粒度情感轨迹。分析跨越完整对话和个人说话者角色（咨询师和客户），使用了从公共视频转录的真实会话和来自CACTUS数据集的合成对话。

Result: 发现合成对话虽然流畅且结构连贯，但在关键的情感属性上与真实对话不同：真实会话表现出更大的情感变异性、更富情感色彩的语言以及更真实的反应和调节模式。此外，真实和合成说话者之间的情感弧相似性较低，尤其是对于客户。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在局限性，情感保真度在心理健康应用中非常重要。为了支持未来在该领域的研究，引入了一个精选的真实CBT会话数据集RealCBT。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) 的白盒方法，通过增强模型拒绝有害请求的能力来提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 的安全性对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的安全机制可以通过消融或移除模型内的特定表征方向来绕过。本文提出相反的方法来增强安全对齐。

Method: ROSI 是一种简单的、免微调的秩一权重修改方法，应用于所有残差流写入矩阵。所需的安全性方向可以从一小部分有害和无害的指令对中计算出来。

Result: ROSI 能够持续提高安全拒绝率，并在 MMLU、HellaSwag 和 Arc 等标准基准测试中保持模型的效用。ROSI 还可以通过增强其自身的潜在安全方向来重新对齐“未审查”模型。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重调整是一种低成本且有效的机制，可以提高 LLM 的安全性，是对资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Motivation: 青少年心理健康问题日益严重，因此人们越来越关注使用自动化方法检测数字文本中心理困扰的早期迹象。尽早发现这些扭曲可能有助于及时进行低成本的干预。

Method: 分析荷兰青少年撰写的论坛帖子，研究认知扭曲检测的跨语言和跨语域泛化能力。

Result: 语言和写作风格的变化会显著影响模型性能，但领域自适应方法最有希望。

Conclusion: 领域自适应方法在跨语言和跨语域认知扭曲检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Motivation: 现有的RAG系统评估通常集中在单源信息或简短的事实性问题上，无法满足需要整合多源信息的实际应用需求。

Method: 提出了一个可扩展的框架，用于构建评估基准，以挑战RAG系统整合不同来源的信息并生成长篇回复的能力。构建了两个新的基准数据集MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet，分别代表叙事综合和摘要任务，需要从大型集合中检索信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，生成质量高度依赖于检索效果，并且因任务而异。即使在oracle检索设置中，多源合成仍然具有挑战性，但推理模型明显优于标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息整合和长文本生成对RAG系统提出了挑战，检索效果对生成质量至关重要，推理模型在多源合成方面表现更优。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

Motivation: 探索量化对多语言任务的影响，特别是在资源受限的硬件上部署大型语言模型时。

Method: 使用五种大型语言模型（1.7B到70B参数），在55种语言上进行大规模的训练后量化（PTQ）评估。

Result: 4-bit量化通常能保持高资源语言和大型模型的翻译质量，但在低资源和类型多样的语言中，特别是在2-bit设置下，性能显著下降。GGUF变体即使在2-bit精度下也能提供最稳定的性能。语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景中提供益处。

Conclusion: 为在量化约束下部署用于机器翻译的多语言LLM提供了可操作的见解，尤其是在低资源环境中。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 评估语音到语音（S2S）大型语言模型（LLM）仍然是一个根本性的挑战。

Method: 提出SageLM，它联合评估语义和声学维度，并利用基于理由的监督来增强可解释性并指导模型学习。引入了SpeechFeedback数据集，并采用两阶段训练范例。

Result: SageLM与人类评估者的协议率为82.79％，优于级联和基于SLM的基线。

Conclusion: SageLM在S2S LLM评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在动态环境中作为自主代理，尤其是在多轮对话环境中，常常面临推理不一致、不遵守领域特定策略以及提取信息不准确等问题。

Method: 该研究首先手动分析了对话轨迹中常见的错误，然后尝试重新构建工具调用代理的输入以改进代理的决策。最后，提出了IRMA框架，该框架自动重构用户查询，并结合相关的领域规则和工具建议。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRMA在整体pass@5得分上显著优于ReAct、Function Calling和Self-Reflection，分别提高了16.1%、12.7%和19.1%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在动态环境中，IRMA相比其他方法具有更高的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有的ICL选择策略在结构化预测任务中忽略了结构对齐，导致性能欠佳和泛化能力差。

Method: 首先，使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，使其能够选择语义相关且结构对齐的示例。然后，使用一个插件模块增强检索器，该模块可以放大隐藏表示中的句法信息。

Result: 在跨越三个语义解析任务的四个基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能够提高ICL在结构化预测任务中的性能，并在效率、泛化性和性能之间取得平衡。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

TL;DR: ProactiveEval: A unified framework for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs, covering target planning, dialogue guidance, and diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs' proactive dialogue abilities are fragmented and domain-specific.

Method: A unified framework (ProactiveEval) is proposed, decomposing proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, with evaluation metrics across various domains and automatic data generation.

Result: Experiments with 22 LLMs show DeepSeek-R1 excels in target planning, while Claude-3.7-Sonnet leads in dialogue guidance.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities influence proactive behaviors, with implications for future model development.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除大型语言模型(LLM)中后门行为的新方法，它利用内部和外部机制来减少攻击成功率，同时保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门防御缺乏全面性，无法承受基于模型编辑、多触发和无触发攻击等高级场景。

Method: LETHE利用轻量级数据集训练一个干净的模型，然后将其与后门模型合并，通过稀释模型参数记忆中的后门影响来中和恶意行为。此外，LETHE将良性和语义相关的证据纳入提示中，以分散LLM对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个广泛使用的LLM上的分类和生成领域的实验结果表明，LETHE优于8个最先进的防御基线，对抗8个后门攻击。LETHE将高级后门攻击的攻击成功率降低了高达98%，同时保持了模型效用。

Conclusion: LETHE已被证明具有成本效益，并且对自适应后门攻击具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是自然语言处理中的一项重要任务。目前的方法在Wikidata数据集上的表现不佳。

Method: 使用capsules中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取。

Result: 在Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, 和 Conll04等数据集上，该方法优于当前最佳方法。该模型可以更好地进行重表示。

Conclusion: Wikidata标签中的噪声和重表示是句子关系抽取中的挑战。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国国税局指出，美国人平均花费270美元和13个小时来报税，且报税需要复杂的推理。误差会导致高昂的罚款，因此自动化系统必须提供高准确性和可审计性，而大型语言模型（LLM）不太适合这项任务。

Method: 该方法集成了LLM与符号求解器来计算税务义务。同时，将纯文本规则预先翻译成形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的案例表示。

Result: 在StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA)数据集上的评估表明，该系统具有希望，并具有经济可行性。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有希望提高获得可靠税务帮助的公平性，并具有经济可行性。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为CHAIR-DPO的方法，用于减少多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM容易产生幻觉，即生成与视觉输入不符的答案。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标区分生成答案的优劣(即无幻觉和有幻觉样本)，并通过直接偏好优化(DPO)微调现成的MLLM。

Result: CHAIR-DPO有效减少了多个幻觉基准测试中的幻觉答案数量。

Conclusion: 基于CHAIR的奖励微调MLLM是有效的。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像伪造定位框架，该框架集成了图像生成和稳定扩散（SD）的强大感知能力，以实现更高效和准确的伪造定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像伪造定位方法严重依赖于劳动密集且成本高昂的标注数据，难以跟上新兴图像处理技术的步伐。

Method: 将SD的多模态架构与伪造相关信息相结合，使模型能够固有地输出伪造定位结果。利用Stable DiffusionV3 (SD3)的多模态框架，通过将图像伪造残差（使用特定的高通滤波器提取的高频信号）视为一种显式模态，在训练期间将其融合到潜在空间中，从而增强伪造定位性能。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上，该框架的性能比当前最先进的图像伪造定位模型提高了12%。

Conclusion: 该模型在涉及真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像的取证任务中表现出强大的性能，即使在训练期间完全没有见过这些数据。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Motivation: 目前人工智能模型在诊断皮肤病方面取得了显著成功，但其预测的可解释性有待提高。MLLM和定量属性是两种有前景的方法。

Method: 该研究探索了MLLM嵌入空间如何基于定量属性，通过微调来预测图像中的属性值，并使用SLICE-3D数据集进行了基于属性特定内容的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究表明，MLLM嵌入空间可以基于定量属性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提高皮肤病诊断模型的可解释性提供了一种潜在的途径，将MLLM与定量属性相结合。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自动调制识别（AMR）的统一 Vision Transformer (ViT) 框架，该框架集成了监督、自监督和重建目标，以解决现有解决方案依赖大量标记数据或多阶段训练管道的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动调制识别解决方案通常依赖于大型标记数据集或多阶段训练管道，这限制了实践中的可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 该模型结合了 ViT 编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器；重建分支将增强信号映射回其原始信号，将编码器锚定到细粒度的 I/Q 结构。

Result: 在 RML2018.01A 数据集上，该方法在低标签情况下优于监督 CNN 和 ViT 基线，仅使用 15-20% 的标记数据即可达到 ResNet 级别的准确率，并在不同的 SNR 水平上保持强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为 AMR 提供了一种简单、通用且标签高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Method: 提出一个由粗到精的框架，首先生成音频同步的表示，然后使用姿势引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率、长时程的视频。利用解耦的姿势序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点来减少漂移，并引入手部特定奖励机制来增强语义准确性和手势真实感。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman框架能够有效提升音频驱动人体动画的视频生成质量，并在身份保持、手部准确性和唇同步方面表现出色。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Conclusion: 在模型架构中集成空间音频提示对于全向视频中的准确显着性预测至关重要

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 当前视觉模型的发展主要关注性能提升，而忽略了解释性。理解视觉模型在一般图像上的行为对于防止偏差判断和识别模型趋势非常重要。

Result: 该流程可以用于发现失败案例，并深入了解视觉模型。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，以推进图像分析。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa

southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact

while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective

Motivation: 在工业制造中，快速可靠地鉴定先进材料仍然是一个瓶颈，特别是对于通过非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 本研究使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型自动分割脑部血管周围间隙(PVS)，该模型在同质数据集上表现良好，但在异质数据集上的泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割PVS耗时且可靠性低，现有深度学习模型泛化能力不足。

Method: 使用Transformer结构的3D卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，分别在同质T2w和异质T1w MRI数据集上训练模型。

Result: 在同质数据集上Dice系数达到0.88，在异质数据集上Dice系数较低，LOSOCV下Dice系数更低。MedNeXt-L-k5未超过nnU-Net。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5为自动PVS分割提供了一种有效方案，但Transformer中的注意力机制并非PVS高精度分割的必要条件。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework to improve CLIP's open-vocabulary segmentation by propagating output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization and inconsistent propagation of spatial coherence to the final output. Intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, limiting CLIP's potential.

Method: The proposed framework adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. It includes attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble.

Result: The method consistently improves performance across eight benchmarks and integrates seamlessly into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed feedback-driven framework enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions, leading to improved open-vocabulary segmentation performance.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个探究多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)内部处理动态的框架，通过在不同层提取token embeddings并训练线性分类器来预测细粒度的视觉类别，从而系统地分析MLLM如何处理视觉和文本输入。该框架应用于LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, 和 Qwen2-VL，结果表明MLLM具有一致的阶段性结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)的内部处理动态研究不足。

Method: 通过训练线性分类器来预测细粒度的视觉类别，从token embeddings中提取在每一层，使用标准化的anchor question。通过三种类型的受控prompt变体评估这些探测器：(1)测试对表面水平变化的敏感性的词汇变体，(2)通过修改prompt中的视觉概念来翻转预期答案的语义否定变体，(3)保留推理但改变答案格式的输出格式变体。

Result: 早期层执行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇集成和语义推理，最后一层准备特定于任务的输出。虽然整体阶段性结构在视觉tokenization、指令调整数据和预训练语料库的变化中保持稳定，但每个阶段的特定层分配随着基本LLM架构的变化而显着变化。

Conclusion: 该研究结果为MLLM的层级组织提供了一个统一的视角，并提供了一种轻量级的、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于解开视觉语言共同嵌入空间的监督字典学习方法，将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的分量向量，以提高概念过滤图像检索的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言共同嵌入网络（如CLIP）提供了一个具有语义信息的潜在嵌入空间，可用于下游任务。我们假设嵌入空间可以被解开，通过将嵌入分解为位于不同子空间中的多个概念特定分量向量来分离复杂场景内容的信息。

Method: 提出了一种监督字典学习方法，以估计一个线性合成模型，该模型由字典（原子）中向量组的稀疏、非负组合组成，其组别活动与多标签信息相匹配。每个概念特定的分量都是与标签相关的原子的非负组合。通过一种新颖的交替优化方法优化组结构字典，并保证收敛性。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的稀疏线性概念子空间（SLiCS）提供的解开嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索（以及使用图像到提示的条件生成）。我们将SLiCS应用于来自TiTok的高度压缩的自编码器嵌入和来自自监督DINOv2的潜在嵌入。定量和定性结果突出了所有嵌入的概念过滤图像检索的改进精度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的监督字典学习方法，通过将视觉语言嵌入空间解耦为概念特定的分量，实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub is a GUI toolkit for deploying and evaluating medical VLMs securely within hospital environments, addressing concerns about PHI exposure and cyberthreats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs have great potential but pose security risks like PHI exposure, data leakage, and cyberthreats, especially in hospitals.

Method: Developed MedFoundationHub, a GUI toolkit for deploying and evaluating medical VLMs, ensuring privacy-preserving inference through Docker and supporting various open-source models.

Result: Pathologists evaluated five VLMs using MedFoundationHub, revealing limitations like off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent terminology.

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub enables secure and accessible deployment of medical VLMs, but expert evaluations revealed recurring limitations in current VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为双向交互 Mamba (BIM) 的新方法，用于多任务密集预测，该方法通过新颖的扫描机制改进了 Mamba 建模方法，在交互完整性和计算效率之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务密集预测方法需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间进行权衡，因为充分的交互通常导致高计算复杂度。

Method: 引入双向交互扫描 (BI-Scan) 机制，构建任务特定的双向序列表示，并采用多尺度扫描 (MS-Scan) 机制实现多粒度场景建模。

Result: 在 NYUD-V2 和 PASCAL-Context 两个基准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明 BIM 优于现有技术。

Conclusion: BIM 方法在多任务密集预测中表现出色，因为它能够有效地保持关键的跨任务信息，并满足不同任务的多样化粒度需求。

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的音频引导视觉编辑框架，可以通过多个文本和音频提示处理复杂的编辑任务，而无需额外的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频引导视觉编辑方法通常需要在特定数据集上进行训练，以使音频与文本对齐，从而限制了它们在现实世界中的推广。

Method: 利用具有强大zero-shot能力的预训练多模态编码器，并通过减轻音频编码器空间和扩散模型的提示编码器空间之间的差异，将不同的音频集成到视觉编辑任务中。此外，我们提出了一种新的方法，通过我们单独的噪声分支和自适应补丁选择来处理具有多个和多模态编辑提示的复杂场景。

Result: 在各种编辑任务上的综合实验表明，我们的框架通过结合来自音频的丰富信息，在处理复杂的编辑场景方面表现出色，而纯文本方法则失败了。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂编辑场景中优于纯文本方法

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，用于在只有部分标注数据的情况下进行多标签学习，该框架在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全标注大型数据集成本高昂，因此研究从部分标注数据中学习。传统方法容易产生不准确和假阴性，并且整合伪标签策略会引入额外的噪声。

Method: 该论文提出了广义伪标签鲁棒损失（GPR Loss）和动态增强多焦点伪标签（DAMP）技术，共同构成了自适应和高效的视觉-语言伪标签（AEVLP）框架。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架显著提升了多标签分类效果，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: 提出的AEVLP框架在多标签分类任务上取得了显著的进展。

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Result: 该方法在对象检测和车道线检测任务中取得了最先进的性能，延迟低于5个时间步长。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以更低的延迟实现更精确的特征表示，从而在视觉检测任务中实现高性能和超低延迟。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测 (SOD) 方法容易丢失细节，模糊边缘，以及在复杂场景中单模态信息融合不足。

Method: 1. 设计了动态不确定性图卷积模块 (DUGC)，通过基于空间语义距离构建的稀疏图来传播层之间的不确定性，并结合通道自适应交互，有效提高了小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。
2. 提出了多模态协同融合策略 (MCF)，该策略使用可学习的模态门控权重来对 RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图进行加权融合。它可以根据不同的场景动态调整每个模态的重要性，有效抑制冗余或干扰信息，并加强跨模态之间的语义互补性和一致性。
3. 通过多尺度 BCE 和 IoU 损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导的监督机制，优化像素级和区域级的检测性能。

Result: 在大多数常见基准数据集上，DUP-MCRNet 优于各种 SOD 方法，尤其是在边缘清晰度和对复杂背景的鲁棒性方面。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet有效地提升了显著目标检测的性能，尤其是在复杂场景下对细节和边缘的处理方面。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端可训练深度学习方法在检测视图中尺度始终过小或过大的行人，或视图之间尺度差异巨大的行人时，效果不佳。这是因为它们没有利用多尺度图像特征来生成BEV特征和检测行人。

Method: MSMVD通过将从各个视图提取的多尺度图像特征逐尺度地投影到BEV空间，生成多尺度BEV特征。然后，MSMVD通过使用特征金字塔网络处理多尺度BEV特征，结合多个视图的不同尺度信息。

Result: MSMVD在GMVD数据集上比之前的最高MODA高出4.5个点。

Conclusion: 利用多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征可以大大提高检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，SFMFNet在准确性和效率之间取得了良好的平衡，具有很强的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Conclusion: SFMFNet在实时deepfake检测中具有优势。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Motivation: 在实际医疗环境中，部署大型模型通常受到计算资源限制，这对其进行实际应用提出了重大挑战。因此，开发轻量级模型至关重要，这些模型在保持计算效率的同时，可以实现与大型模型相当的性能。

Method: 采用双模型权重选择策略，该策略使用从大型预训练模型得出的权重来初始化两个轻量级模型，从而实现有效的知识转移。接下来，将SKD应用于这些选定的模型，从而可以使用各种初始权重配置，而不会增加额外的计算成本，然后针对目标分类任务进行微调。

Result: 在公开可用的数据集（胸部X射线图像、肺部计算机断层扫描和脑部磁共振成像扫描）上进行的大量实验表明，与现有方法相比，该方法具有卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过将双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏相结合，该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，传统方法通常无法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息。

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于LiDAR点云压缩的新方法，该方法通过几何重密集化和跨尺度特征传播来提高压缩效率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理LiDAR点云时，由于几何细节的极端稀疏性，导致上下文建模效率低下，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 该方法包含两个模块：几何重密集化模块（Geometry Re-Densification Module）和跨尺度特征传播模块（Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module）。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的压缩率和实时性能，在12位量化下，编码和解码均达到26 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过集成这两个模块，该方法产生了一种紧凑的特征表示，能够提供高效的上下文建模并加速编码过程。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用视频数据进行3D资产生成的方法，以解决3D数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D数据量不足，限制了3D生成模型的效果。视频数据包含常识先验知识，可以弥补3D数据的不足。

Method: 本文构建了一个大规模视频数据集Droplet3D-4M，并提出了一个生成模型Droplet3D，该模型支持图像和文本输入。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够生成空间一致且语义合理的内容，并且可以扩展到场景级别的应用。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验知识能够显著促进3D内容的生成。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

TL;DR: G^2Editor: A framework for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Existing editing methods often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control.

Method: Leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Incorporates hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation to guide the appearance details of the edited object.

Result: G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality.

Conclusion: G^2Editor benefits downstream data-driven tasks.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during

effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability

TL;DR: 提出了一种病理信息驱动的领域随机化策略，通过模拟脑部改变来解决胎儿脑分割中CCD数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的胎儿脑分割对于提取生物标志物和评估神经发育至关重要，但CCD的稀有性限制了深度学习模型的泛化。

Method: 提出一种病理信息驱动的领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入到合成数据生成流程中，仅通过模拟健康数据来模拟各种脑部改变。

Result: 在包含健康胎儿、CCD和其他脑部病变的队列中验证了该方法，在CCD病例上取得了显著改进，同时保持了在健康胎儿和其他病变上的性能。病理信息驱动的增强将健康病例的LCC估计误差从1.89mm降低到0.80mm，将CCD病例的LCC估计误差从10.9mm降低到0.7mm。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识纳入合成数据流程可以有效缓解数据稀缺问题，并加强对罕见但具有临床意义的畸形分析。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音识别系统对于听力障碍人士存在固有的局限性。手语和唇语是有效的替代方案，但它们在很大程度上是孤立研究的，缺乏统一的框架。

Method: 设计了一个统一的、模态无关的架构，能够有效地处理异构输入；探索模态之间的协同作用，特别是唇动作为手语理解中的非手动线索的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR上实现了与特定任务的state-of-the-art模型相当或更好的性能。明确地将唇动建模为一个单独的模态显著提高了SLT性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地整合多种模态的信息，并在多个任务上取得了优异的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉-语言模型（VLM），存在复杂性和次优性能问题，缺乏端到端训练。

Method: 提出 Video-MTR，一种强化多轮推理框架，通过迭代选择视频片段，并引入门控双层奖励系统。

Result: 在 VideoMME、MLVU 和 EgoSchema 等基准测试中，Video-MTR 的准确性和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-MTR 推进了长视频理解的技术水平。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO) 的新测试时自适应 (TTA) 框架，旨在解决单目3D目标检测 (M3OD) 中的领域转移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTA方法无法解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性：语义不确定性和几何不确定性，这导致模型在实际环境中的可靠性下降。

Method: 该方法通过凸优化视角引入了focal loss的凸结构，并推导出一个新的无监督版本，实现了与标签无关的不确定性加权和高不确定性对象的平衡学习。同时，设计了一个语义感知的法向场约束，以保持具有清晰语义线索区域中的几何连贯性。

Result: 大量实验表明，DUO在各种数据集和领域转移类型上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过双分支机制形成互补循环：增强的空间感知提高了语义分类，而稳健的语义预测进一步完善了空间理解，从而实现了更鲁棒的M3OD。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在 MVTec 3D-AD 数据集上实现了新的最先进水平，并显着降低了误报率。

Conclusion: IAENet 在工业部署中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Result: 在Emu Edit基准测试中，DescriptiveEdit提高了编辑的准确性和一致性。

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit克服了指令数据集质量的限制，无缝集成了ControlNet、IP-Adapter和其他扩展，并且更具可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续测试时自适应中，模型仅依赖目标数据特征，这可能导致混淆和引入学习偏差。现有方法通过模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证，存在误差累积问题。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，并通过保持子特征和整体特征之间的一致性，从多个角度全面捕获数据特征。此外，设置自适应阈值并计算每个样本的置信度分数，以进行损失加权自监督学习，减少伪标签的噪声。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了其在持续测试时自适应场景中的一致性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的CTTA框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习，有效解决了伪标签质量不高和误差累积的问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定的质量对于评估新视角合成的进展至关重要，因为标定上的1像素误差对重建质量有显著影响。虽然真实场景没有ground truth，但标定的质量通过新视角合成的质量来评估。

Method: 使用3DGS模型通过反向传播新视角颜色损失相对于相机参数来微调相机标定。

Result: 新的标定仅在3DGS用作参考的数据集上带来了0.4 dB PSNR的平均改进。

Conclusion: 微调可能很长，其适用性取决于训练时间的严格性，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量的风险最为重要。

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

### [83] [Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530)
*Mingqian Ji,Jian Yang,Shanshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据级融合框架，用于无监督3D目标检测，该框架在早期阶段融合RGB图像和LiDAR数据，利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，并引入双向融合方法，同时提出了局部和全局滤波方法来减轻噪声，以及一种基于数据级融合的动态自进化策略，以迭代地改进伪盒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LiDAR的3D目标检测器通常依赖于手动标注的标签进行训练以获得良好的性能，然而，获得高质量的3D标签是耗时且费力的。为了解决这个问题，最近的工作探索了无监督的3D目标检测，通过引入RGB图像作为辅助模态来辅助伪盒的生成。然而，这些方法只是简单地整合由LiDAR点云和RGB图像生成的伪盒，这种标签级的融合策略对伪盒质量的提升有限，因为它忽略了LiDAR和RGB图像数据在互补性方面的性质。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型对图像进行实例分割和深度估计，并引入一种双向融合方法，其中真实点从2D空间获取类别标签，而2D像素被投影到3D以增强真实点密度。为了减轻深度和分割估计中的噪声，我们提出了一种局部和全局滤波方法，该方法应用局部半径滤波来抑制深度估计误差，并应用全局统计滤波来去除分割引起的异常值。此外，我们提出了一种基于数据级融合的动态自进化策略，该策略在密集表示下迭代地改进伪盒，从而显著提高定位精度。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，通过我们的方法训练的检测器明显优于之前最先进的方法训练的检测器，在nuScenes验证基准上实现了28.4$\%$的mAP。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的数据级融合框架，通过在早期阶段融合RGB图像和LiDAR数据，并结合双向融合、局部和全局滤波以及动态自进化策略，显著提高了无监督3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于深度学习的BMI估算方法，该方法使用一个大型的智能手机图像数据集WayBED进行训练，并在两个数据集上取得了当前最优的结果。此外，作者还发布了完整的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远程医疗或紧急情况下，传统的BMI测量方法不可用或不切实际，因此需要通过相机图像估算BMI。

Method: 该方法使用深度学习模型，并在WayBED数据集上进行训练。此外，还引入了一种自动过滤方法，通过姿势聚类和人体检测来筛选数据集，去除低质量的图像。

Result: 在WayBED数据集上，该方法实现了7.9%的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE），在VisualBodyToBMI数据集上实现了13%的MAPE。在VisualBodyToBMI数据集上进行微调后，实现了8.56%的MAPE，这些结果都是目前已知的最低值。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的BMI估算方法，并在移动设备上部署了完整的流程。作者还开源了模型训练、过滤和移动部署的代码。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了领域自适应（DA）技术在自然图像和医学图像分类中的应用，通过557个模拟实验，评估了七种常用DA技术在五个自然数据集和八个医学数据集上的表现，涵盖了各种场景，如分布外、动态数据流和有限的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 更好地理解领域自适应（DA）在自然图像和医学图像中的优势，现有研究更多集中于自然图像，而医学图像更难处理，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。

Method: 使用七种广泛使用的DA技术，在五个自然数据集和八个医学数据集上进行了557次模拟研究，涵盖各种场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，深度子域自适应网络（DSAN）算法表现出色，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50实现了可行的分类精度（91.2%），并且在动态数据流DA场景中，与基线相比，精度提高了+6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上表现出卓越的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解DA技术，并为模型有效适应医学数据提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为对比学习辅助分支（CLAB）的方法，用于提高视频对象检测在图像退化情况下的鲁棒性，且不会增加推理时的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的对象检测由于运动模糊、遮挡和形变等图像退化问题而具有挑战性，现有方法虽然通过特征聚合和复杂的后处理技术提高了性能，但也增加了计算负担。

Method: 该方法通过对比学习辅助分支和动态损失权重策略来增强特征表示能力，在训练初期强调辅助特征学习，随着训练收敛逐渐优先考虑检测任务。

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，使用ResNet-101和ResNeXt-101时，CLAB分别达到了84.0% mAP和85.2% mAP的性能。

Conclusion: CLAB在不增加额外后处理的情况下，实现了基于CNN的模型的state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了针对CLIP视觉编码器的排版攻击，并提出了一种选择性消融排版电路的防御方法，无需微调即可显著提高模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性，同时对标准ImageNet准确率的影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究排版攻击如何利用多模态系统，通过将文本注入图像来导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成，甚至导致视觉-语言模型越狱。分析CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为。

Method: 定位模型后半部分中专门的注意力头，这些注意力头有因果地提取并将排版信息传输到cls token。通过选择性地消融由注意力头组成的排版电路来防御CLIP模型，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上，性能提高了高达19.6%，而标准ImageNet-100准确率降低不到1%。该方法与依赖于微调的最先进的排版防御方法相比，仍具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列对排版攻击具有更强鲁棒性的阅读障碍CLIP模型，这些模型可以作为各种安全关键型应用的合适替代品，在这些应用中，基于文本的操纵风险超过了文本识别的效用。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that region-level embeddings from quotient graphs improve prediction performance in facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

TL;DR: FastFit: A fast multi-reference virtual try-on framework using a cacheable diffusion architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods lack support for multi-reference outfit compositions and are inefficient due to redundant feature re-computation.

Method: Proposes FastFit, a framework with Semi-Attention and class embeddings to decouple reference feature encoding from denoising, enabling feature caching.

Result: Achieves 3.5x speedup over comparable methods and surpasses state-of-the-art fidelity on VITON-HD, DressCode, and DressCode-MR datasets.

Conclusion: FastFit addresses key limitations in virtual try-on, offering improved speed and fidelity, and introduces a new large-scale dataset, DressCode-MR, for multi-reference virtual try-on research.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising

Motivation: 深度神经网络 (DNN) 的日益复杂导致采用拆分推理 (SI)，这是一种在边缘设备和云之间划分计算的协作范例，以减少延迟并保护用户隐私。然而，数据重建攻击 (DRA) 的最新进展表明，在 SI 中交换的中间特征可用于恢复敏感输入数据，从而构成严重的隐私风险。现有的 DRA 通常仅对浅层模型有效，并且无法充分利用语义先验，从而限制了它们的重建质量和跨数据集和模型架构的通用性。

Result: 大量实验表明，我们的方法大大优于之前的攻击，尤其是在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及针对更深层和更复杂的 DNN 时。

Conclusion: 我们的方法优于之前的攻击，尤其是在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及针对更深层和更复杂的 DNN 时，证明了该方法的有效性

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

*Yiguo Jiang,Xiaodong Cun,Yong Zhang,Yudian Zheng,Fan Tang,Chi-Man Pun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoCAST is a diffusion-based framework for text-driven emotional talking head synthesis that addresses limitations in control, naturalness, and quality of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotional talking head synthesis methods lack control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality, hindering real-world applications. Datasets are limited.

Method: EmoCAST uses a diffusion-based framework with a text-guided decoupled emotive module for appearance modeling and an emotive audio attention module to capture audio-emotion interplay. It also uses a new emotional talking head dataset and emotion-aware training strategies.

Result: EmoCAST achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos.

Conclusion: EmoCAST effectively generates realistic and expressive talking-head videos by addressing limitations in existing methods with its novel framework, modules, dataset, and training strategies.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于SwinUNETR的深度学习框架，用于乳腺癌诊断和分类，并在ODELIA挑战赛中获得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性癌症相关死亡的主要原因之一，早期检测至关重要。MRI是一种高灵敏度的乳腺癌检测工具，尤其适用于高风险或乳腺组织致密的女性。

Method: 该方法基于SwinUNETR，结合了乳腺区域掩模、广泛的数据增强和集成学习。

Result: 该方法在ODELIA挑战赛排行榜上获得第二名。

Conclusion: 该方法具有支持临床乳腺MRI判读的潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 AvatarBack，一个用于重建完整和一致的 3D Gaussian 头像的框架，通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域来解决现有方法对前视图图像的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖前视图图像，导致后脑重建质量差，几何不一致，结构模糊，降低了重建头像的真实感。

Method: AvatarBack 整合了两个核心技术创新：Subject-specific Generator (SSG) 和 Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA)。SSG 利用生成先验从稀疏的前端输入合成具有身份一致性的、合理的后视图伪图像，提供鲁棒的多视图监督。ASA 采用在训练期间优化的可学习变换矩阵，有效地解决固有的姿势和坐标差异，从而实现这些合成视图和 3D Gaussian 表示之间的精确几何对齐。

Result: 在 NeRSemble 和 K-hairstyle 数据集上的大量实验表明，AvatarBack 显著提高了后脑重建质量，同时保持了前端的保真度。

Conclusion: 重建的头像在不同的运动下保持一致的视觉真实感，并且保持完全可动画。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术史学家需要识别历史绘画中的人物，但传统方法主观且受数据和风格变化的限制。传统面部识别模型在绘画作品中表现不佳。

Method: 通过微调基础模型并将其嵌入与传统面部识别网络相结合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于当前最先进的方法，并且基础模型可以弥补传统方法的不足。

Conclusion: 基础模型可以有效提升艺术品中的面部识别效果。

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个文本引导的涂鸦生成框架，旨在极端风格转换下保持面部识别度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的媒介中，面部特征的细微扭曲会消除对象的辨识度，从而破坏个人和文化真实性。因此，论文旨在解决在涂鸦风格转换中保持面部身份的问题。

Method: CraftGraffiti首先通过LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer应用涂鸦风格转换，然后通过面部一致的自注意力机制（用显式身份嵌入增强注意力层）来保证身份保真度。姿势定制无需关键点，使用CLIP引导的提示扩展来实现动态重新姿势，同时保持面部连贯性。

Result: 定量结果表明，CraftGraffiti具有竞争性的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学和人类偏好分数。在Cruilla音乐节的实际部署突出了系统的实际创意影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了尊重身份的AI辅助艺术的目标，为在创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了一个原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）通过整合外部知识来增强大型语言模型，但在高风险领域存在严重的局限性，即对噪声或矛盾证据的敏感性以及不透明的随机决策。

Method: 用使用定量双极论证框架（QBAF）的结构化推理代替黑盒推理。ArgRAG从检索到的文档构建QBAF，并在逐步语义下执行确定性推理。

Result: 在PubHealth和RAGuard两个事实验证基准上进行了评估，ArgRAG在显着提高透明度的同时，实现了强大的准确性。

Conclusion: ArgRAG是一种可解释且可争议的RAG替代方案，它使用定量双极论证框架进行结构化推理，从而允许忠实地解释和质疑决策。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

TL;DR: QAgent是一个LLM驱动的多代理系统，可以完全自动化OpenQASM编程，并通过集成任务规划、上下文学习、RAG、预定义生成工具和CoT推理来提高编译和功能正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在经典计算机上难以解决的问题上，NISQ设备已经开始展现出早期的量子优势。然而，由于OpenQASM编程的复杂性，非专业人士很难实现这些优势。虽然基于LLM的代理在自动化经典编程工作流程方面显示出希望，但它们的量子对应物主要局限于量子化学或纠错等专门任务。

Method: QAgent集成了任务规划、上下文小样本学习、检索增强生成（RAG）以实现长期上下文、预定义的生成工具和思维链（CoT）推理。

Result: QAgent将QASM代码生成的准确率提高了71.6%。

Conclusion: 该多代理系统是实现量子编程普及、弥合专业知识差距并加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动因素。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

They then evaluated each sub-agent and the multi-agent system using automated and human evaluations.

Result: The paper presents the Personal Health Agent (PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions to address individual health needs. The evaluation involved more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of effort from health experts and end-users.

Conclusion: The work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong foundation towards the vision of a personal health agent accessible to everyone.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成有害内容的能力带来了安全挑战，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间取得平衡。

Method: 该方法利用一个专门的守卫模型进行意图推理、多层次安全分类和查询重写，以消除边缘案例查询中潜在的有害意图。构建了一个包含约163,000个查询的综合数据集，并进行了监督微调和多奖励优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，IntentionReasoner在多个安全基准、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现出色，显著提高了安全性，同时有效降低了过度拒绝率并提高了响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner 是一种有效的安全机制，可以在提高LLM安全性的同时，减少过度拒绝并提升回复质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

Result: 研究结果表明，推理工作量可以预测人类决策时间。当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都投入了更大的精力，表明两者对任务难度具有相似的敏感性，并且模式与认知双过程理论一致。

Conclusion: 研究表明，人工智能的推理工作量反映了人类在主观判断中的处理时间，并强调了推理轨迹在可解释性和决策中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为P2C的新框架，用于生成从不利结果到有利结果的行动计划，同时考虑了特征之间的因果关系和行动的顺序性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、法律和招聘等高风险领域，机器学习模型越来越多地被用于决策，因此需要提高透明度。现有的反事实方法忽略了特征之间的因果依赖关系，并且假设所有干预都可以同时发生，这在实际场景中是不现实的。

Method: P2C 显式地模拟特征之间的因果关系，并确保计划中的每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的。P2C 使用目标导向的 Answer Set Programming 系统 s(CASP) 来生成计划，同时考虑了由于因果依赖关系而自动发生的特征变化。

Result: P2C 优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，后者可能生成非法操作。

Conclusion: P2C 能够生成在现实世界中可实现的反事实解释。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为任务中心指令增强（TCIA）的框架，用于系统地扩展指令，同时保持多样性和任务对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略实际应用中的一个重要因素：任务相关性。大多数应用受益于针对其特定用例定制的任务特定知识。因此，开发不仅保持多样性，而且针对特定实际场景进行优化的指令增强方法至关重要。

Method: 通过在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，TCIA创建了一组丰富的任务相关指令，并使模型能够推广到这些任务特定指令，而不会牺牲整体性能。

Result: TCIA在四个实际的、特定于任务的应用中，将开源LLM的性能平均提高了8.7%，在某些情况下，超过了领先的闭源模型。

Conclusion: TCIA是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，用于将LLM适应于实际的、以任务为中心的应用程序。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EAS旨在量化大型语言模型在答案生成过程中的不确定性。

Method: EAS集成了模型自身的token级别预测熵，以捕捉生成过程中不确定性的演变，无需外部模型或重复采样。

Result: EAS与跨模型和数据集的答案熵密切相关。在训练数据选择中，EAS能够识别高潜力样本，并在相同的样本预算下持续优于Pass Rate过滤，从而提高学生模型在数学基准测试中的准确性。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的工具，可为LLM训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估提供实用的工具。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Motivation: Inefficient experience generation hampers Agentic AI development, especially in complex benchmarks like GAIA.

Method: AWorld, an open-source system for large-scale, distributed agent-environment interaction.

Result: AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x and improves GAIA accuracy of a Qwen3-32B-based agent from 21.59% to 32.23%.

Conclusion: AWorld and the trained agent provide a blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Governable AI (GAI) framework to address the security risks of advanced AI by using external, cryptographically enforced structural compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety approaches have limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, potentially leading to systemic disasters.

Method: The GAI framework uses a rule enforcement module (REM), governance rules, and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) to ensure AI compliance.

Result: The paper provides a formal security proof and a prototype implementation demonstrating the effectiveness of the GAI framework in high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: The GAI framework offers a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI by decoupling governance rules and the technical platform and ensuring non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型生成合成数据，以增强健康相关事实核查的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查具有挑战性，因为带注释的训练数据有限。

Method: 提出一个合成数据生成管道，该管道利用大型语言模型（LLM）来扩充健康相关事实核查的训练数据。该管道总结源文档，将摘要分解为原子事实，并使用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表。从表中的蕴含关系，进一步生成具有二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了LLM驱动的合成数据增强在提高健康相关事实核查器性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Motivation: 自动练级机器人在大型多人在线角色扮演游戏(MMORPG)中利用自动化程序大规模升级角色，破坏游戏平衡和公平性。检测这些机器人具有挑战性，不仅因为它们模仿人类行为，而且因为惩罚性行动需要可解释的理由，以避免法律和用户体验问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的框架，该框架利用对比表示学习和聚类技术，以完全无监督的方式识别具有相似升级模式的角色群体。为了确保可靠的决策，我们引入了一个大型语言模型(LLM)作为辅助审查员来验证集群组，有效地模仿了二次人工判断。我们还引入了一种基于增长曲线的可视化，以帮助LLM和人工版主评估升级行为。

Conclusion: 本文研究结果表明，该框架能够有效地检测MMORPG中的自动练级机器人，并为游戏平衡和公平性提供支持。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Conclusion: AI 的未来不仅在于提高性能，还在于构建能够加深我们对人脑理解的系统。

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial

contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive

that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和科学推理等领域展示了执行复杂任务的能力。本文旨在构建一个agent框架，以解决科学计算中的问题。

Method: 该agent框架包含Consultant、Reviewer和Programmer三个模块，分别负责问题重写、代码生成和代码审查修订，通过协作和交互的方式工作。

Result: 该框架在解决偏微分方程、病态线性系统和数据驱动的物理分析问题上表现出色，显著提高了无bug代码生成率，并减少了非物理解决方案的出现。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了自动代码生成和审查作为一个有前景的科学计算范例。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 医疗保健领域的人员调度是一个重要的运营挑战，需要平衡控制劳动力成本、满足患者需求和考虑员工偏好等多个目标。

Method: 提出了一种多目标遗传算法 (MOO-GA)，将医院部门的人员调度问题建模为多目标优化任务。该模型考虑了实际的复杂性，包括每小时的预约驱动需求和使用模块化轮班进行多技能劳动力。

Result: 在代表典型医院部门的数据集上进行演示，结果表明 MOO-GA 生成了稳健且平衡的计划表。与模拟传统手动调度过程的基线相比，该算法生成的计划表平均提高了 66%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地管理了关键运营目标和以员工为中心的目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理人员提供了一个实用的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Method: 新的概率损失允许学习约束和目标，从而提供一个完整的模型，该模型可以被审查并补充侧约束。通过将组合求解器推出训练循环，该架构还提供可扩展的训练，而精确推理可以实现最大精度。

Result: 在 Sudoku 基准的三个变体上，该方法所需的训练时间仅为其他混合方法的一小部分。在视觉 Min-Cut/Max-cut 任务中，它优化遗憾值优于 Decision-Focused-Learning 遗憾专用损失。最后，它有效地学习了设计蛋白质的大型现实问题的能量优化公式。

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效地学习如何从自然输入中解决 NP 难题。

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

*Junda Wang,Zonghai Yao,Zhichao Yang,Lingxi Li,Junhui Qian,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一种名为ChatThero的多智能体对话框架，旨在通过结合CBT和MI的个性化治疗对话来改善药物滥用障碍(SUDs)的治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物滥用障碍治疗因社会耻辱、动机障碍和个性化支持不足而效果不佳。大型语言模型(LLMs)在心理健康方面有潜力，但缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密结合。

Method: 构建了一个包含简单、中等和困难阻力水平的高保真合成基准，并采用包括监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)的两阶段训练流程来训练ChatThero。

Result: ChatThero在患者动机方面平均提高了41.5%，治疗信心提高了0.49%，解决困难案例所需的轮数比GPT-4o减少了26%。自动化和人工临床评估均表明，ChatThero在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该框架为治疗性对话的严格、保护隐私的研究提供了支持，并为研究和临床转化提供了强大、可复制的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管区块链技术最近取得了进展，但在 L1 区块链中运营节点仍然成本高昂。节点中资源最密集的组件之一是区块链数据库，也称为 StateDB，它管理余额、随机数、代码以及帐户/智能合约的持久存储。虽然由于改进的共识协议，区块链行业已经从分叉链过渡到无分叉链，但无分叉区块链仍然依赖于对其目的而言并非最佳的遗留分叉数据库。

Method: 提出了一个无分叉区块链数据库

Result: 与基于 geth 的 Fantom Blockchain 客户端相比，存储提高了 100 倍

Conclusion: 提出了一个无分叉区块链数据库，与基于 geth 的 Fantom Blockchain 客户端相比，存储提高了 100 倍，吞吐量提高了 10 倍。

Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in
blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node
is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances,
nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although
the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 分析了SQL中LLM集成的功能、性能和可扩展性限制，并提出了改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）已成为文本总结、情感分析和自动问答等应用的关键。最近，LLM也被集成到关系数据库管理系统中，以增强查询和支持高级数据处理。为了提升数据洞察力，像Amazon、Databricks、Google和Snowflake这样的公司直接在SQL中提供LLM调用（表示为LLM查询）。

Method: 使用五个代表性查询，对两个开源系统和一个企业平台进行了早期探索，以揭示当前SQL调用LLM集成中的功能、性能和可扩展性限制。

Result: 确定了三个主要问题：强制结构化输出、优化资源利用和改进查询计划。实施了初步解决方案，并观察到在适应LLM驱动的SQL查询方面的改进。

Conclusion: 这些早期成果表明，更紧密的LLM+DBMS集成是可扩展和高效处理LLM查询的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的自动特征增强框架ReCoGNN，通过利用来自多个关系表中的特征来增强初始数据集，以支持预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、医疗保健和电子商务等领域，数据已成为驱动创新的基础资产。在这些领域中，通常采用基于关系表的预测建模，并且越来越强调通过自动化机器学习 (AutoML) 技术来减少人工工作量。这提出了一个有趣的问题：特征增强本身可以自动化，并且可以识别和利用与任务相关的关系信号吗？

Method: ReCoGNN 首先通过对表内属性关系进行建模来捕获每个表中的语义依赖关系，从而能够将表划分为结构化的、语义上连贯的段。然后，它构建一个异构加权图，该图表示所有段之间的行间关系。最后，ReCoGNN 利用消息传递图神经网络来通过图传播信息，指导特征选择和增强原始数据集。

Result: 在十个真实和合成数据集上进行的大量实验表明，ReCoGNN 在分类和回归任务上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReCoGNN 是一种有效的自动特征增强框架，可以在各种预测任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感推荐系统综述缺乏心理学基础的分类体系，且通常只研究特定类型的情感状态或应用领域。

Method: 采用Scherer的情感状态类型学，将系统分为四类：态度感知、情绪感知、心情感知和混合型。记录情感信号提取技术、系统架构和应用领域。

Result: 强调了利用跨不同模式的多种情感状态的混合模型、大规模情感感知数据集的开发，以及用基于认知和社会心理学的更精确的术语替换情感状态的民间词汇的必要性。

Conclusion: 本综述旨在为推进情感驱动的个性化中的学术研究和行业应用提供全面的参考和有用的指导。

Abstract: Affective Recommender Systems are an emerging class of intelligent systems
that aim to enhance personalization by aligning recommendations with users'
affective states. Reflecting a growing interest, a number of surveys have been
published in this area, however they lack an organizing taxonomy grounded in
psychology and they often study only specific types of affective states or
application domains. This survey addresses these limitations by providing a
comprehensive, systematic review of affective recommender systems across
diverse domains. Drawing from Scherer's typology of affective states, we
introduce a classification scheme that organizes systems into four main
categories: attitude aware, emotion aware, mood aware, and hybrid. We further
document affective signal extraction techniques, system architectures, and
application areas, highlighting key trends, limitations, and open challenges.
As future research directions, we emphasize hybrid models that leverage
multiple types of affective states across different modalities, the development
of large-scale affect-aware datasets, and the need to replace the folk
vocabulary of affective states with a more precise terminology grounded in
cognitive and social psychology. Through its systematic review of existing
research and challenges, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference
and a useful guide for advancing academic research and industry applications in
affect-driven personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐系统缺乏细粒度的用户-项目交互和可解释性，并且现有方法要么无法利用预训练Transformer模型的能力，要么适应性差并忽略了方面建模。

Method: 提出ELIXIR，一个多任务模型，结合评分预测与个性化评论生成，联合学习用户和项目的全局和特定方面的表示，优化总体评分、方面级别评分和评论生成，并通过个性化注意力强调方面重要性。基于T5-small模型。

Result: 在TripAdvisor和RateBeer数据集上的实验结果表明，ELIXIR显著优于强大的基线模型，尤其是在评论生成方面。

Conclusion: ELIXIR模型能够有效地生成个性化的推荐解释，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

*Shijia Wang,Tianpei Ouyang,Qiang Xiao,Dongjing Wang,Yintao Ren,Songpei Xu,Da Guo,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态推荐框架，该框架通过显式保留前缀语义特征来生成特定于模态和模态联合的语义ID，并设计了一个多代码本交叉注意网络，以同时捕获模态特定兴趣并感知跨模态相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法存在两个关键限制：1) 模态内语义退化，基于残差的量化过程逐渐将离散ID与原始内容语义分离，导致语义漂移；2) 模态间建模差距，传统的融合策略要么忽略模态特定细节，要么未能捕获跨模态相关性，阻碍了全面的用户兴趣建模。

Method: 首先，使用渐进语义残差量化 (PSRQ) 方法生成模态特定和模态联合语义 ID，通过显式保留前缀语义特征。其次，设计了一个多代码本交叉注意 (MCCA) 网络，以同时捕获模态特定兴趣并感知跨模态相关性。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: 该框架已部署在中国最大的音乐流媒体平台之一上，在线 A/B 测试证实商业指标显着改善，突显了其在工业规模推荐系统中的实际价值。

Abstract: In music recommendation systems, multimodal interest learning is pivotal,
which allows the model to capture nuanced preferences, including textual
elements such as lyrics and various musical attributes such as different
instruments and melodies. Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content
features through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However,
existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic
degradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple
discrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2)
inter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook
modal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering
comprehensive user interest modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multimodal recommendation framework with two stages. In the first stage,
our Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization (PSRQ) method generates
modal-specific and modal-joint semantic IDs by explicitly preserving the prefix
semantic feature. In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a
Multi-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model
to simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal
correlations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This framework has
been deployed on one of China's largest music streaming platforms, and online
A/B tests confirm significant improvements in commercial metrics, underscoring
its practical value for industrial-scale recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统中的查询推荐方法可能会产生关于性别或种族等受保护类别的不良或错误偏见。

Method: 该方法采用Pareto front方法来寻找平衡查询，优化多个目标，如性别偏见和区域偏见，以及返回结果的相关性。

Result: 在Wikipedia数据集上的实验结果证明了该扩展的BalancedQR框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 查询措辞和语言选择对检索结果有显著影响。

Abstract: Modern IR systems are an extremely important tool for seeking information. In
addition to search, such systems include a number of query reformulation
methods, such as query expansion and query recommendations, to provide high
quality results. However, results returned by such methods sometimes exhibit
undesirable or wrongful bias with respect to protected categories such as
gender or race. Our earlier work considered the problem of balanced query
recommendation, where instead of re-ranking a list of results based on fairness
measures, the goal was to suggest queries that are relevant to a user's search
query but exhibit less bias than the original query. In this work, we present a
case study of BalancedQR using an extension of BalancedQR that handles biases
in multiple dimensions. It employs a Pareto front approach that finds balanced
queries, optimizing for multiple objectives such as gender bias and regional
bias, along with the relevance of returned results. We evaluate the extended
version of BalancedQR on a Wikipedia dataset.Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our extension to BalancedQR framework and highlight the
significant impact of subtle query wording,linguistic choice on retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统在检索阶段使用单目标建模，与排序阶段的多目标优化不一致，导致资源消耗高且难以处理松散耦合的目标。

Method: 提出了MPFormer框架，包含目标条件Transformer、个性化目标权重和用户个性化信息融入等机制。

Result: 在快手短视频推荐系统中，显著提高了用户日均互动和系统运营效率。

Conclusion: MPFormer框架能够有效优化多目标检索的迭代模式，同时保持服务响应速度，为工业推荐系统提供可扩展的多目标解决方案。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLMs are used for recommendation but may have bias in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness concerns exist in cold-start recommendation with LLMs due to societal biases.

Method: A benchmark is introduced to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation.

Result: Consistent biases are found across recommendation domains and a non-linear relationship exists between model size and fairness.

Conclusion: Nuanced analysis is needed for fairness in LLM-based recommendation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确检索事实信息对于维护系统可信度和防御 RAG 投毒至关重要。然而，对于这些组件从其所基于的大型语言模型 (LLM) 继承或损失了多少事实能力知之甚少。

Method: 将 12 个公开发布的嵌入检查点与其原始基础 LLM 配对，并在事实基准上评估这两组模型。

Result: 在评估的每个模型中，嵌入变体的准确率都显着低于其基础模型，绝对下降范围为 12 到 43 个百分点（中位数为 28 个百分点），并且典型的检索器准确率下降到 25-35% 范围内，而生成模型则达到 60-70%。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了对比学习为检索器引入的系统性权衡：语义检索的收益是以参数化事实知识的损失为代价的。

Abstract: Dense retrievers and rerankers are central to retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines, where accurately retrieving factual information is crucial for
maintaining system trustworthiness and defending against RAG poisoning.
However, little is known about how much factual competence these components
inherit or lose from the large language models (LLMs) they are based on. We
pair 12 publicly released embedding checkpoints with their original base LLMs
and evaluate both sets on a factuality benchmark. Across every model evaluated,
the embedding variants achieve markedly lower accuracy than their bases, with
absolute drops ranging from 12 to 43 percentage points (median 28 pts) and
typical retriever accuracies collapsing into the 25-35 % band versus the 60-70
% attained by the generative models. This degradation intensifies under a more
demanding condition: when the candidate pool per question is expanded from four
options to one thousand, the strongest retriever's top-1 accuracy falls from 33
% to 26 %, revealing acute sensitivity to distractor volume. Statistical tests
further show that, for every embedding model, cosine-similarity scores between
queries and correct completions are significantly higher than those for
incorrect ones (p < 0.01), indicating decisions driven largely by surface-level
semantic proximity rather than factual reasoning. To probe this weakness, we
employed GPT-4.1 to paraphrase each correct completion, creating a rewritten
test set that preserved factual truth while masking lexical cues, and observed
that over two-thirds of previously correct predictions flipped to wrong,
reducing overall accuracy to roughly one-third of its original level. Taken
together, these findings reveal a systematic trade-off introduced by
contrastive learning for retrievers: gains in semantic retrieval are paid for
with losses in parametric factual knowledge......

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多行为序列推荐模型PDB4Rec，该模型考虑了不同频率的信息，并通过Boostrapping Balancer机制平衡它们的贡献，从而提高推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多行为序列推荐旨在综合考虑用户的不同行为以提高目标行为的推荐性能。然而，一些行为数据也会给用户兴趣建模带来噪声。以往的研究表明低频信息往往更有价值和可靠，而高频信息通常与噪声相关联。本文认为高频信息并非完全不重要。

Method: 提出PDB4Rec模型，该模型有效地提取各种频段的信息及其关系，并引入Boostrapping Balancer机制来平衡它们的贡献。

Result: 在真实数据集上进行了充分的实验，证明了该模型的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 低频对应于用户兴趣的纯度，而高频对应于用户兴趣的多样性。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法通常会以对环境、当地社区或其他利益相关者产生负面影响的方式引导游客流。计算机科学界对现实世界中复杂关系和权衡的理解有限。

Method: 通过半系统的文献综述，整合旅游管理和计算机科学的文献。

Result: 旅游管理积极尝试识别利益相关者的具体需求，并利用定性、包容和参与式方法，从规范和整体的研究角度研究公平性。相比之下，计算机科学缺乏对利益相关者需求的充分理解，主要通过可衡量的歧视等描述性因素来考虑公平性，同时严重依赖于少数无法捕捉旅游业中公平性的多维性质的数学形式化公平性标准。

Conclusion: 纯粹的算法研究存在缺点，未来的跨学科合作具有潜力和特殊需求，这是加强算法决策支持系统，以理解和支持旅游业中真正的多方利益相关者公平性的根本和必要步骤。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular
digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to
explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a
way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other
stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science
community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs
among stakeholders in the real world.
  In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism
management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic
decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize
literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science.
Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the
specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and
participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research
perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of
the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive
factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few
mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the
multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.
  With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of
purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for
future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a
fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems
towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

Motivation: 现有的语义检索系统由于缺乏领域特定信息和依赖过时的知识来源，其精度可能会受到影响。

Abstract: Retrieving pertinent documents from various data sources with diverse
characteristics poses a significant challenge for Document Retrieval Systems.
The complexity of this challenge is further compounded when accounting for the
semantic relationship between data and domain knowledge. While existing
retrieval systems using semantics (usually represented as Knowledge Graphs
created from open-access resources and generic domain knowledge) hold promise
in delivering relevant outcomes, their precision may be compromised due to the
absence of domain-specific information and reliance on outdated knowledge
sources. In this research, the primary focus is on two key contributions- a)
the development of a versatile algorithm- 'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval
using Group Steiner Tree' that incorporates domain information to enhance
semantic-aware knowledge representation and data access, and b) the practical
implementation of the proposed algorithm within a document retrieval system
using real-world data. To assess the effectiveness of the SemDR system,
research work conducts performance evaluations using a benchmark consisting of
170 real-world search queries. Rigorous evaluation and verification by domain
experts are conducted to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results. The
experimental findings demonstrate substantial advancements when compared to the
baseline systems, with precision and accuracy achieving levels of 90% and 82%
respectively, signifying promising improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SUMMA的多模态模型，用于自动处理视频广告成摘要，突出商业价值最高的内容，从而提高它们在抖音搜索广告系统中的理解和排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升短视频平台上查询-广告匹配和相关性排序，提高广告效果和用户体验。现有方法过度依赖高度压缩的视频嵌入，未能有效利用具有高商业价值的多模态信息。

Method: 通过两阶段训练策略开发SUMMA：多模态监督微调，然后使用混合奖励机制进行强化学习。使用包含视频帧和ASR/OCR转录的领域特定数据。

Result: 离线和在线实验表明，与基线相比有显着改进，在线结果表明广告收入统计显着增加了1.5%。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新颖的范例，将多模态信息压缩成代表性文本，从而有效地将视觉广告内容与检索和推荐场景中的用户查询意图对齐。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching
and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising
effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of
multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by
reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To
address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal
Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries
highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their
comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is
developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning
followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on
domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts,
generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate
SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the
candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising
systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over
baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5%
increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for
condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively
aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and
recommendation scenarios.

*Jyoti Narwariya,Priyanka Gupta,Muskan Gupta,Jyotsana Khatri,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）改进基于会话的推荐系统（SR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SR模型通常未能充分利用项目标题或描述中的语义信息，阻碍了会话意图识别和可解释性。

Method: 本文提出了三种利用LLM进行会话推荐的方法：（1）将上下文LLM作为推荐代理；（2）使用LLM生成的表示来对深度学习SR模型进行语义初始化；（3）将LLM与数据驱动的SR模型集成。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LLM的方法在粗略检索方面表现出色，而传统数据驱动技术在细粒度排序方面表现良好。LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成显著优于独立的LLM方法和数据驱动的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM可以有效提升会话推荐系统的性能，特别是通过与传统数据驱动模型相结合的方式。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的对比学习框架，用于长结构化文档检索，该框架能够有效利用结构特征和元素级语义，并在包含结构元数据的数据集上进行了实验，结果表明该方法能够显著提高检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长结构化文档检索中，通常在缺乏显式结构信息的对比学习数据集上微调预训练语言模型，未能有效利用结构特征和元素级语义，并且缺乏包含结构元数据的数据集。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的对比学习框架，利用结构感知学习来保留语义层次结构，并使用掩码元素对齐来实现细粒度的语义区分。此外，该论文还发布了一个包含丰富结构注释的长结构化文档检索数据集。

Result: 在已发布和工业数据集上的大量实验，以及在线A/B测试表明，该方法能够持续提高性能，在BGE-M3上将NDCG@10从73.96%提高到77.84%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的对比学习框架，通过结构感知学习和掩码元素对齐，有效提升了长结构化文档检索的性能，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

*Zechun Niu,Lang Mei,Liu Yang,Ziyuan Zhao,Qiang Yan,Jiaxin Mao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用户感知的无偏学习排序 (ULTR) 框架，旨在解决现有 ULTR 方法忽略用户个性化行为差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ULTR 方法忽略了不同用户在搜索和浏览行为上的差异，导致学习排序模型存在偏差。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的用户感知的逆倾向得分估计器，该方法对每个查询的用户浏览行为分布进行建模，并聚合用户加权的检查概率来确定倾向。

Result: 在半合成数据集和真实数据集上的大量实验验证了本文提出的用户感知估计器的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的用户感知 ULTR 框架能够有效解决用户个性化行为差异带来的偏差问题，并取得了更好的排序效果。

Abstract: Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR), which aims to learn unbiased ranking models
from biased user behavior logs, plays an important role in Web search. Previous
research on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as
position bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work
often assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,
neglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing
behaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR
framework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal
analysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods
are biased when different users have different preferences over queries and
personalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a
personalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score
estimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models
the distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates
user-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We
theoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild
assumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of
calculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression. Finally, we
empirically verify the effectiveness of our user-aware estimator by conducting
extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为深度多重量化网络（DMQN）的模型，用于处理点击率（CTR）预测中的长行为序列，通过量化和压缩长行为序列来提高性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检索到的项目和完整的长行为序列之间存在目标注意力相关性分布的差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 该方法将长行为序列量化为多个码字序列，并结合分层序列转换单元来促进码字序列的交互，然后通过候选项目和码字序列之间的注意力机制输出兴趣向量。为了实现在线服务，码字序列的中间表示被缓存。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上的大量实验表明，DMQN 是有效和高效的。在广告系统中的 A/B 测试表明，DMQN 将点击率提高了 3.5%，RPM 提高了 2.0%。

Conclusion: DMQN 模型能够有效提升点击率预测的性能，并在实际广告系统中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence,
comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a
vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item.
Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage
paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then
extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we
argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between
the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a
performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple
Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end
through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of
long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based
on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is
incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then,
attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the
interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the
codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN
improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

TL;DR: OneRec-V2 addresses the scalability and performance issues of OneRec-V1 by introducing a lazy decoder-only architecture and preference alignment with real-world user interactions, leading to significant improvements in efficiency and user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OneRec-V1 suffers from inefficient computational allocation and limitations in reinforcement learning.

Method: OneRec-V2 employs a lazy decoder-only architecture and incorporates duration-aware reward shaping and adaptive ratio clipping.

Result: OneRec-V2 improves App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% in A/B tests on Kuaishou.

Conclusion: OneRec-V2 advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems
through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an
autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While
OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two
critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient
computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence
encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning
relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy
Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total
computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling
to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions:
Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to
better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.
  Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness,
improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective
recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and
alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the
development of end-to-end recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the scalability of autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs) in multi-domain scenarios by replacing full inter-domain attention with Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE) and Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformer architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck when applied to multi-domain scenarios due to attending to all items across every domain. Systems need to efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer.

Method: The paper proposes two mechanisms: 1) Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE) that focus attention on intra-domain items, and 2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR) for efficient transfer of relevant domain information without full attention maps.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain representations.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了向量嵌入在实际应用中存在的理论限制，即使在简单的查询下，由于嵌入维度的限制，模型也难以返回所有可能的top-k结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是当前向量嵌入被广泛应用于各种检索任务，包括推理、指令跟随和编码等，但现有研究认为其局限性可以通过更好的训练数据和更大的模型来克服。这篇论文旨在证明即使在简单的查询和实际场景中，向量嵌入仍然会遇到理论限制。

Method: 该研究通过连接学习理论中的已知结果，证明了可以作为查询结果返回的top-k文档子集的数量受到嵌入维度的限制。并通过实验验证了即使限制k=2，并在测试集上直接优化参数化嵌入，这一结论仍然成立。此外，作者还创建了一个名为LIMIT的实际数据集，用于测试模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，即使是最先进的模型在LIMIT数据集上也表现不佳，尽管任务很简单。这表明现有单向量范式下的嵌入模型存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明现有单向量范式下的嵌入模型存在根本限制，并呼吁未来的研究开发能够解决这一限制的方法。

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 CrystalICL 的新模型，专为少样本晶体生成而设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计具有所需物理化学性质的晶体材料仍然是材料科学中的一个基本挑战。现有方法无法从少样本情景中受益。

Method: 引入了一种基于空间群的晶体标记化方法，并引入了一种条件结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略。

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准上的大量实验表明，CrystalICL 优于条件和无条件生成任务中的领先基线方法。

Conclusion: CrystalICL 模型在少样本晶体生成方面表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有的基于 Transformer 的模型在 LTSF 任务中表现出色，但存在对低频数据有偏差以及计算和内存需求高等问题。通过引入可学习的频率滤波器，可以增强模型的光谱利用率。

Method: 在基于 Transformer 的模型的开头添加可学习的滤波器，增加约 1000 个参数。

Conclusion: 添加滤波器可以提高基于 Transformer 的模型在预测方面的性能，并更好地利用频谱进行预测。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Motivation: 将Transformer信号解释为条件测度的替代，并将层操作视为不动点更新。

Method: 构建概率模型，将Transformer信号解释为条件测度的替代，并将层操作视为不动点更新。针对概率模型为隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)的特殊情况，描述了不动点更新的显式形式。

Result: 为Transformer信号提供了概率解释，并将其与经典非线性滤波理论联系起来。

Conclusion: 该论文试图将经典非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构联系起来。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准是有效知识蒸馏的一个重要因素，并且可以通过简单地采用校准方法来减少教师模型的校准误差来提高知识蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“损失差异相关性 (CLD)”的简单且可扩展的 coreset 选择指标，该指标通过测量训练样本与预留验证集损失轨迹的对齐程度来识别最具影响力的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景中的可扩展性挑战。

Method: 该方法仅需在训练检查点计算的每个样本的损失值，避免了许多现有子集选择方法中代价高昂的梯度和曲率计算。

Result: 在 CIFAR-100 和 ImageNet-1k 上，基于 CLD 的 coreset 通常优于或接近最先进的方法，并且即使没有领先，也保持在计算成本更高的基线方法的 1% 以内。CLD 可以在架构之间有效地转移，实现 <1% 降级的代理到目标选择。此外，CLD 在仅使用早期检查点时是稳定的，产生的精度损失可忽略不计。最后，CLD 通过每类验证对齐表现出固有的偏差减少，从而无需额外的分层抽样。

Conclusion: CLD 是一种有原则的、高效的、稳定的和可转移的工具，用于可扩展的数据集优化。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Motivation: 研究图结构和节点特定信息之间的协同作用。

Method: 提出了一种新的优化问题，该问题在谱图聚类框架中结合了节点特定信息（标签和特征）。

Result: 结果表明，合适的节点特定信息保证了我们的优化问题的解决方案能够完全恢复社区，其条件比单独对图聚类的约束更温和。

Conclusion: 数值实验证实了这种协同作用。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

TL;DR: INS2ANE通过整合新颖性评分系统和策略性抽样机制，增强了自主实验中新现象的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自主实验主要集中于优化预定义的目标，限制了对意外或未知物理现象的发现。

Method: 该方法整合了两个关键组成部分：(1) 评估实验结果独特性的新颖性评分系统，以及 (2) 即使根据传统标准，促进对欠采样区域进行探索的策略性抽样机制。

Result: INS2ANE 显著增加了探索现象的多样性，与传统的优化程序相比，提高了发现以前未观察到的现象的可能性。

Conclusion: 该结果表明，AE 具有增强科学发现深度的潜力；结合 AE 提供的效率，该方法有望通过同时导航复杂的实验空间来发现新现象，从而加速科学研究。

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从数据中发现方程的过程是物理学以及包括数学生态学和流行病学在内的许多其他研究领域的核心。近年来，称为符号回归的机器学习方法已经使这一过程自动化。由于文献中有几种方法可用，因此比较它们非常重要，特别是对于描述复杂现象的动态系统。

Method: 本文使用了五种符号回归方法从九个动态过程中恢复方程，这些动态过程包括混沌动力学和流行病模型。

Result: PySR方法被证明是最适合推断方程的。基准测试结果表明了其高预测能力和准确性，其中一些估计与原始分析形式无法区分。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了符号回归作为推断和建模真实世界现象的强大工具的潜力。

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因缺失或未测量的协变量带来的挑战，帮助解释影响治疗或结果的隐藏因素。

Method: 将潜在变量模型整合到双重机器学习（DML）范式中。考虑两种情况：一种是潜在变量仅影响结果，另一种是潜在变量可能影响治疗和结果。为确保易处理性，仅在DML的第二阶段纳入潜在变量，将表示学习与潜在推理分离。

Result: 通过在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量实验，证明了该方法的稳健性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在存在隐藏因素的情况下，能够稳健地估计因果效应。

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理复杂、高维遗传数据方面存在困难，而大型语言模型（LLM）在理解非结构化医疗数据方面表现出色。

Method: 在PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv中进行自动关键词搜索，筛选关于LLM在遗传学诊断和教育应用的研究，共分析了172项研究。

Result: LLM在基因组变异识别、注释和解释，以及通过视觉Transformer实现的医学影像进展方面有应用。Transformer模型显著提升了疾病和风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成能力。

Conclusion: LLM正在改变遗传疾病诊断并支持遗传教育，但多模态数据整合、泛化性和临床应用仍然是主要挑战。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络经常受到不可预测的局部性能的影响，这可能会影响它们在关键应用中的可靠性。VC通过提供网络行为中局部值变化的量化指标来解决这个问题，从而深入了解实现神经网络近似的稳定性和性能。

Method: 研究了VC的一些基本理论性质，并提出了基于VC的一种新度量方法，该方法从变动的角度衡量两个函数之间的距离。在此度量标准的基础上，我们进一步提出了一种新的神经网络近似预处理框架。

Result: 数值结果（包括实际实验和与PDE相关的科学问题）支持我们的发现和预处理加速方法。

Conclusion: VC可以表征神经网络近似的局部性能和行为。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Beacon 的简单有效的算法，该算法无需手动调整即可直接执行每通道 PTQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低大型预训练模型的内存和计算成本是量化的主要目的。在per-channel PTQ中，选择合适的缩放因子是一个关键挑战。

Method: Beacon 算法利用对称标量量化的几何特性，自动确定最佳缩放因子，直接使用固定的非缩放字母表执行每通道 PTQ。

Result: Beacon 算法在性能上与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Beacon 算法是一种高效模型部署的实用解决方案，因为它简单、无需调整且性能具有竞争力。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DALI的框架，用于在强化学习中适应未见过的环境条件，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的cMDP方法需要显式的上下文变量，但在上下文潜在或难以测量时受限。

Method: DALI通过训练自监督编码器来预测前向动力学，从而推断潜在的上下文表示，并生成可操作的表示来调节世界模型和策略。

Result: DALI在具有挑战性的cMDP基准测试中实现了显著的收益，通常在推断任务中超过了上下文感知基线，从而实现了对未见过的上下文变化的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: DALI的潜在空间实现了反事实一致性，重力编码维度的扰动以物理上合理的方式改变了想象的rollout。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习方法，称为联邦表征微调（FedReFT），它通过操纵隐藏表征来进行模型微调，并使用All-But-Me（ABM）聚合来解决异构数据下的语义对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法难以应对客户端数据分布、模型容量和计算资源的异构性，而表征微调（ReFT）在联邦学习中的应用仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了FedReFT，它使用稀疏干预层来直接调整隐藏表征，并提出了ABM聚合方法，允许每个客户端接收其他客户端的聚合更新并部分合并它们。

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调整和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT始终优于最先进的联邦学习中的PEFT方法，与领先的基于LoRA的方法相比，参数效率提高了7倍-15倍。

Conclusion: FedReFT是一种轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，非常适合边缘设备，并且在联邦学习环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的内部人才推荐框架，该框架通过分析电子邮件数据，从任务的语义相似性和交互协作的结构特征两个维度对员工的职位匹配度进行建模，并使用双图卷积网络进行融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性限制，容易忽略合格的候选人，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 该框架通过分析电子邮件数据，从WHAT(任务的语义相似性)和HOW(交互协作的结构特征)两个维度对员工的职位匹配度进行建模，这两个维度被表示为独立的图，并使用带有门控机制的双图卷积网络(GCN)进行自适应融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的基于门控的融合模型显著优于其他融合策略和启发式基线，在Hit@100上达到了40.9%的最高性能。该模型还表现出很高的可解释性，能够为不同的工作族群学习不同的、context-aware的融合策略。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个定量和全面的内部人才发现框架，最大限度地降低了传统方法中候选人遗漏的风险。其主要贡献在于能够根据经验确定任务对齐(WHAT)和协作模式(HOW)之间的最佳融合比例，这对于员工在新职位上取得成功至关重要，从而提供重要的实际意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge: Pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on diverse MIP instances without needing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based combinatorial optimization methods need lots of training data and lack generalization.

Method: Pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on diverse MIP instances in an unsupervised way. Uses vector quantization to create a vocabulary for representing instances.

Result: Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances. A single fine-tuned model predicts warm-starts and integrality gaps, improving solver performance.

Conclusion: Forge improves combinatorial optimization by pre-training a model that generalizes across multiple problem types and enhances solver performance. Code and weights are released for further research.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) 的新型LLM投毒攻击方法，该方法利用对齐机制在LLM中注入偏差或强制执行有针对性的审查，而不会降低模型对不相关主题的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）通过训练来拒绝回答有害或不安全的问题，从而符合道德标准和安全要求。然而，本文表明，攻击者可以利用LLM的对齐来植入偏差，或强制执行有针对性的审查，而不会降低模型对不相关主题的响应能力。

Method: 本文提出了Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)，这是一种投毒攻击，它利用对齐机制来触发对攻击者预定义的特定主题或查询的拒绝。

Result: SAI可以绕过最先进的投毒防御措施，包括LLM状态取证，以及旨在检测FL设置中投毒的鲁棒聚合技术。在ChatDoctor等基于聊天的应用程序中，只需1%的数据投毒，系统就会拒绝回答针对特定种族类别的医疗保健问题，从而导致高度偏差。在简历选择流程中，拒绝总结来自选定大学的简历会导致选择上的高度偏差。在其他9个基于聊天的下游应用程序中，也会产生更高的偏差。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效地在LLM中注入偏差，并且能够绕过现有的防御机制，对LLM驱动的应用程序管道构成实际危险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares the performance of Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASC) and panel-style Double Machine Learning (DML) in quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is challenging, SCM often underestimates effect size, while panel-style DML is seldom benchmarked against SCM.

Method: The authors build an open, fully documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out and probe both families under five stylized stress tests.

Result: ASC models consistently demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios, while panel-DML variants dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far more robust.

Conclusion: The authors propose a 'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary business challenge and then select the specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自适应脑电信号分割方法CTXSEG，用于脑电信号的机器学习分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将脑电信号分割成固定长度片段的方法可能生物学相关性有限，因为大脑状态并不局限于固定间隔。

Method: 提出CTXSEG方法，该方法基于脑电数据的统计差异创建可变长度的片段，并提出将其用于需要固定长度输入的现代机器学习方法。

Result: 使用CTXSEG准备脑电数据可以提高癫痫检测性能，并且需要的片段更少。

Conclusion: 自适应分割方法CTXSEG可以很容易地应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力提高性能，是信号预处理中固定长度分割的有希望的替代方案，应被视为脑电机器学习应用中的标准预处理方法。

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 本研究深入理解了对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流的增量学习行为，利用求解Riccati矩阵微分方程得到的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理论研究通常将神经网络的卓越经验性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化假设下训练网络时产生的隐式偏差或正则化。

Method: 通过求解Riccati矩阵微分方程，获得了对称矩阵分解问题的梯度流闭式解。

Result: 结果表明，增量学习源于学习目标矩阵中不同分量之间动态的时间尺度分离。通过减小初始化尺度，这些时间尺度分离变得更加显著，从而可以找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 讨论了将此分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的联邦检索框架，名为DFAMS，它利用动态信息流（DIF）来识别潜在的查询意图，并构建语义对齐的知识分区，以实现跨异构来源的准确检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦检索方法难以检索到高质量和相关的文档，尤其是在跨领域场景中，这限制了它们在支持下游生成任务中的有效性。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法通过利用来自少量带注释查询的梯度信号，并采用基于Shapley值的归因来追踪与意图识别和子域边界检测相关的神经元激活路径，从而探测LLM中的DIF。然后，DFAMS利用DIF通过多原型对比学习来训练对齐模块，从而实现细粒度的源内建模和跨知识库的源间语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率方面优于先进的FR方法高达14.37%，在检索召回率方面优于5.38%，在下游QA准确率方面优于6.45%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，DFAMS在复杂的联邦检索场景中是有效的。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Motivation: 设计人员是否可以在不花费大量时间进行仿真设置的情况下评估给定引擎盖框架几何结构的性能？

Method: 开发一种多模态机器学习（MMML）架构，该架构从相同数据的不同模态中学习以预测性能指标。

Result: 通过结合多个数据模态，MMML 优于传统的单模态方法。使用经过训练的 MMML 模型对两个不属于训练数据集的新框架几何结构进行预测，以展示其推广到未见过的框架模型的能力。

Conclusion: MMML 有潜力补充传统的基于仿真的工作流程，特别是在概念设计阶段，并强调其在弥合机器学习和实际工程应用之间差距的作用。

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Motivation: Airbnb 过去依赖结构化数据，但现在希望利用文本和图像中的丰富信息。将多种非结构化数据（图像、标题、描述、评论）结合成单一表示具有挑战性。

Method: 提出 BiListing 方法，利用大型语言模型和预训练的语言-图像模型对房源的文本和照片进行对齐，将非结构化数据捕获到单个嵌入向量中。

Result: 离线和在线测试表明，BiListing 嵌入在 Airbnb 搜索排名模型中取得了 0.425% 的 NDCG 增益，并带来了数百万美元的增量收入。

Conclusion: BiListing 成功部署到生产环境，提高了搜索排名并增加了收入

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高精度去噪，弥合了心脏数字孪生预处理流程中的关键差距，从而能够实现更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Motivation: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer architecture has a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, which limits its application in long-sequence tasks.

Method: Reconfiguring neuron connection patterns to achieve strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores.

Result: TLinFormer exhibits advantages in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory footprint, and overall speedup.

Conclusion: TLinFormer bridges the performance gap between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Result: 通过在 Swiss roll 和 CelebA 数据集上的实现和实验，展示了如何从架构中获得这些量。

Conclusion: 该正则化技术允许计算学习流形的标量曲率。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Motivation: 理解时间序列预测模型成功或失败的原因仍然具有挑战性。时间序列预测模型越来越多地用于生成信息，从而为具有同等实际后果的现实世界行动提供信息。了解模型的复杂性、性能可变性和不透明性变得很有价值。

Method: 将传统的可解释AI (XAI) 方法与评级驱动解释 (RDE) 相结合，以评估 TSFM 性能和跨不同领域和用例的可解释性。评估了四种不同的模型架构：ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos（时间序列特定基础模型）、Llama（通用；微调和基础模型），这些模型使用了跨越金融、能源、交通和汽车销售领域的四个异构数据集。

Result: 在不稳定或稀疏的领域（例如，电力、汽车零件）中，特征工程模型（例如，梯度提升）始终优于基础模型（例如，Chronos），同时提供更易于理解的解释，而基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的环境（例如，金融）中表现出色。

Conclusion: 特征工程模型在不稳定或稀疏的领域中优于基础模型，而基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Motivation: 当前的状态空间模型（SSM）参数初始化方法主要依赖于 HiPPO 框架，但该框架没有明确研究对角变体的作用。

Method: 从频率角度研究对角 SSM 初始化方案，并提出一种在离散傅里叶域上的对角初始化方法 S4D-DFouT。

Result: 在 Long Range Arena 基准测试中实现了最先进的结果，并允许从头开始在非常大的数据集（如 PathX-256）上进行训练。

Conclusion: 对极点放置在初始化中的作用的理解使得能够进一步扩展模型。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的机器学习方法，可以在不完全重新训练的情况下，从大型语言模型中移除特定数据的影响，同时保持模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练使用的数据集可能包含隐私或受版权保护的内容，因此需要从训练模型中移除这些数据。现有的 machine unlearning 方法存在不足，无法很好地平衡遗忘和模型性能。

Method: 提出 EAGLE-PC 框架，通过 entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting 确定每个样本的遗忘程度，并使用 proxy constraint 减轻 over-forgetting。

Result: 在 TOFU 和 MUSE 基准测试中，EAGLE-PC 在多个大型语言模型上都表现出一致的 forgetting-utility trade-off 改进。与 NPO+GD 优化器结合使用时，其性能接近完全重新训练。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC 提供了一种可扩展且强大的 unlearning 解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的 SHGT 框架，通过捕获高阶依赖关系和利用 Transformer 架构来改进现有 GNN 方法，并在诊断预测方面取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

*Weihai Zhi,Jiayan Guo,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedGR2: A framework for data-efficient learning in medicine that co-develops a data generator and reward model to create high-quality, multi-modal medical data for SFT and RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of high-quality, expert-annotated data hampers the application of VLMs in medicine. Existing datasets often lead to poor generalization, and RL is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals.

Method: Introduces Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR2), a framework that co-develops a data generator and a reward model for automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data.

Result: SFT with MedGR2-produced data surpasses baselines trained on human-curated datasets. RL with this data achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization. A compact model achieves performance competitive with much larger foundation models.

Conclusion: MedGR2 presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the potential of RL for building generalizable medical AI.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是克服传统方法中仅设置单一指标的局限性，以实现准确性、排序质量、输出多样性和算法资源强度之间的平衡。

lies in the development of a universal multi-criteria optimization tool that is
applicable not only in recommendation systems, but also in a wide range of
machine learning and data analysis tasks.

### [182] [MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20577)
*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化器MERIT，它利用最大范数来计算信任比，以更有效地约束最大注意力logit。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器（如AdamW）在语言模型的大批量训练过程中存在性能下降，这是由于最大注意力logit急剧增加导致注意力层中存在信息瓶颈。虽然LAMB优化器部分解决了这个问题，但一些注意力层仍然面临这个问题。原因是LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比在直接影响query/key权重的最大值方面效果较差。此外，LAMB中基于权重的信任比容易出错，因为它忽略了行或列中权重值之间的关系。

Method: 提出了一种新的优化器MERIT，它利用最大范数来计算信任比，以更有效地约束最大注意力logit。此外，本文还构建了element-wise信任比，通过关注局部权重结构来提供更鲁棒的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种大小的GPT-2模型上进行的大批量训练的大量实验表明，MERIT具有优越的性能。值得注意的是，在GPT-2 Medium的训练过程中，与标准批大小（480）和48B训练tokens相比，MERIT能够实现6k的批大小，而不会降低任何性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批量训练中考虑最大注意力logit和更细粒度的信任比的重要性。它成功地提高了训练稳定性，并为更大的批量使用铺平了道路，从而能够更快地开发和迭代大型语言模型。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于高斯过程精确随机推断的算法，在高斯过程(GPs)中，当内存资源限制了可行的批处理大小和可能的诱导点数量时，该算法比现有方法实现了更好的实验结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高斯过程(GPs)随机超参数学习方法依赖于近似，例如计算有偏随机梯度或在随机变分推理中使用诱导点。但是，当我们使用这种方法时，我们不能保证收敛到真实边际似然的平稳点。

Method: 我们提出了用于精确随机推断的算法，该算法具有能够产生适度有限维的再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的核。我们的方法也可以扩展到无限维RKHS，但代价是放弃精确性。

Result: 对于有限和无限维RKHS，当内存资源限制了可行的批处理大小和可能的诱导点数量时，我们的方法比现有方法实现了更好的实验结果。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种用于高斯过程精确随机推断的算法

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为局部虚拟节点（LVN）的方法，以缓解图神经网络中过度压缩的问题，而不会显著改变输入图的全局结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理涉及长程依赖的任务时面临过度压缩的挑战。现有的图重布线和添加虚拟节点的方法会改变输入图的全局拓扑，从而破坏原始图结构中编码的领域知识。

Method: 该研究提出使用具有可训练嵌入的局部虚拟节点（LVN），其位置由节点中心性决定，以改善潜在瓶颈区域的连接性。可训练的LVN嵌入在选定的中心区域共享，促进远距离节点之间的通信，而无需添加更多层。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，LVN可以增强结构连接性，并显着提高图和节点分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的局部虚拟节点（LVN）方法有效地缓解了图神经网络中的过度压缩问题，同时保持了输入图的全局结构。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于任务的方法来评估抽样调查的可信度，该方法通过引入模型特定的距离度量来量化可信度，并设计了一种算法来验证回归模型中调查数据的可信度，其样本复杂度与数据维度无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估抽样调查是否可信地代表总体，对于确保下游研究的有效性至关重要。通常，这个问题简化为估计两个高维分布之间的距离，这通常需要样本数量随维度呈指数增长。

Method: 提出了一种基于任务的方法，引入模型特定的距离度量来量化可信度，并设计了一种算法来验证回归模型中调查数据的可信度。

Result: 该算法的样本复杂度与数据维度无关。如果试图通过重建回归模型来验证可信度，则样本复杂度会随着数据的维度线性缩放。并通过数值证明了算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论上是正确的，并且在数值上证明了其性能。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

TL;DR: 本文研究了掩码自动编码器（MAE）在1D超声信号上的自监督表征学习，发现预训练模型显著优于从头开始训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业应用中，标记数据稀缺且信号处理具有高度任务特异性，因此需要研究在1D超声信号上使用MAE。

Method: 利用MAE在未标记的合成超声信号上进行预训练，从而学习鲁棒的表征，以提高下游任务的性能。研究了模型大小、patch大小和掩蔽率对预训练效率和下游精度的影响。

Result: 预训练模型显著优于从头开始训练的模型和优化的卷积神经网络（CNN）基线。与仅在有限的真实数据集上训练相比，在合成数据上进行预训练表现出更好的迁移性。

Conclusion: MAE具有通过可扩展的自监督学习来推进超声信号分析的潜力。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Method: Introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, along with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server.

Result: GDS agent can solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks; benchmark introduced to evaluate tool calls and final responses.

Conclusion: GDS agent enhances LLMs in graph tasks, but challenges remain, and a future roadmap is discussed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Result: 理论分析表明，TV-HSGT可以实现改进的动态后悔界，而无需假设梯度有界性。在logistic回归任务上的实验结果证实了TV-HSGT在动态和资源受限环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法在动态和资源受限环境中，对于时变有向网络，在不需要梯度有界假设的情况下， 能够有效降低梯度方差，更准确地跟踪全局下降方向，实现改进的动态后悔界。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Method: 提出VarDiU（变分扩散上界），它允许无偏梯度估计器，可以直接应用于扩散蒸馏。

Result: VarDiU 方法可以实现更高质量的生成，并实现更有效和稳定的单步扩散蒸馏训练过程。

Conclusion: VarDiU 是一种有效的扩散蒸馏方法，可以提高生成质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Conclusion: 对序贯器官衰竭评估 (SOFA) 评分的预测任务的额外下游评估表明，与基于原始数据进行训练相比，当模型训练完全基于组合合成数据时，性能显着提高。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)的风险在于通过微调进行有害的滥用。我们证明了强化学习(rl)能更有效地打破安全alignment，并促进高级有害任务的辅助。我们提出TokenBuncher来对抗这种新兴威胁，TokenBuncher通过约束不确定性来抑制模型响应不确定性，从而使基于rl的微调无法利用不同的奖励信号来驱动模型产生有害行为。通过在多个模型和rl算法上进行的大量实验表明，TokenBuncher可以有效地缓解有害的rl微调，同时保持良性任务的效用和可微调性。

Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)的能力不断增长，通过微调进行有害滥用的风险也在增加。以往的研究主要假设攻击者依赖于有监督的微调(sft)来进行这种滥用，但我们系统地证明了强化学习(rl)能够使攻击者在匹配的计算预算下，更有效地打破安全alignment，并促进高级有害任务的辅助。

Method: 我们提出TokenBuncher，这是一种专门针对基于rl的有害微调的有效防御方法。TokenBuncher抑制了rl所依赖的基础:模型响应不确定性。我们通过entropy-as-reward rl和token noiser机制来实现这种防御，该机制旨在防止专家领域有害能力的升级。

Result: 在多个模型和rl算法上进行的大量实验表明，TokenBuncher可以有效地缓解有害的rl微调，同时保持良性任务的效用和可微调性。

Conclusion: 基于rl的有害微调比sft构成了更大的系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了一种有效且通用的防御方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

*Shaocong Wang,Tong Liu,Ming Li,Minjing Yu,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的自监督 EEG 表征学习方法 (EEGDM)，利用 EEG 信号生成作为自监督目标，将扩散模型转化为能够捕获 EEG 语义的强大表征学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑电信号表征学习方法通常依赖于简单的掩蔽重建目标，可能无法完全捕捉脑电信号中固有的丰富语义信息和复杂模式，从而导致在有限的训练数据下，跨不同任务的泛化性能不佳。

Method: 设计了一个脑电编码器，将脑电信号及其通道增强提炼成紧凑的表征，作为条件信息来指导扩散模型生成脑电信号。这种设计赋予了 EEGDM 一个紧凑的潜在空间。

Result: EEGDM 能够重建高质量的脑电信号，有效地学习鲁棒的表征，并且在不同的下游任务中以适度的预训练数据规模实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: EEGDM 具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 工具增强的语言模型正在重塑AI，但其理论优势仍有待探索。本文旨在通过证明工具学习（外部检索）相对于权重学习（记忆）在事实回忆方面的优势来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨工具增强语言模型（尤其是外部检索）的理论优势，并论证其在事实回忆方面优于单纯记忆。

Method: 通过理论证明和受控实验，比较工具使用模型和记忆模型在事实回忆方面的性能。此外，还研究了预训练大型语言模型中，工具使用教学与微调事实记忆的效果。

Result: 证明了模型仅通过权重记忆事实的数量受到参数数量的限制，而工具使用可以通过简单有效的电路构造实现无限的事实回忆。实验验证了工具使用模型始终优于记忆模型。对于预训练的大型语言模型，工具使用教学和通用规则比将事实微调到记忆中更有效。

Conclusion: 工具增强的工作流程不仅实用，而且在可扩展性方面更具优势，为工具增强的语言模型提供了理论和实证基础。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for machine unlearning in diffusion models.

Method: Maximizes entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by halting its denoising process. Selectively focuses on early diffusion steps.

Result: Demonstrates the effectiveness of SAFEMax and its efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SAFEMax is effective and efficient for machine unlearning in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的上下文多智能体强化学习框架，通过利用大型语言模型生成有意义的课程，并引入基于多样性的上下文混合机制来提升泛化性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文多智能体强化学习方法依赖于不可靠的代理信号，在多智能体环境中存在噪声和不稳定性。

Method: 该论文提出了Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D)框架，使用大型语言模型生成课程，并引入基于多样性的上下文混合机制。

Result: 在交通信号控制领域的实验表明，cMALC-D 显著提高了泛化性和样本效率。

Conclusion: cMALC-D 框架在上下文多智能体强化学习中表现出色，优于现有的课程学习基线。

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at
https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.
