While scaling laws for\ntraining have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now\nrepresent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,\nparticularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of\ncompute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens\nin isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating\npoints. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general\nframework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned\nskill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range\nof inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought\n(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and\nmodel capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite\ngraph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge\nDS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We\ntheoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy\nscaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies\nas a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior\nelicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;\nand both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified\nanalytical framework.

Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not\nwholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation\nspace-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly\naccessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior."}

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves\nconsistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked\nmodeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods."}

The method represents semantic\nfeatures in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a\ndynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule\nlayers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures\nbetween semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional\nfeature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial\nsemantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through\nan iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based\nmechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's\nability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using\na public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are\nused for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms\ntraditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,\nF1-score, and intent detection rate.

Among the methods proposed to solve this task,\nthose relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the\npatterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify\nmeaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a\nfunction that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations.

However, moral\nself-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite\nempirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of\nself-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.\nSecond, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of\ntheir output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency\nduring their self-correction process. To better understand and address these\nparadoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora\ndesigned to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the\nheuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral\nself-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic\nshortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during\nself-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both\nself-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,\nwe propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the\nheuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges\nof this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and\nmodel scales."}

A virtual agent can generate motion\nresponses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or\nmotion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise\ngeneration paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods\nhave limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral\nunderstanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time\nand realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based\nframe-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with\nbetter interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion\nprediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index\nprediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,\nachieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction\nrealism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed\nconversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track\ndual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through\nbidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over\nlong ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU\nto understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that\nexist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final\nprogressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the\neffectiveness of our model."}

This decomposition enables specialized\nprocessing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs\nfor global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to\nrefine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios.\nNotably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving\ndownsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory,\nthereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations\nacross multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency.

Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual\nsegmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined\ndiffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a\nregion-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style.\nOur approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark,\nsignificantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To\nenable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks:\nGlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex\ntypesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in\nsmall-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms\nexisting methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at\nsmall text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong\ngeneralization and deployment readiness."}

Stylometry has been\nused extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.\nBy applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing\npatterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,\nwith (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs\n(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text\nsummarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods\n(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results\nreached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the\nmulticlass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary\nclassification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up\nto .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset.
