However, despite the widespread use of RDBs\nacross various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders\ntheir ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among\nmultiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key\nrelationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or\nconstructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations\namong different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for\npredictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified\npredictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary\ndependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,\nand propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns\nfor prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism\ninto RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite\ndependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive\nfield of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model\nbehaviors and practical guidelines for future applications.

Although existing methods have demonstrated\npromising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional\nmotif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif\ninteractions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose\nan Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for\n\\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from\nboth global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules\ninto functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are\ncombined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,\nstarting from the local structure representation.

In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated\nas a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the\ngoal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy\nconsumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a\ntwo-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication\ntopologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance\nand energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware\nmodel aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data\nheterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60 (DFL) \u6846\u67b6 Hat-DFed\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60 (FL) \u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97 (EC) \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f17\u591a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u591f\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (AI) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60 (DFL) \u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u7b49 (P2P) \u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5404\u79cd DFL \u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u957f\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u672c\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d7\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9 EC \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548 DFL \u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u4f73\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u80fd\u8017", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Hat-DFed\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60 (DFL) \u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5728 Hat-DFed \u4e2d\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efa\u88ab \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cc\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f NP-hard\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u4f73\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

Obtaining good\napproximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a\ndifficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,\nmultiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their\nfitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness\nlandscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances.

Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

Rather than prompting the\nLLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically\nrich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment\nbetween a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input\ncomplexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver\nfine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode\nmatch. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge\nmatched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a\nvariant using raw listening histories.

We present a novel theoretical framework that\nreinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our\nmodel finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which\nsimplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate\nthat attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements\nof classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional\nstimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that\ncontain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention\noperation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where\nCS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our\nframework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized\nmodel: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store\nO($\\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an\nerror propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of\nbalancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and\n(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance\ntransformer architectures.

By crafting universal steering images that induce target\nactivation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving\nmodalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual\ninstructions.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated\nIslamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of\nthought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks\nthe distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate\nabstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on\ntheir ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention\nexperiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal\nschools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,\nGemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for\nminimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a\nperformance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning\nfor languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school\nof thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic\njurisprudence queries.

The variation\nprotocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --\nyielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's\no1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy\ndrops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The\nremaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with\nnon-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and\nhighlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement \"boxed\" accuracy\nwith Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores\nreasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations.

Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict.

However,\nVFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for\nsegmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are\ncritical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM\nwith seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.\nConsequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,\nachieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We\nfurther present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which\nleverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the\nheatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,\noptimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we\npropose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt\nembeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy\nof dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on\nan echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the\nsuperiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and\nindicator measurements.

We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from\ntokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task\nevaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed\nacross tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment\nand tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in\nTelugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600\nderivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.\n  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates\npositively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such\nas Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.\nHowever, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.\nUnigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance\nthan morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others\nacross most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological\nsegmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In\ncontrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\\'enyi entropy\nshowed no correlation with downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46tokenizer\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684tokenization\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u7c7b\u578b\u591a\u6837\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff1aTelugu\uff08\u7c98\u7740\u8bed\uff09\u3001Hindi\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u878d\u5408\u8bed\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7c98\u7740\u8bed\uff09\u548cEnglish\uff08\u878d\u5408\u8bed\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ecetokenizer\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u5728tokenizer\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548ctokenization\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30Telugu\u4e2dtokenizers\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u6d3e\u751f\u8bcd\u548c7000\u4e2a\u5c48\u6298\u8bcd\u7684gold morpheme\u5206\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0ctokenizer\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cnaive Unigram tokenizers\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6tokenizer\uff0c\u4f46\u5728BPE\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6df7\u5408tokenizers\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8bed\u6599\u5e93token\u8ba1\u6570(CTC)\u548cR'enyi\u71b5\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f9d\u5b58\u5173\u7cfb\u89e3\u6790\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46Tokenizer\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Byte-pair Encoding vs. Unigram\uff09\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cnaive Unigram tokenizers\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6tokenizer\uff0c\u4f46\u5728BPE\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6df7\u5408tokenizers\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8bed\u6599\u5e93token\u8ba1\u6570(CTC)\u548cR'enyi\u71b5\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating\nrealistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major\nchallenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches\nfrequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,\nmulti-dimensional evaluation frameworks.\n  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art\nopen-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by\nstructured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from\nexample-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and\ndomain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework\nfeatures a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated\ndata across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy\npreservation.\n  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,\nCirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt\nengineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with\nrule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM\nestablishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with\nrobust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is\nboth clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more\neffective data sharing in healthcare research.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynLLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u969c\u788d\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u548c\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ecf\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 SynLLM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528 20 \u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f00\u6e90 LLM\uff08\u5305\u62ec LLaMA\u3001Mistral \u548c GPT \u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u533b\u7597\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u4ece\u793a\u4f8b\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f1a\u663e\u7740\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u6307\u6807\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

While existing methods can generate visually compelling\nvideos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground\nsubject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,\nwe propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework\nthat explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and\naction from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these\nelements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system\nand perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the\npossibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything\nanywhere.

However, their reasoning processes\nremain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and\ntrustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,\nand medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nframework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static\nCoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy\nlearning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured\nreasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting\nthe answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based\nrewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic\nforgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly\nimproves generalization while producing more explainable and\nhuman-understandable reasoning steps.

AAA-level Simulation: We design\na highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based\nshift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS\ninteractive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical\nautoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into\nopen-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the\nVDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive\nvideo generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from\ndifferent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to\nblend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to\nuser prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that\nexplicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,\nenabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through\ntext. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing\ninteractive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a\ncomprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the\nnext generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

Kim"], "title": "Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual\nrecognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner.

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction.

While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware\nSpatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph\nconvolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network\nto effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and\n(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both\nexpected mean values and associated uncertainties.

Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt.

To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions.

This substantial divergence in\nmethodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the\nlack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that\nnaturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding\ndivide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports\nboth source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from\nall prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct\nconsequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted\nadaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic\nprobabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring\nhow humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each\nimage can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and\na spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

However, they lag behind when translating into\nlow-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and\nsupervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by\nthe size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common\ntechnique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most\nfrequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are\nautomatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the\nexistence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily\navailable for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \\textsc{TopXGen}, an\nLLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in\nmultiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse\nparallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward\nmodels (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human\nvalues, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical\nfor effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer\nlimited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are\ninflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim\nfor improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level\nattribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\\textbf{SARM}), a novel\narchitecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a\nreward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an\ninterpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head\naggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually\nmeaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM\nfacilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows\ndynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment\nperformance compared to conventional reward models.

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation\nis more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex\nbody structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts.

We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style\nexperts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them\nthrough TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,\nTiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp\nand merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing\nstrict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.\nWe also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are\nexplicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained\nmeasurement of temporal hallucinations.

However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,\nrendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute\ngenerated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus\nundermining privacy leakage accountability\n  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership\nAudit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content\nin a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the\nenvironmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an\nattribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which\nrobustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through\nlarge-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,\nSMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs\ninto textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the\ntext modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on\nimage retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of\nmembership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the\ncontent is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data\nprovenance in complex generative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u6210\u5458\u5ba1\u8ba1 (SMA) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3 RAG \u548c MRAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u6eaf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210 (RAG) \u53ca\u5176\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210 (MRAG) \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u8d23\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6270\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8f93\u5165 tokens \u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSMA \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5f52\u56e0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 MLLM \u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0 token \u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u8fd9\u9996\u6b21\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86 MRAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "SMA \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86 MRAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u6210\u5458\u5ba1\u8ba1 (SMA) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u534a\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up\nto 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within\n1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant\nacceleration without compromising generation quality.
