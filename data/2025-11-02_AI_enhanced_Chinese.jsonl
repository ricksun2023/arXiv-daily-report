By treating pieces as features and systematically\nablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the\nengines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This\nmethod draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess\npositions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI\ntechniques.

Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output.

Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal\nCombining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting\ntransformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform\nsolutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds.

The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Specifically, we generate concise textual user\nprofiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual\nembeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item\ngraph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss\nfunction that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine\nsimilarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative\nfeedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens\n100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users\nwith limited interaction history.

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u51fa\u884c\u4e2d\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u51fa\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u4eab\u51fa\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Xu et al.

This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

However,\nSFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task\nsolution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,\nweakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream\nRL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data\nconstruction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to\nquantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical\nstudy finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes\nbetter than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose\nSPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples\nmultimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via\nself-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;\n(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,\ntransferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than\nmemorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep\nreasoning results.

However, challenges\nremain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads\nto high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that\nscale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant\ninference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nMixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a\nsparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while\ncontrolling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise\nrouter-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert\nnetworks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific\nfeatures. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture\ncommon properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final\noutput is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated\nexperts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE\ndatasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%\nreduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated\nparameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that\ndataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which\nvalidates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08MoE-POT\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6c42\u89e3PDE\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3PDE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u9ad8\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u5f0f\u8def\u7531\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7PDE\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u51b3\u7b56\u63a8\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Kim"], "title": "PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse\ndomains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led\nto increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose\ninternal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong\nperformance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft\nprompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial\ndata points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and\n(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency\nwithin each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization.

Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family.

In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting\noverall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention\n(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes\nnon-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces\nStuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that\nenables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or\npassenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture.

If this\npowerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,\nthen it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is\naccountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent\nabout its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and\nif the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's\nAI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with\nit, let alone sanction it.

However,\ncurrent OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS\ninvolves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,\nand (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a\ncritical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,\ncompiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we\npresent OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured\nmanagement and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly\nintegrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models\n(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we\nconstruct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,\nwhich is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,\ncleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M\nsingle-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts.

Trainium, an AI\naccelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an\nattractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous\narchitecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance\ncan be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special\nrequirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix\nmultiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on\nTrainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on\nkernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the\nsoftware-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive\nmatrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show\nthat our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by\nAWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x\nspeedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to\n2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aAWS\u5f00\u53d1\u7684AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668Trainium\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08matmul\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528Trainium\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u91c7\u7528 systolic \u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e03\u5c40\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9488\u5bf9Trainium\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5185\u6838\u878d\u5408\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316SRAM\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8f6c\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eAWS\u5728Trainium\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6700\u65b0matmul\uff1a\u5728matmul\u5185\u6838\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57471.35\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe2.22\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u57471.66\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe2.49\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728Trainium\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a\nunified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses\nwithout requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D\nGaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization\nstrategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity\nand pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization\ninto two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via\ndifferentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses\nusing a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and\nphotometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection\nerrors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations\nand sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6WOD-E2E\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807RFS\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u5e38\u89c4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u6216\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E)\uff0c\u5305\u542b4,021\u4e2a\u9a7e\u9a76\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1aRater Feedback Score (RFS)\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6240\u6709WOD-E2E\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6807\u7b7e\u5df2\u7528\u4e8e2025 WOD-E2E Challenge\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational\nconvergence can inadvertently cause \"cultural erasure\", the functional loss of\nproviding culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query\nlanguage. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing\na holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which\nquantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.\nUsing this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they\nconsistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural\nlocalization across all six languages studied.

Geospatial\nFoundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse\nspatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be\nefficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the\npredictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population\nDynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite\nimagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine\nhealth programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to\ntraditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data\nfrom 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance\nwith R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold\ncross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the\nembedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13\nof 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three\nembedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average\n5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),\nnew HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,\n0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with\nlow primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results\ndemonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for\nselect health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context.

To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained.

Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods\nin terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference\nspeed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends\nits core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios.

Their prevalence, features, and\nclinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and\ndeploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in\nradiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior\nthyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from\nJuly 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline\nidentified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from\nmultiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of\nITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer\ndiagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related\nfactors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more\nlikely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was\nordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were\nmore likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule\ncharacteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other\nfeatures in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers.

Although MLPs have been used to solve\nlinear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing\nattention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including\nthose based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial\ndifferential equations.

In this paper, we define the dataless setting and\ncategorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a\nsingle datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic\nmethods and (ii) architecture-specific methods.

We address this by\nintroducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a\nbenchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,\nrespondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and\nmultiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing\nan effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%\npoints compared to suboptimal formats.

In this paper, we demonstrate why\nInfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a\nsimple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI\nestimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling\nconsistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with\nsignificantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using\nproper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the\nlog score is employed.

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections.

Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we\ntook the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point\nand developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with\none of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10\ndifferent prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using\ndifferent majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of\ninstances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses.

To bridge these extremes, we\nintroduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for\ninfrequent exploration.

Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this\ntask presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature\nof sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of\nlarge-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with\nheuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in\ngeneralizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(DLM)\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53eb\u505a\u201c\u66f4\u65b0\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u4e0a\u7684token\u7ea7\u522b\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u62b9\u53bb\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6270\u4e71\u7d2f\u79ef\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u8868\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49token\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u5173\u952etoken\u88ab\u63d0\u524d\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684token\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTTA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(DLM)\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53eb\u505a\u201c\u66f4\u65b0\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u4e0a\u7684token\u7ea7\u522b\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u62b9\u53bb\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6270\u4e71\u7d2f\u79ef\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u7684token\u6392\u5e8f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u8868\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49token\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u5173\u952etoken\u88ab\u63d0\u524d\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684token\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u6216\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u7eaf\u7cb9\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cdDLM\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\uff0cTTA\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u5230\u4e94\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\uff1b\u5728\u89e3\u6bd2\u65b9\u9762\uff0cTTA\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u6bd2\u6027(12.2 vs 14.5)\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6(26.0 vs 32.0)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u5206\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u51cf\u8f7b\u66f4\u65b0\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models.

Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples.

These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools.

Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics.

Furthermore, we show that even\nwithout explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their\nnames in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in\nlarger models compared to the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u542b\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u683c\u83b1\u65af\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u548c\u5173\u8054\u7406\u8bba\u7b49\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u5177\u5907\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\u9690\u542b\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4eba\u9645\u4ea4\u6d41\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u8ff0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u542b\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe9.6%\u7684\u5206\u6570\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u63d0\u53ca\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u7ea61-3%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u542b\u610f\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual\nretrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain\ncross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate\naccuracy alone does not reveal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u914d\u7f6e\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51cf\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u5728\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ece\u8f83\u5927\u7684VLM\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684VLM\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528KD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86CLIP\u548cSigLIP2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u79cd\u84b8\u998f\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51cf\u534a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u914d\u7f6e\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u9760\u805a\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice.

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated\nCurriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain\nexperts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a\ncomprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for\na subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's\ntaxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing\ndifficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining\nwith an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content\nand cognitive dimensions.\n  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized\nMMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines\nstruggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target\ndomains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage\npoints.

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT.

However, most existing\nLLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely\nneglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for\nreal-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often\nlimited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.\nThis issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address\nthis gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational\nbenchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.\nThe data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge\ndimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K\nentries, respectively.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks.

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process.

Our approach\noperates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization\npattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,\nconditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is\nits use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text\nas an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the\ninput's vector representation.\n  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we\ndemonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying\non complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting\nwhere the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided\ncandidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic\narchitectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield\nsignificant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.\nThese findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for\naccurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e0c\u4f2f\u6765\u8bed\u52a0\u6807\u7cfb\u7edfDIVRIT\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e0c\u4f2f\u6765\u8bed\u7684\u52a0\u6807\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u53d1\u97f3\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u6587\u672c\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u672a\u53d1\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u672a\u52a0\u6807\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u52a0\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002DIVRIT \u7684\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5e0c\u4f2f\u6765\u8bed\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u672a\u52a0\u6807\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u53d8\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u4fe1\u606f\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6267\u884c\u52a0\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u201coracle\u201d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u52a0\u6807\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\uff0cDIVRIT \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5e0c\u4f2f\u6765\u8bed\u52a0\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
