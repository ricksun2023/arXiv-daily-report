*Shengjia Zhang,Jiawei Chen,Changdong Li,Sheng Zhou,Qihao Shi,Yan Feng,Chun Chen,Can Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization to address the limitations of SL and CCL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SL exhibits high sensitivity to false negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization.

Method: proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization

Result: both can be viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts

Conclusion: DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

### [2] [Next-User Retrieval: Enhancing Cold-Start Recommendations via Generative Next-User Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15267)
*Yu-Ting Lan,Yang Huo,Yi Shen,Xiao Yang,Zuotao Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Next-User Retrieval, a transformer-based framework for cold-start recommendations that generates potential users to interact with new items, improving performance in Douyin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommendation systems struggle to address item cold-start challenges due to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions. Traditional lookalike algorithms face limitations in modeling lookalike users and utilizing interaction signals.

Method: A transformer-based model is employed to capture the unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these sequences to generate the next potential user. Additional item features are also integrated as prefix prompt embeddings.

Result: Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Next-User Retrieval, with increases of 0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Next-User Retrieval, a novel framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user modeling, which shows significant improvements in daily active users and publications in Douyin.

Abstract: The item cold-start problem is critical for online recommendation systems, as
the success of this phase determines whether high-quality new items can
transition to popular ones, receive essential feedback to inspire creators, and
thus lead to the long-term retention of creators. However, modern
recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due
to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are
non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.
Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new
items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such
limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further
improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)
struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features
in modern recommendation systems.
  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel
framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user
modeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the
unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these
sequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact
with the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix
prompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of
Next-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online
A/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of
0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin,
showcasing its practical applicability and scalability.

### [3] [Multi-Interest Recommendation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15284)
*Zihao Li,Qiang Chen,Lixin Zou,Aixin Sun,Chenliang Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper surveys multi-interest recommendation, addressing its importance, key aspects, and applications, providing a framework for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical scenarios.

Method: systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future directions of multi-interest recommendation

Result: The survey answers three questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with the technical details of the representative modules?

Conclusion: This survey establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for researchers interested in multi-interest recommendation.

Abstract: Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted
preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as
the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical
scenarios. Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting
multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling
fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has
drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current
recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation
methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this
work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future
directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three
questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for
recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in
recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with
the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey
establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for
researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The
implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is

### [4] [DiscRec: Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative Modeling for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15576)
*Chang Liu,Yimeng Bai,Xiaoyan Zhao,Yang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DiscRec disentangles semantic and collaborative signals in generative recommendation using item-level position embeddings and a dual-branch module, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative recommendation methods suffer from token-item misalignment and semantic-collaborative signal entanglement, limiting recommendation performance.

Method: DiscRec introduces item-level position embeddings and a dual-branch module with a gating mechanism to disentangle and fuse semantic and collaborative signals.

Result: DiscRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DiscRec effectively decouples semantic and collaborative signals, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a powerful paradigm that directly
generates item predictions, moving beyond traditional matching-based
approaches. However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item
misalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity
that is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative
signal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct
distributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to
conflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.
  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables
Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for
generative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position
embeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling
explicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec
employs a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding
layer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token
embeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted
to tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A
gating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's
ability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these
signals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes are
available on https://github.com/Ten-Mao/DiscRec.

### [5] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new corpus for adverse event extraction in elderly patients is presented, highlighting challenges in detecting rare events and nuanced clinical language, despite strong performance on coarse-grained extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. Address challenges rarely tackled in prior work, such as discontinuous and overlapping entities.

Method: Manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities.

Result: Dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs, transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675).

Conclusion: Transformer-based models achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction, but performance drops for fine-grained entity-level tasks, particularly for rare events and complex attributes.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [6] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoostCD combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases to improve the quality of constrained decoding at test time. It outperforms prior approaches in closed information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model  M to map unstructured input text x to output text y representing structured objects, where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs y. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time.

Method: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction.

Result: The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance.

Conclusion: BoostIE outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst, a weakly supervised framework, assesses context document credibility for LLM inference, improving accuracy and F1 score, even under high noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information.

Method: a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. two integration strategies: a black-box approach and a white-box method.

Result: CrEst achieves up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces MDBench, a new multi-document reasoning dataset for evaluating LLMs, created through a novel synthetic generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. Few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in the multi-document setting. The multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs.

Method: A novel synthetic generation process operating on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges.

Result: Introduces MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. The knowledge-guided generation technique allows readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

Conclusion: MDBench poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. The knowledge-guided generation technique allows for targeted analysis and can be adapted quickly.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

TL;DR: This paper explores using LLMs for diabetes prediction, finding that proprietary LLMs outperform open-source models and traditional ML methods in some cases, but further improvements are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored for diabetes prediction.

Method: The study tests the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. Six LLMs, including Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-2B, GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0, are evaluated using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). Their performance is compared with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used as evaluation metrics.

Result: Proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Conclusion: Proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting

TL;DR: LLMs can perfectly reconstruct text using a special memory token embedding, enabling potential applications in memory, compression, and controlled generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of generating reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly.

Method: Introducing a special memory token and optimizing its embedding through training on a fixed sequence.

Result: Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences of up to 240 tokens in English and Spanish. Model scales ranged from 100M to 8B parameters.

Conclusion: LLMs can reconstruct original text exactly using reversible sentence embeddings with a special memory token.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

TL;DR: 该研究使用NLP技术识别自杀案例中与社会隔离和孤独相关的因素，发现男性、同性恋或离婚的人更容易受到慢性社会隔离的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，社会隔离和孤独感日益严重，与自杀率密切相关。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典开发和监督学习分类器。

Result: 通过评估2002年至2020年的30万起自杀事件，发现1198起提到了慢性社会隔离。男性、同性恋或离婚的死者更有可能被归类为慢性社会隔离。

Conclusion: NLP技术可以识别美国国家暴力死亡报告系统(NVDRS)中与社会隔离和孤独相关的结构，从而改进对美国社会隔离和孤独的监测和预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT, a scoring model, improves open-ended long-form generation evaluation and training by providing better reward feedback in GRPO, leading to more human-aligned responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for open-ended long-form generation often miss key aspects and are biased. This paper proposes PrefBERT to address this gap.

Method: PrefBERT, a scoring model trained on response evaluation datasets, is used to provide semantic reward feedback in GRPO.

Result: PrefBERT offers better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Policy models trained with PrefBERT yield responses better aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: PrefBERT is a reliable reward signal for training policy models, leading to responses better aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [13] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how knowledge encoding during training impacts the ability to unlearn factual knowledge in LLMs. The findings suggest that paraphrasing improves unlearning, while unlearning specific facts from text chunks is difficult. Learning-time knowledge encoding is crucial for reliable unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to unlearn has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content.

Method: Empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge.

Result: Learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance, and unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

TL;DR: Proposes a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to resolve ambiguities in dialogue discourse parsing, outperforming SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers.

Method: A Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) with clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning, and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO).

Result: The approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on the STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on the STAC and Molweni datasets.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

TL;DR: CKD-EHR uses knowledge distillation to improve disease prediction accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models have insufficient medical knowledge representation and low clinical deployment efficiency.

Method: Knowledge distillation from a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B teacher model to a lightweight BERT student model, using multi-granularity attention distillation.

Result: On MIMIC-III, CKD-EHR improves diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR significantly outperforms baseline models in disease risk prediction, enhancing accuracy, timeliness, and resource utilization efficiency.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework for open-domain dialogue generation that enhances response diversity and quality by modeling the one-to-many property of dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: modeling the o2m property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so

Method: modeling the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS)

Result: applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Conclusion: Applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: reducing token fertility without compromising model performance.

Method: rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm

Result: increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information.

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mamba models exhibit primacy and recency effects due to sparse channel encoding, delta-modulated recurrence and semantic regularity modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects.

Method: The study uses structured recall tasks on Mamba architecture and analyzes accuracy profiles, supported by ablations and input perturbations on 1.4B and 7B parameter models.

Result: Observed a U-shaped accuracy profile in Mamba models, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. Identified three mechanisms: sparse channel encoding for long-term memory and primacy, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory and recency, and semantic regularity modulation of memory allocation.

Conclusion: The study identifies three mechanisms (sparse channel encoding, delta-modulated recurrence, and semantic regularity modulation) that explain primacy and recency effects in Mamba models.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are used to classify text related to Sustainable Development Goals. Smaller models can perform as well as larger ones with prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking progress on the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is difficult due to the scale and complexity of data. Text classification models and LLMs can automate the analysis.

Method: Evaluated various LLMs (proprietary and open-source) using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning for single-label, multi-class text classification focused on SDGs.

Result: Smaller, prompt-engineered models perform comparably to larger models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT).

Conclusion: Smaller models with prompt engineering can match larger models like GPT in SDG text classification.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning leverages abstract reasoning prototypes to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving performance gains across various reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The underlying mechanisms supporting cross-domain generalization in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) remain poorly understood. The paper hypothesizes that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains.

Method: ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning). ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness.

Result: ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations.

Conclusion: ProtoReasoning achieves performance improvements on logical reasoning, planning tasks, general reasoning, and mathematics by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is proposed to address the challenges in open-ended QA evaluation by distinguishing question types and applying different ranking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics struggle to capture semantic similarities, current LLM-based evaluation approaches lack intuitive interpretability, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions.

Method: MinosEval distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy.

Result: Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

Conclusion: MinosEval, a novel evaluation method, better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish, especially in Basque's Western dialect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties.

Method: Use NLI as a pivot task and introduce a novel parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish variants.

Result: LLMs show a performance drop when handling linguistic variation; encoder-only models struggle with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation causes performance drop in NLI tasks, especially in Basque.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: Graph RAG framework enhances historical text analysis by improving relation extraction, reducing hallucinations, and offering a low-resource solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General large language models have domain knowledge gaps in historical text analysis, hindering computational humanities and AIGC technology applications.  Manual annotation for historical knowledge extraction is labor-intensive.

Method: The Graph RAG framework combines chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a character relationship dataset. It also introduces a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: The domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieves an F1 score of 0.68 in relation extraction. GraphRAG improves the DeepSeek model's F1 score by 11% on the C-CLUE dataset, surpassing Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B's F1 score and reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The Graph RAG framework, particularly when combined with domain-specific models like Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, significantly improves relation extraction performance in historical texts, reduces hallucinations, and offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new de-identification framework for Korean court judgments, featuring a dataset, PII categorization, and a DNN pipeline that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current de-identification process in the South Korean judiciary is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale, and legal definitions of personal identifiers are vague.

Method: The paper introduces Thunder-DeID, a DNN-based de-identification pipeline, along with a systematic categorization of PII.

Result: The paper constructs and releases the first Korean legal dataset with annotated judgments and entity mentions.

Conclusion: The paper's model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adoption of LLMs in clinical trial recruitment is limited despite their potential for knowledge aggregation and reasoning. Classical approaches are trial-specific, while LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Survey and critical analysis of existing benchmarks, approaches, and evaluation frameworks.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: This survey analyzes trial-patient matching, contextualizes emerging LLM-based approaches, examines benchmarks and evaluation frameworks, and discusses challenges and future directions for LLM adoption in clinical research.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Result: The approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The proposed supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn

extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns in LLMs used in clinical decision support.

Method: DeVisE: a behavioral testing framework with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic and vital sign attributes on a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV.

Result: Zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models are more stable but less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing exposes reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs, informing safer, more transparent medical AI design. Demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing fairness-aware evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding local socio-cultural contexts is crucial for the global effectiveness of Language Models (LMs), especially in diverse countries like India.

Method: A new benchmark dataset, SANSKRITI, comprising 21,853 question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories in India, covering sixteen key attributes of Indian culture.

Result: Evaluation of SANSKRITI on leading LLMs, ILMs, and SLMs shows significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI, a new benchmark, reveals disparities in LLMs' ability to handle culturally nuanced queries related to Indian culture.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states

cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for

TL;DR: COSMMIC: A new dataset for comment-aware multimodal summarization in 9 Indian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for Indian languages remains limited, creating a gap that this study aims to address.

Method: The study explores summarization and headline generation across four configurations: using article text alone, incorporating user comments, utilizing images, and combining all three. It employs state-of-the-art language models and a dedicated comment classifier.

Result: The study assesses the dataset's effectiveness using state-of-the-art language models and evaluates different component combinations to determine the most effective configurations for NLG tasks.

Conclusion: This study introduces COSMMIC, a new comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset for nine major Indian languages, which uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback to advance NLP research and foster inclusivity.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TLI improves cross-lingual lexical alignment in Swahili LLMs by fine-tuning the model using LoRA and a contrastive learning objective, targeting embeddings from an optimal early layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' performance in low-resource languages (LRLs) often lags due to data scarcity. Achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment is crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval.

Method: TLI leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer.

Result: TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for trained and unseen Swahili-English word pairs.

Conclusion: TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of hallucinations in MLLMs used as GUI agents by proposing a new evaluation framework and a training-free technique called Context-Aware Cropping to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability when used as GUI agents.

It also proposes Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context.

Result: The paper's framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a fine-grained evaluation framework and a training-free technique called Context-Aware Cropping to improve the interpretability and robustness of GUI agents.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

*Xinnuo Xu,Rachel Lawrence,Kshitij Dubey,Atharva Pandey,Risa Ueno,Fabian Falck,Aditya V. Nori,Rahul Sharma,Amit Sharma,Javier Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs might be memorizing instead of truly reasoning; RE-IMAGINE tests this by creating tricky problem variations, revealing performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLM reasoning is true reasoning or statistical recall.

Method: RE-IMAGINE framework: automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of a reasoning hierarchy (associations, interventions, counterfactuals) using symbolic representation.

Result: LLM performance decreases on RE-IMAGINE generated problem variations, suggesting reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: LLMs rely on statistical recall for reasoning, as shown by performance drops on problem variations generated by RE-IMAGINE.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CINGS, a post-training supervision method, improves grounding in LLMs by training the model to rely on external context, leading to better performance in both textual and visual domains without sacrificing general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. Prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation.

Method: Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.

Result: In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.

Conclusion: Models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. CINGS induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE is a new framework for efficient and high-quality process annotation that improves reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge.

Method: A novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance when used for fine-tuning models and training reward models, and achieves competitive performance with 2.6 times greater efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARE improves reasoning performance and annotation efficiency.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的情感引导的夸张和隐喻检测框架，并在四个数据集上取得了SoTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法大多关注表面文本特征，忽略了夸张和隐喻的关联以及隐式情感对感知这些修辞手段的影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于双向动态交互的情感引导夸张和隐喻检测框架(EmoBi)。

Result: 情感分析模块深入挖掘夸张和隐喻背后的情感内涵。基于情感的领域映射模块识别目标域和源域，以更深入地理解夸张和隐喻的隐含意义。双向动态交互模块实现了夸张和隐喻之间的相互促进。

Conclusion: EmoBi在四个数据集上优于所有基线方法，在TroFi数据集上的夸张检测F1得分提高了28.1%，在HYPO-L数据集上的隐喻检测F1得分提高了23.1%。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. Reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). Instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available.

Method: We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. Combining instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Combining instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL are valuable for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION, a local attention variant, improves performance and efficiency by capturing out-of-window token information, achieving full-attention performance with a smaller window size and maintaining training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of local attention's disregard for tokens outside the defined window and improve efficiency in short-context regimes.

Method: A variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism to capture information from out-of-window tokens.

Result: RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency at 3B and 12B scales. It matches full-attention performance with a window size of 512 and enhances long-context performance. Training speeds are comparable to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: RATTENTION, with a small window size of 512, matches the performance of full-attention models and enhances long-context performance without compromising training efficiency.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data, leading to the problem of data approximation from model weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus.

Result: On AG News, performance improves from 65% (random data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. On MSMARCO, perplexity reduces from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's 2.0.

Conclusion: A gradient-based approach can recover useful data from model weights, achieving close to original model performance with a small subset of public Web documents.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that reduces latency in LLM-based voice chat applications by generating candidate responses while the user is speaking, achieving a 2x latency reduction with minimal additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) in voice chat applications have noticeable latency due to their size, especially when deployed on consumer-grade hardware, leading to suboptimal user experiences. This latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence.

Method: The paper proposes Predictive Generation (PredGen), a speculative decoding framework at input time to generate candidate responses while the user is still speaking.

Result: Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen) to reduce latency in LLM-based voice chat applications by generating candidate responses while the user is speaking, enabling faster TTS processing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: Previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions.

Method: Introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. Conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Result: Discover significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language

genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal
scientific literature tasks.

*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by a new dataset DiscoSG-DS. They propose DiscoSG-Refiner to address the high inference cost. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance.

Method: DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits

Result: fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WikiMixQA benchmark shows VLLMs struggle with long-context, multi-modal reasoning in documents, especially open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the effectiveness of vision-language large models (VLLMs) in processing long-context vision inputs for automatic document understanding (DU).

Method: Introduced WikiMixQA, a benchmark with 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages, and evaluated 12 vision-language models.

Result: Proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context, but performance drops with retrieval. GPT-4-o exceeds 50% accuracy in long-context retrieval, while open-source models max out at 27%.

Conclusion: Vision-language models struggle with long-context, multi-modal reasoning in document understanding, especially open-source models.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Conclusion: current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones, but issues related to semantic clarity and answerability, and challenges in generating distractors remain

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

### [47] [The Compositional Architecture of Regret in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15617)
*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies regret in LLMs, proposes new metrics and a dataset to analyze it, and identifies key neurons and patterns related to regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the regret mechanism in Large Language Models is crucial for enhancing model reliability and revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.  There is a lack of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons.

Method: The paper proposes a workflow for constructing a regret dataset, the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns.

Result: The paper introduces a new dataset and metrics (S-CDI, RDS, GIC) for analyzing regret in LLMs.  Experiments identified the optimal regret representation layer, revealed an M-shaped decoupling pattern, and categorized neurons into three functional groups.

Conclusion: The paper successfully identifies the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, enhances performance in probe classification, discovers an M-shaped decoupling pattern, and categorizes neurons into regret, non-regret, and dual neurons using the RDS metric.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers stem from different literal meanings and utterance costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors.

Method: Three experiments and a computational cognitive model were used to examine how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers.

Result: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation arise from a combination of different literal meanings and different weights on utterance cost.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs have trouble following instructions to generate sentences with concepts in a specific order, showing they need improvement in instruction-following and compositional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to follow instructions regarding concept order in generative commonsense reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduce Ordered CommonGen benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate sentences with concepts in a specified order.

Result: LLMs often exhibit biases toward specific concept order patterns, leading to low-diversity outputs and failure to achieve high ordered coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to generate sentences with concepts in a specified order, indicating limitations in instruction-following and compositional generalization.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Lightweight character n-gram approaches achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts

evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the

Motivation: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning.

Method: Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions.

Result: CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA).

Conclusion: Cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

TL;DR: Reasoning traces of large reasoning models contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Test-time compute approaches amplify such leakage.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations.

Result: Increased reasoning steps amplify privacy leakage. Increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, but also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking.

Conclusion: Safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

TL;DR: MT systems mostly fail to handle gender ambiguity by producing gender-neutral translations, though some systems show promise using specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity to avoid misgendering and representational harms. Maintaining gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge.

Method: Assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to gender neutrality using three translation directions and categorize observed gender-neutral strategies. Examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on gender-neutral translation.

Result: A disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations is reported, but a few MT systems switch to gender-neutral translation using specific strategies.

Conclusion: MT systems generally fail to produce gender-neutral translations when faced with gender ambiguity, but some systems employ specific strategies to achieve this depending on the target language.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Motivation: Deploying VLMs in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering.

Result: GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Conclusion: GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，诸如错误信息生成和学术不端行为等不良社会问题变得更加严重，使得LLM生成的文本检测现在具有前所未有的重要性。来自私下调整的LLM的文本构成了一个新的挑战，但尚未得到充分探索。用户可以通过使用私有语料库对开源LLM进行微调来轻松拥有私有LLM，导致现有检测器在实践中性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了一种专门用于检测来自未见过的、私下调整的LLM的文本的LLM生成文本检测器PhantomHunter。其family-aware学习框架捕捉了基础模型及其衍生物之间共享的家族级特征，而不是记忆个体特征。

Result: 在来自LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族的数据上的实验表明，PhantomHunter优于7个基线和3个工业服务。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter在检测来自未见过的、私下调整的LLM的文本方面表现出色，F1得分超过96%。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Motivation: Clinical decision-making is complex, influenced by biases and incomplete information. LLMs can support this, but typical usage overlooks real-world complexities.

Method: A hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, is proposed, featuring multi-step, interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs.

Result: Simulated physician-LLM interactions show potential for open-source LLMs as physician assistants.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs hold promise as physician assistants, but require validation with real physician interactions.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, but practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints.

Method: Introduction of a two-dimensional extension of the parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that adds a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths.

Result: 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing and yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT.

Conclusion: The 2D-PT algorithm improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. It achieves near-ideal mixing with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t) and yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical discovery by transforming weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers using small, high-effect-size subpopulations.

Method: NetraAI framework combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms with an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer.

Result: NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations in case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer) that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features.

Conclusion: NetraAI, combining dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, offers adaptive, self-reflective AI for clinical discovery by prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge and uncovering high-effect-size subpopulations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

### [60] [Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14784)
*Emre Yilmaz,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transfer learning method is proposed to predict onflow parameters using surface pressure data.  It works well for adapting to changing data distributions and new tasks, but not so much with noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining onflow parameters is crucial for wind tunnel testing, regular flight, and wind turbine operations. Traditional direct measurements can be challenging due to sensor faults. A data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used, but it needs to achieve close to real-time learning and adapt to changes in data distribution and new prediction tasks.

Method: A transfer learning methodology is proposed to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It involves training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline, freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and then retraining these layers.

Result: The approach is demonstrated using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil, showing successful adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update. The application for noisy data is not as effective.

Conclusion: The transfer learning approach shows potential for adapting to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update. However, it is not as effective for noisy data.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIPE, a physics-informed positional encoding method for vision language models, which improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy by preserving both the physical information and sequential order information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves.

Method: We propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs).

Result: PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works.

Conclusion: PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

*Funing Li,Yuan Tian,Ruben Noortwyck,Jifeng Zhou,Liming Kuang,Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning framework using GNNs and Transformers to optimize retrieval operations in multi-deep storage systems, minimizing tardiness and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density, and multi-deep AVS/RS face challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning-based framework is proposed, featuring a graph-based state representation and a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms heuristic methods in optimizing retrieval tardiness and can be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts due to the Transformer's strong generalization capability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with heuristic methods.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of publicly available, detailed T1D patient data limits progress in personalized therapy, digital twins, and glucose prediction.

Method: Collection of CGM, insulin pump, carbohydrate intake, and device mode data from 25 T1D individuals on AID systems over 6-8 weeks.

Result: Creation of AZT1D, a dataset with granular bolus insulin delivery details from 25 T1D individuals.

Conclusion: AZT1D dataset supports AI and ML applications for improved T1D clinical decision making and individualized care.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [64] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) to retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, which enhances the prediction results in online forecasting with recurring concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift is one of the most prevalent types of concept drift in time series. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms.

Method: The Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. The method selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters.

Result: Experiments on different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

Conclusion: CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts and significantly enhances the prediction results in online forecasting with recurring concepts.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dropout at inference improves PLM zero-shot performance on proteins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs like ESM2 can predict protein properties, but their zero-shot performance can be improved.

Method: Injected a dropout layer between the PLM's featurizer and transformer at inference time and averaged the output.

Result: Dropout of 0.1 at inference improves zero-shot performance on a subset of ProteinGym without retraining.

Conclusion: Applying dropout at inference time to PLMs improves zero-shot performance on ProteinGym, even without dropout training.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AoE creates efficient child models from MoE parents via weight interpolation. Chimera, a DeepSeek hybrid, balances intelligence and speed without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost (10^13-10^15 FLOPs) for pretraining LLM weights motivates a more efficient method to leverage existing Mixture-of-Experts models.

Method: Assembly-of-Experts (AoE) method for linear-time creation of child models via weight interpolation of parent Mixture-of-Experts models.

Result: The AoE method generates functional child models, and the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera" model demonstrates the effectiveness of the method by combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 models to achieve a balance of intelligence and efficiency.

Conclusion: The Chimera model, a hybrid of DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1, achieves R1-level intelligence with 40% fewer output tokens than V3, exhibiting compact reasoning without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

TL;DR: This paper studies the trade-off between generalization and identification in intelligent systems, and finds a fundamental limit on this trade-off. The authors confirm that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective -- to preserve input identity. The paper exposes a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.

Method: The authors derive closed-form expressions that pin the probability of correct generalization and identification to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. They extend the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to n>2 inputs and use a minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end to reproduce these laws.

Result: The paper predicts a sharp 1/n collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for p_S. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws. The same limits persist in a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Conclusion: This paper provides an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarifies how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful

Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between discrete dynamics and continuous time approximations in gradient-based optimization methods, particularly for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, by addressing the discretization error.

Method: The paper designs a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation with counter terms to account for the discretization error.

Result: The paper establishes a continuous time approximation for the discrete Heavy-Ball momentum method with explicit discretization error. It also finds a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigates the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a continuous time model for the Heavy-Ball momentum method that allows control of discretization error to an arbitrary order of the step size. It also uses this model to find a new implicit regularization of directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. Prompt sensitivity is linked to training data.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2

Method: A Model-Router framework dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model for each product based on its demand pattern, using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers.

Result: The deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time.

Conclusion: The Model-Router framework with a deep learning router improves forecasting accuracy and inference time, leading to better inventory management.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models is a complex process, making it prone to
silent errors that are challenging to detect and diagnose. This paper presents
TRAINCHECK, a framework that takes a proactive checking approach to address
silent training errors. TRAINCHECK automatically infers invariants tailored for
DL training. It uses these invariants to proactively detect silent errors
during the training process while providing debugging help. To evaluate
TRAINCHECK, we reproduce 20 real-world silent training errors with diverse root
causes. TRAINCHECK successfully detects 18 errors within a single training
iteration. It also uncovers 6 unknown bugs in popular training libraries that
lead to silent errors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a p-Laplacian model for predicting body composition variables from 3D optical images, offering a cost-effective alternative to DXA scans, especially in data-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases. DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. Most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data.

Method: Applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers obtained from 3D optical images, implemented a semi-supervised model, the  p-Laplacian regression model.

Result: p-Laplacian model yielded errors of ~13% for ALM, ~10% for BMD, and ~20% for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. SVR performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of ~ 8% for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with ~11% error when trained on 80 percent of the data.

Conclusion: The p-Laplacian model is a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited.

Method: The paper trains smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom.

Result: The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples.

Conclusion: The paper's method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks compared to similarly-sized baseline models.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale

such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training

similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

*Yao Zhang,Hewei Gao,Haokun Chen,Weiguo Li,Yunpu Ma,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano is a new federated learning framework for multimodal large language models that reduces client-side storage and communication costs by centralizing the LLM and using lightweight adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges of deploying MLLMs in real-world scenarios with distributed data and privacy constraints, where existing FL methods are inadequate due to the size and communication demands of MLLMs.

Method: The paper introduces FedNano, a novel FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server and employs NanoEdge, a lightweight client-specific adaptation module with modality-specific encoders, connectors, and low-rank adaptation-based NanoAdapters.

Result: FedNano achieves a 95% reduction in client-side storage and limits communication overhead to 0.01% of the model parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines.

Conclusion: FedNano outperforms existing Federated Learning (FL) methods, effectively addressing the challenges of deploying large-scale Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in decentralized, privacy-preserving settings.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper compares surrogate models for HEA property prediction, finding that DGP with machine learning priors excels in handling complex data and inter-property correlations, enabling robust materials design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate modeling is crucial for accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental data.

Method: Comparison of conventional Gaussian Processes (cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost on a hybrid experimental/computational dataset for the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system.

Result: DGP infused with machine learning-based priors exhibit superior performance in predicting correlated material properties and capturing input-dependent uncertainty.

Conclusion: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) with machine learning priors outperform other surrogate models in capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty for HEA material property prediction.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a BiGRU-MHA model for SSD health prediction, achieving high accuracy and generalization, enabling early failure warnings and optimized maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate SSD health state prediction is critical for data reliability assurance, and traditional models face generalization bottlenecks.

Method: A hybrid BiGRU-MHA model incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to capture temporal dependencies and focus on critical health indicators.

Result: The model achieves 92.70% accuracy on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with an AUC of 0.94, demonstrating robust binary classification performance.

Conclusion: The proposed BiGRU-MHA model achieves high accuracy and generalization ability in SSD health state prediction, offering a practical method for preventive maintenance and reducing data loss risks.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of AMD is crucial, but healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, hindering ML model performance. There is a need for classification approaches that consider various factors and offer explainability.

Method: The paper introduces CACTUS, a tool for improving AMD stage classification.

Result: CACTUS outperforms standard ML models in AMD stage classification, enhances decision-making by identifying key factors, provides confidence in its results, and facilitates comparison with existing medical knowledge and bias correction.

Conclusion: CACTUS improves AMD stage classification with explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. It allows comparison with existing medical knowledge and facilitates bias correction.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Motivation: 研究具有一些负样本的小规模单类分类问题

Method: 提出了一种使用负样本的广义参考核(GRKneg)用于One-class SVM (OC-SVM)

Result: GRKneg优于使用径向基函数核的标准OC-SVM。当有大量负样本时，二分类SVM优于单类方法，但在负样本数量最少的情况下，GRKneg明显优于二分类SVM。

Conclusion: GRKneg在负样本数量较少时优于二分类SVM和标准OC-SVM

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an event-driven online VFL framework with dynamic local regret to address challenges of asynchronous data and non-stationary environments, achieving improved stability and reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating online learning into VFL is challenging due to non-intersecting feature sets and asynchronous data arrival across clients in real-world scenarios where data is generated by events relevant to subsets of clients.

Method: An event-driven online VFL framework incorporating dynamic local regret (DLR).

Result: The proposed framework is more stable under non-stationary data and reduces communication/computation costs. A comprehensive regret analysis was conducted.

Conclusion: The proposed event-driven online VFL framework is more stable and reduces communication/computation costs compared to existing online VFL.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedOne, a query-efficient federated learning method for black-box prompt tuning of cloud-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with cloud-based LLM services.

Method: The paper theoretically analyzes query efficiency in federated black-box prompt tuning and proposes the FedOne framework.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in query efficiency using the FedOne framework.

Conclusion: The paper proposes the FedOne framework for federated black-box discrete prompt learning, which maximizes query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

TL;DR: Loss landscapes have channels leading to gated linear units, revealing computational capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure of loss landscapes in neural networks, specifically minima, saddle points, and flat regions.

Method: Characterization of channels to infinity using gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation.

Result: Identification of channels where loss decreases slowly, output weights diverge, and input weights become equal, leading to gated linear units.

Conclusion: Channels in loss landscapes lead to gated linear units, revealing computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Guru, a new RL reasoning corpus, and uses it to train Guru-7B and Guru-32B models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on general reasoning tasks. The study also reveals that RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in domains with limited pretraining exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains, each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering.

Result: The paper finds that domains frequently seen during pretraining easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains.

Conclusion: This paper introduces Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data. The models outperform best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on a 17-task evaluation suite and improve Pass@k performance, especially on complex tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

TL;DR: The paper introduces ODD, a new method that improves error estimation in ML models by focusing on disagreement in the non-overlapping regions of target domains, leading to better performance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable error estimation is crucial for safe ML systems, but existing methods like DIS^2 face challenges due to competition in overlapping source and target domains.

Method: Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) using domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap.

Result: ODD reduces performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) improves target performance prediction by focusing on non-overlapping target domain disagreement.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone, demonstrating the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data, enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week

our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

*Tianyi Xu,Jiaxin Liu,Zizhan Zheng*

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-agent multi-armed bandit framework with a novel probing framework to ensure fair outcomes and maximize system performance. Achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework.

Method: A novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation; a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound in the offline setting; an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness in the online setting.

Result: The algorithm achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

### [89] [Stable CDE Autoencoders with Acuity Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Sepsis Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15019)
*Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDE state representation can achieve strong RL policies when training stability and enforcing acuity-aware representations are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. The critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked.

Method: CDE state representation with training stability and acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores

Result: Stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0).

Conclusion: Stable CDEs produce representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance. Unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

TL;DR: SFT-GO improves LLM fine-tuning by grouping tokens based on importance and emphasizing challenging groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance.

Method: SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss.

Result: Models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: SFT-GO consistently outperforms baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

### [91] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically analyzes the impact of large vocabulary sizes on LLM training, identifies a new training regime (LV), and proposes a new learning rate scaling rule (embedding LR scales with sqrt(width)) that improves training efficiency, especially when vocabulary size is large..


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the conflicting observations regarding the applicability of μP to large language models, particularly the limitation of assuming a fixed input dimension (vocabulary size) when it is often much larger than the model width in practice.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis to study the impact of vocabulary size on training dynamics and derives new scaling rules for the embedding LR. It also includes experiments to validate the theory and pretrains a 1B model to demonstrate the benefits of the suggested scaling rule.

Result: The paper identifies a Large Vocab (LV) regime with distinct optimal scaling rules compared to μP. It finds that the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio scales as Θ(sqrt(width)) in the LV regime, which is validated through experiments and the pretraining of a 1B model.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics in large language models, revealing a Large Vocab (LV) regime where optimal scaling rules differ from those predicted by μP. The analysis suggests an optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio that scales as Θ(sqrt(width)) in the LV regime.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Motivation: Conventional reinforcement learning approaches for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs.

Method: The paper proposes Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass.

Result: Models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. The method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$.

Conclusion: The proposed SPG method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online

methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\\\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers.

Result: Show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm.

Conclusion: Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: HiPreNets: A progressive framework for training high-precision neural networks by sequentially learning prediction residuals, addressing the limitations of traditional MSE-focused methods and improving L-infinity error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training highly accurate deep learning models for complex problems is challenging due to non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters. Traditional approaches often overlook L-infinity error, which is critical in many applications.

Method: The paper refines a staged training technique for neural networks, sequentially learning prediction residuals using additional networks to improve accuracy. It also discusses how to use the structure of residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters, and adaptive data sampling techniques.

Result: The proposed progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets) improves overall accuracy by sequentially learning prediction residuals.

Conclusion: The paper validates the effectiveness of the HiPreNets framework through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs in embodied agents hallucinate, causing errors. A study shows they struggle with scene-task inconsistencies, suggesting limitations in handling infeasible tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents can lead to navigation errors.

Method: Systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents using a hallucination probing set.

Result: Hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Models exhibit reasoning but fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies.

Conclusion: LLMs fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies, revealing limitations in handling infeasible tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Motivation: 现代智能交通系统依靠精确的时空交通分析来优化城市交通和基础设施弹性。然而，传感器故障和异构传感间隙导致普遍存在的数据缺失从根本上阻碍了可靠的交通建模。

Method: 神经规范Polyadic分解(NCPF)模型将低秩张量代数与深度表示学习结合起来，用于鲁棒的交通数据插补。

Result: 通过将CP分解的可解释因子分析与神经网络的非线性表达能力相结合，NCPF为高维交通数据插补提供了一种有原则但灵活的方法，为下一代交通数字孪生和自适应交通控制系统提供关键支持。

Conclusion: NCPF在六个城市交通数据集上优于六个最先进的基线。

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed, given the growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance.

Method: This paper proposes a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. The paper examines representative methods within each category and analyzes their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations.

Result: This paper presents a structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods.

Conclusion: This paper identifies open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) is important, but existing methods degrade model accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a decentralized DML framework, ImprovDML, that uses resilient vector consensus algorithms for Byzantine-resilient aggregation and introduces multivariate Gaussian noises to gradients for privacy preservation.

Result: The paper provides convergence guarantees, derives tighter asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, and demonstrates an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy using concentrated geo-privacy.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates through numerical simulations that ImprovDML achieves high model accuracy while ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks, validating the theoretical results.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify the process of animal behavior by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions.

Method: Skill-based imitation learning (SKIL), a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that infers interpretable skill sets by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills.

Result: The method identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models across a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new method, SKIL, that uses reinforcement learning and representation learning to understand and model animal behavior as a dynamic combination of fundamental motor primitives. It outperforms traditional discrete models in identifying reusable skill components and generating realistic trajectories.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuals can be deceiving, and for scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial.

Method: Quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation.  Proving generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.

Result: The function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. Analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators.

Conclusion: Generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors.  Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

TL;DR: SoKA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses Kronecker-product tensor factorization and SVD to reduce trainable parameters and improve convergence compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of large pre-trained Transformer models is expensive. Existing PEFT methods have limitations like inference-time latency, suboptimal convergence, or fixed rank choices.

Method: The paper proposes SoKA, a PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection.

Result: SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning, formal mathematics, and code generation.

Conclusion: SoKA requires fewer trainable parameters than LoRA/PiSSA while matching or exceeding baseline performance. It also exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

*Mélanie Cambus,Darya Melnyk,Tijana Milentijević,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the robustness of federated learning against Byzantine attacks, providing theoretical bounds and a new algorithm for centroid approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the robustness of federated learning to Byzantine behavior, particularly focusing on the tradeoff between averaging/centroid and validity conditions.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis to derive lower and upper bounds on centroid approximation. It also introduces a new algorithm and provides empirical evaluations in federated learning settings.

Result: The paper establishes a lower bound of min{(n-t)/t, sqrt(d)} on the centroid approximation under box validity and an upper bound of 2min{n, sqrt(d)}. It also presents a new algorithm that achieves a sqrt(2d)-approximation under convex validity.

Conclusion: This paper analyzes the robustness of federated learning to Byzantine behavior, establishing lower and upper bounds on centroid approximation under different validity conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

*Bihe Zhao,Pratyush Maini,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for generating synthetic held-out datasets to improve Dataset Inference, allowing copyright owners to detect unauthorized data usage in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Dataset Inference (DI) methods are limited by the requirement of a private, in-distribution held-out set, which is rarely available in practice.

Method: A data generator trained on a suffix-based completion task is used to create synthetic data, and post-hoc calibration bridges likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data.

Result: Experiments on text datasets demonstrate that the generated data enables DI to detect original training sets with high confidence and a low false positive rate.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel approach to Dataset Inference (DI) by synthetically generating held-out datasets, enabling effective detection of unauthorized data usage in LLM training.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

*Chuan Li,Shunyu Zhao,Vincent Gauthier,Hassine Moungla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DOVA-PATBM, a new framework for optimizing EV charging infrastructure deployment, and demonstrates its effectiveness in Georgia, USA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.

Method: DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.

Result: Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs.

Conclusion: A tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new AI-powered credit risk management system for cross-border e-commerce SMEs, improving their access to financing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financing is a critical challenge for SMEs in cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) due to limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) offers a solution, but requires advanced credit risk management.

Method: The study uses Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) integrated with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) to model sales distributions and estimate risk measures.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the model's efficacy for credit risk assessment and loan size determination.

Conclusion: This study introduces a novel credit risk management framework for 3PL-led SCF in CBEC, demonstrating the effectiveness of QRGMM integrated with DeepFM for credit risk assessment and loan size determination, paving the way for improved SME financing.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Conclusion: SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

TL;DR: Developed a structured active learning paradigm to efficiently design molecules effective against multiple targets, demonstrated on coronavirus proteases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets is challenging due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints.

Method: The method integrates a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops, balancing chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. It alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions and progressively constraining molecules based on multi-target docking thresholds.

Result: The approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates, demonstrating that strategic placement of chemical filters enhances exploration of beneficial chemical space.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a structured active learning (AL) paradigm for optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating pan-inhibitor candidates for three related coronavirus main proteases.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how transformers handle missing labels in in-context learning, finding that deeper/looped transformers can leverage unlabeled data, and proposes looping tabular foundation models to improve semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels.

Method: Theoretical study of one-layer linear attention models and multilayer/looped transformers in a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) setting.

Result: One-layer linear attention models fail to exploit unlabeled data, while multilayer/looped transformers can leverage it. The leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. Looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance.

Conclusion: Multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators, and looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models enhances their semi-supervision capabilities.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: A new method uses embeddings to predict missing clinical lab values, improving prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on performed tests can enable early diagnosis.

Method: A set translation problem is formulated using GPT-like embeddings to handle missing values in tabular data.

Result: Up to 8% AUC improvement for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Conclusion: The method achieves improved AUC scores for predicting abnormal clinical lab values.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

TL;DR: A new knowledge distillation framework uses a non-fine-tuned NNP to train student NNPs, reducing DFT calculation costs by 10x while maintaining accuracy for MD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional knowledge distillation methods in material-specific models increase energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures, which are crucial for stable MD simulations.

Method: A two-stage training process is employed: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset.

Result: The proposed framework reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L10GeP2S12) materials.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework using a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher to generate training data for student NNPs, which are then fine-tuned with DFT data. This approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties while significantly reducing the number of expensive DFT calculations.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schr"odinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework for acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), addressing limitations of diffusion models and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) have limitations in iterative sampling and incorporating approximate velocity models.

Method: Employs a Schr"odinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models and extends the concept of Image-to-Image Schr"odinger Bridge ($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling.

Result: The proposed solution outperforms a reimplementation of conditional diffusion model and achieves superior sample fidelity compared to a supervised learning-based approach with fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs).

Conclusion: The proposed conditional Image-to-Image Schr"odinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework outperforms conditional diffusion model and supervised learning-based approach in reconstructing the reference velocity model.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Motivation: Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity).

Method: Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM)

Result: PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present.

Conclusion: PRISM produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

TL;DR: This paper improves differential privacy auditing in black-box settings using quantile regression for membership inference, achieving tighter bounds with good efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box differential privacy auditing methods have a large gap between empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds, motivating the need for improvement.

Method: Incorporating stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) using quantile regression to improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting.

Result: The proposed approach achieves tighter bounds on differential privacy while maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods, evaluated on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves differential privacy auditing in the black-box setting by using quantile regression for membership inference attacks, achieving tighter bounds while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to safety breaches through fine-tuning. LoX, a training-free method, improves safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace, leading to significant reductions in attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligned LLMs can have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning, even with benign data. This vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning.

Method: The paper proposes Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), a training-free method to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM.

Result: LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. The success of LoX is attributed to moving LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces LoX, a training-free method that enhances the safety robustness of LLMs by extrapolating the safety subspace. Experiments show LoX significantly improves robustness against fine-tuning attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

TL;DR: DiTMC adapts Diffusion Transformers for molecular conformer generation, achieving state-of-the-art results by addressing challenges in integrating graph information, handling symmetries, and generalizing across varying molecular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures.

Method: Adapts DiTs to address challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity; introduces two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies; combines these with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations.

Result: Architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL).

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and

### [116] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)
*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule is introduced to automatically extract rules from preference feedback and formulate them into rule-based rewards, improving RLHF without manual rule engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rule-based rewards approaches for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often rely on manual rule engineering.

Method: AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization.

Result: The extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference, demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes, and capture unique qualities valued in different datasets.

Conclusion: Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6% relative improvement and a 6.1% relative gain compared to a GRPO baseline.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

### [117] [Global Ground Metric Learning with Applications to scRNA data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15383)
*Damin Kühn,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new way to learn the distance function used in optimal transport, which improves performance in several tasks by using only high-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predefined metrics in optimal transport cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports.

Method: The paper proposes a method for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space, providing a distance between individual points like a global metric but requiring only class labels on a distribution-level for training.

Result: The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering, and classification tasks. The effectiveness and interpretability of the approach are demonstrated using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel approach to learn ground metrics for optimal transport, requiring only class labels on a distribution-level for training, and demonstrates its effectiveness in embedding, clustering, and classification tasks using scRNA-seq data.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive framework (VXAI) for evaluating XAI explanations, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation protocols in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics in Explainable AI (XAI) hinders the trustworthiness and usefulness of explanations.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, identifying 362 relevant publications and aggregating their contributions into 41 metric groups. They also propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme.

Result: The paper identifies 362 relevant publications, aggregates their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups, and proposes a three-dimensional categorization scheme for XAI evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a unified framework (VXAI) for evaluating XAI explanations, providing a structured overview of existing metrics and a categorization scheme to support metric selection and comparison.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

*Riccardo De Santi,Marin Vlastelica,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Zebang Shen,Niao He,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new way to explore using diffusion models by maximizing entropy, fine-tuning the model, and showing it works well in generating new things, like images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of exploration in decision-making problems like scientific discovery, where generating novel designs is crucial, without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification.

Method: The method involves casting exploration as entropy maximization, leveraging the connection between a diffusion model's density and its score function, and using a mirror descent algorithm for sequential fine-tuning.

Result: The paper demonstrates promising empirical results on both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion tasks.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel exploration framework based on entropy maximization over the data manifold defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. The algorithm, based on mirror descent, is proven to converge and shows promising results on synthetic and text-to-image diffusion tasks.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

### [120] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dense latents in SAEs are meaningful, functional, and not just noise; they represent different aspects of language model computation across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many SAE latents activate frequently, raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure.

Method: Systematic investigation of the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents, including demonstrating antipodal pairs, ablating their subspace, introducing a taxonomy, and analyzing feature evolution across layers.

Result: Dense latents form antipodal pairs, reconstruct specific directions, and are intrinsic to the residual space. They are tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Feature evolution shifts from structural to semantic to output-oriented across layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are not undesirable artifacts but reflect meaningful model representations and serve functional roles in language model computation.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

TL;DR: This survey reviews reward modeling techniques in deep RL, categorizing approaches and discussing applications, evaluation, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions.  Significant attention has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization.

Result: The survey discusses various applications of reward modeling techniques and reviews methods for evaluating reward models. It also highlights promising research directions in reward modeling.

Conclusion: This survey provides a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature, encompassing both established and emerging methods.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the problem of minimizing disease extinction time in the SIS model on unknown graphs by learning the graph structure and developing effective vaccination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of optimal vaccination in the SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown, a limitation of previous works.

Method: The approach involves a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm for graph recovery and an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem, along with a polynomial-time greedy heuristic.

Result: The paper establishes the sample complexity for graph recovery and proves that the running time of the optimal SRM algorithm is polynomial for graphs with bounded treewidth. Numerical validation of the learning and vaccination algorithms is also provided.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel approach to minimize the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by the SIS model on unknown graphs, validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memory helps zero-shot RL in partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the performance degradation of zero-shot RL methods under partial observability.

Method: Memory-based zero-shot RL methods.

Result: Improved performance over memory-free baselines in domains with partially observed states, rewards, and dynamics.

Conclusion: Memory-based architectures improve zero-shot RL performance under partial observability.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

*Simiao Lin,Wannes Meert,Pieter Robberechts,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for comparing time series that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify, and visualize key transformations, enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences, making it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another.

Method: The paper proposes a novel technique that simplifies the warping path.

Result: The method enhances interpretability in time series comparison by offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel technique for simplifying the warping path to highlight, quantify, and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude) between time series.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

### [125] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RHO, a robust homophily learning method, to address the issue that normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world graph anomaly detection datasets. RHO adaptively learns homophily patterns using adaptive frequency response filters and graph normality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns.

Method: RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views.

Result: Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Conclusion: RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily

attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dimensionality reduction techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels.

Method: The paper uses zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts.

Result: The method enhances cluster separation and transforms dimensionality reduction into an interactive, user-driven process. It bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a user-guided projection framework that enhances cluster separation and transforms dimensionality reduction into an interactive, user-driven process.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Motivation: 线性预测器可以通过添加对应于所有特征对乘积的交互项来建模特征之间的非线性关系。准确估计线性预测器中交互项的系数是一个问题。

Method: 使用低维潜在向量表示每个特征，以此作为一种结构化的正则化方法，以减轻高维设置中的过拟合。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM在模拟和真实数据上，特别是在交互项数量相对于样本数量较高时，实现了比弹性网络和分解机更好的预测精度。LIT-LVM还为特征提供了低维潜在表示，可用于可视化和分析它们的关系。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to make attribution maps for deep learning models more robust to small changes in the input, using randomized smoothing and achieving certified robustness at the pixel level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attribution methods are non-robust, and small input perturbations can drastically alter attribution maps. The paper aims to provide robustness guarantees for pixel-level attribution scores.

Method: The paper uses randomized smoothing to certify pixel-level robustness for black-box attribution methods, reformulating the task as a segmentation problem.

Result: The paper evaluates 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models and shows that certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a certification framework for pixel-level robustness in attribution methods, demonstrating that certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

TL;DR: STGNNs have over-squashing issues, especially with temporal data. Different architectures are equally affected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs have limitations in information propagation (over-squashing), which is unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs). The temporal dimension amplifies this challenge.

Method: Formalized the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and analyzed its characteristics. Proved the impact on different STGNN architectures.

Result: Identified distinct characteristics of spatiotemporal over-squashing compared to the static case. Demonstrated that convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from temporally distant points. Validated findings on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs) suffer from spatiotemporal over-squashing, where information propagation is limited, and convolutional STGNNs favor information from temporally distant points. Time-and-space and time-then-space architectures are equally affected.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePCS is a diagnostic method that detects whether RAG systems meaningfully leverages retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs.

Method: Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions.

Result: On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

Conclusion: RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

### [132] [Learning Algorithms in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15543)
*Hristo Papazov,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores learning computable functions with computational constraints, introducing new observation types. It shows some positive learnability results but also proves limitations regarding characteristic sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints by incorporating computational observations and restricted input sources, addressing the limitations of traditional input-output observations.

Method: The paper extends Gold's inductive inference framework and introduces new types of observations like Time-Bound and Policy-Trajectory Observations. It establishes connections to finite-state transducer inference.

Result: The paper shows that imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations can overcome the learning barrier. It also demonstrates that learning from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions. However, it proves the non-existence of computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets for linear-time computable functions even with policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates both positive and negative results regarding the learnability of computable functions under various computational constraints and observation types, highlighting the limitations of certain characteristic sets.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper simplifies the analysis of SGD on linear regression using linear algebra, making it more accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms. Recent work provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk.

Method: The paper uses simple linear algebra tools to analyze SGD, bypassing the need to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices.

Result: The paper recovers the same bias and variance bounds as previous work using a simplified analysis.

Conclusion: The paper simplifies the analysis of SGD on linear regression, making it more accessible and potentially helpful for further analysis of mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

TL;DR: DAILOC is proposed to address the domain shifts challenge in Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments.

Method: DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.

Result: Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods

Conclusion: DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

*Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogNet是一个基于逻辑门的框架，旨在解释和增强基于DL的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DL框架作为黑盒模型运行，对预测的做出方式或模型如何随着时间的推移对真实世界的噪声做出反应的洞察力有限。这种缺乏可解释性阻碍了我们理解由环境动态引起的时间变化的影响，以及调整模型以实现长期可靠性的能力。

Method: 我们引入了LogNet，这是一种基于逻辑门的新型框架，旨在解释和增强基于DL的室内定位。

Result: LogNet能够通过识别每个参考点（RP）最具影响力的接入点（AP）来实现透明推理，并揭示环境噪声如何扰乱DL驱动的定位决策。

Conclusion: LogNet不仅解释了DL模型的内部行为，而且提高了性能，与之前的基于DL的模型相比，定位误差降低了1.1倍至2.8倍，模型尺寸缩小了3.4倍至43.3倍，延迟降低了1.5倍至3.6倍。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

TL;DR: Scaling deep RL is hard due to gradient issues. Simple fixes can help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly understood.

Method: Empirical analyses and direct interventions to stabilize gradient flow.

Result: Simple interventions enable strong performance even at large scales, validated on various agents and environments.

Conclusion: Gradient pathologies and non-stationarity impede scaling in deep reinforcement learning. Simple interventions can stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance at large scales.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Motivation: To enable compositional reasoning in neural networks for efficient AI.

Method: Ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci is a fast, self-tuning Ricci-flow solver for real-time mesh smoothing using local updates and adaptive neural modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale is challenging due to the cost of global updates in classical Ricci-flow solvers and slow convergence/brittle tuning in greedy heuristics.

Method: A self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver using greedy syndrome-decoding and two neural modules for adaptive vertex and step size selection.

Result: MicroRicci reduces iteration counts by 2.4x, tightens curvature spread, achieves a UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93, adds only 0.25 ms per iteration, and provides an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration.

Conclusion: MicroRicci achieves real-time mesh smoothing with linear-time updates and automatic hyperparameter adaptation, suitable for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE: A memory-efficient DP training method using gradient random projection, achieving similar performance to DP-SGD with less memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like DP-Adam have high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability.

Method: A DP training method with gradient privatization after projection, random Gaussian matrices, and projection during backpropagation.

Result: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. It scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage significantly while maintaining utility comparable to DP-SGD, and scales to large models.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GFLC, a graph-based method for correcting biased labels in ML datasets to improve fairness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The data used to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased and noisy labels, which affects model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.

Method: The paper introduces Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), which combines prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives.

Result: GFLC can correct label noise while preserving demographic parity in datasets.

Conclusion: The paper's experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFLC, showing significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to baselines.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses federated learning to predict brain age in stroke patients, finding it accurate and associated with vascular risk factors and recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.  This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.

Method: We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning.

Result: While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL algorithms often require additional constraints to address distribution shift issues. This paper focuses on the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to poor explorations in suboptimal offline data, a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs).

Method: The paper proposes CAWR, incorporating robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations.

Result: Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that CAWR learns superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR) to address over-conservatism in Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs) due to poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that CAWR learns superior policies and enhances policy optimization performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Conclusion: ViLLa demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

TL;DR: Introduces DAVID-X dataset and DAVID-XR1 model for interpretable AI-generated video detection, providing defect categorization, localization, and natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to reliably distinguish AI-generated video from authentic footage is crucial, but existing methods lack interpretability and persuasive evidence.

Method: A video-language model (DAVID-XR1) is presented, fine-tuned on a new dataset (DAVID-X) with defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales, enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation.

Result: The proposed method achieves strong generalization across various generators and generation modes, transforming AI-generated video detection into a transparent diagnostic process.

Conclusion: Explainable detection methods hold promise for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central

challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally

First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular

*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartIR, an iterative refinement method, improves chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by using structured instructions for visual understanding and iterative refinement for code generation, outperforming existing methods on Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs perform suboptimally on chart-to-code generation, which requires precise visual understanding and accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Direct prompting of MLLMs yields unsatisfactory results.

Method: The paper proposes ChartIR, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. It decomposes the task into visual understanding and code translation, using description and difference instructions for visual understanding, and initial code generation with iterative refinement for code translation.

Result: Experimental results show that ChartIR achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed ChartIR method achieves superior performance on chart-to-code generation compared to other methods, as demonstrated on both Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o models.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains. Prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.

Method: Systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies.

Result: The training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained.

Conclusion: PictSure outperforms existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size determination in CNNs, achieving improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size selection in CNNs is a critical but often overlooked design decision affecting receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy.

Method: The Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF) framework is proposed, integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to balance information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements.

Result: BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1% accuracy improvement and 42.8% reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models. Real-world case studies validate the approach for medical image classification and traffic sign recognition.

Conclusion: BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for efficient CNN designs, suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: A deep learning approach automates retail video annotation, saving time and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video annotation methods are time-consuming and costly.

Method: A deep learning method is used to learn features and incorporate object detection for key-frame identification and annotation.

Result: The approach achieves accuracy comparable to human annotators and leads to 2 times cost savings.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based approach automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotators and significant cost savings.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing methods like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting are computationally expensive.

Method: A novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network (UPNet). UPNet learns a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Aggregates previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to select the most informative viewpoint.

Result: Achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, up to 400x speedup, over 50% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage, and generalizes effectively to novel object categories without additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed AVS method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, significantly reduces computational overhead (up to 400x speedup), and generalizes effectively to novel object categories without additional training.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems.

Method: DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness.

Result: We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR).

Conclusion: PeRL consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by

existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial

address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

### [160] [Frequency-Calibrated Membership Inference Attacks on Medical Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14919)
*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new membership inference attack method, FCRE, is proposed for medical image diffusion models, which focuses on mid-frequency reconstruction errors to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges because reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction.

Method: A Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method is proposed for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. It focuses on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excludes both high-frequency and low-frequency regions. The structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images is computed and compared to a threshold to determine membership.

Result: The FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods on several medical image datasets.

Conclusion: The Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method outperforms existing MIA methods on several medical image datasets.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT models beat CNNs at quark-gluon jet classification by better capturing spatial relationships in calorimeter images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider requires distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have potential but are underexplored for calorimeter image analysis.

Method: Systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data with multi-channel jet-view images.

Result: ViT-based models, like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy.

Conclusion: ViT-based models outperform CNN baselines in quark-gluon jet classification, demonstrating the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

*Ziteng Li,Malte Kuhlmann,Ilana Nisky,Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LRCN and Transformer models to accurately predict object compliance using GelSight, improving upon existing methods and addressing limitations in portability, scalability, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection methods are limited in portability, scalability, and cost, and existing neural network approaches lack sufficient accuracy. This paper aims to address these limitations by proposing more accurate models for compliance prediction using vision-based tactile sensors.

Method: Two models based on LRCNs and Transformer architectures are used to leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the GelSight sensor.

Result: The proposed models show significant performance improvement over the baseline in estimating compliance. The study also found that estimating the compliance of objects harder than the sensor is more challenging.

Conclusion: The proposed LRCN and Transformer models accurately estimate compliance using GelSight sensor data, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

### [163] [Hyper-Local Deformable Transformers for Text Spotting on Historical Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15010)
*Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps, and SynthMap+, a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images for training text spotters. PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of effective methods and training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters have the potential to solve these challenges but remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component in a text instance.

Method: PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. A novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, is presented for training text spotters for historical maps.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text.

Conclusion: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. PALETTE with SynthMap+ has been deployed to process over 60,000 maps and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods and also unifies the framework for different tasks; enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization

Method: a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space; a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback; a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model

Result: achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content; achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Conclusion: achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

TL;DR: Addresses training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization by using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions, leading to better codebook utilization and reduced error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to a mismatch between the distributions of features and code vectors.

Method: Employing Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors.

Result: Achieved near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduced quantization error. Validated through empirical and theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a method using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions, enhancing codebook utilization and reducing quantization error.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: improving the quality of negative prompts to  achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images

Method: design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets.

Result: SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

*Jiaqi Shi,Jin Xiao,Xiaoguang Hu,Boyang Song,Hao Jiang,Tianyou Chen,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) for point cloud analysis that improves performance and robustness by using high-dimensional correlation to correct feature distribution. It outperforms existing methods with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for point cloud analysis using 3D relative coordinates suffer from irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems. Enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have high computational overhead and noise sensitivity.

Method: The paper proposes a Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes correlation in high-dimensional space to correct feature distribution during aggregation. It distinguishes point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor and enhances structural homogeneity through variance reduction and increased class separability. A key point mechanism is introduced to optimize computational overhead.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on semantic segmentation and classification tasks with less parameter cost. Ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the method.

Conclusion: The proposed PDSA module improves performance on semantic segmentation and classification tasks with less parameter cost, as verified by experiments.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, improves left ventricle segmentation in echocardiograms, outperforming existing methods on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate left ventricle (LV) segmentation in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnosis, but ultrasound images are noisy with low contrast and ambiguous boundaries.

Method: A dual-noise diffusion model (Echo-DND) combining Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, a multi-scale fusion conditioning module, and spatial coherence calibration.

Result: The model outperforms existing SOTA models, achieving Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The Echo-DND model sets a new standard in echocardiogram segmentation with high Dice scores, promising broader applications in medical imaging and improved diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis combines image retrieval and visual grounding for large-scale search, offering a new benchmark and metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques either perform well on visual grounding (but assume the object is always present) or text-to-image retrieval (but lack fine-grained localization), but none address both simultaneously for large-scale visual search.

Method: A zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model is used.

Result: The paper establishes a benchmark and metric, and demonstrates the potential for improvement over a zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), a new task unifying corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding, and provides a benchmark and metric for future research.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of highly specialized medical image analysis models, which are limited to predefined tasks and require extensive resources for development and adaptation, while generalist models allow medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly.

Method: The paper trains generalist models using visual in-context learning (VICL) to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a baseline for in-context learning on retinal OCT images, highlighting both the potential and limitations of this approach.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation of publicly posted images by VLP models.

Method: A flexible coding method (PSIC) with a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function, along with an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the design.

Conclusion: The proposed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) scheme effectively protects user privacy by preventing interpretation by VLP models while maintaining satisfactory perceptual quality. It can be integrated into existing LIC models and demonstrates effectiveness across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: DM-FNet, a two-stage diffusion model, addresses limitations in multimodal medical image fusion by enhancing feature capture and cross-modal interaction, leading to improved image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality.

Method: A two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) is proposed, using UNet for image reconstruction and a fusion network with three key modules for adaptive processing of medical images.

Result: Experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed DM-FNet method performs exceptionally well in multimodal medical image fusion, preserving brightness, tracer distribution, textures, and edges.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code
is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Conclusion: The proposed C-AFBiFPN framework substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features on the SSDD dataset.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Motivation: NeRF and 3DGS depend heavily on accurate camera pose priors, and existing approaches fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex.

Method: RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

*Chenxi Zhang,Jiayun Wu,Qing Zhang,Yazhe Zhai,Youwei Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetroMem uses a memory mechanism to improve camouflaged object detection by incorporating historical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes.

Method: The paper proposes a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. It employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage with a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) and a recall stage with a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR).

Result: RetroMem dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process, improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes.

Conclusion: RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on several widely used datasets.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms, improves performance in semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation settings within the semiconductor field.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

TL;DR: MSNeRV, a multi-scale feature fusion framework, is proposed to improve INR-based video compression, achieving better performance than existing methods and VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content due to the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design.

Method: A multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, is proposed, which includes temporal windows for temporal consistency, GoP-level grid for background representation, a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function, and a multi-scale feature block.

Result: MSNeRV exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MSNeRV model demonstrates superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Conclusion: BCRNet significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the L3D and P2ILF datasets.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath is a novel open-set active learning approach for pathology image classification that uses a pre-trained VLM and task-specific prompts to improve sample selection and model performance in environments with OOD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Active Learning (AL) methods for pathology image classification require large-scale annotated datasets and are inefficient in real-world clinical environments with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods also start with random selection, wasting labeling costs in open-set scenarios.

Method: A novel open-set active learning approach leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). It uses task-specific prompts in the first query and Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) in subsequent queries, including Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS).

Result: OpenPath enhances model performance and outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods due to its high purity of selected samples. Experiments were conducted on two public pathology image datasets.

Conclusion: OpenPath significantly enhances model performance due to the high purity of selected samples and outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods on two public pathology image datasets.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDIS is a Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) methods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowledge about natural images.

Method: Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model and Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG).

Result: DDIS generates samples that better reflect the training data distribution.

Conclusion: DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods and achieves SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA

*Anju Chhetri,Jari Korhonen,Prashnna Gyawali,Binod Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents NERO, a neuron-level relevance based method for out-of-distribution detection in medical imaging, improving upon existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliability in deep learning, especially in medical imaging, is paramount, and separating out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a valuable indicator of a model's reliability. Existing OOD detection methods may not fully capture OOD diversity.

Method: The method clusters neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class, introduces a relevance distance metric, incorporates scaled relevance in the bias term, and combines feature norms.

Result: NERO achieves improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the Kvasir and GastroVision gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper introduces NERO, a novel OOD scoring mechanism leveraging neuron-level relevance at the feature layer, and demonstrates its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Conclusion: MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical report generation.

Abstract: Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in

prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted
report generation. Extensive experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets
demonstrate that MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical
report generation. Our code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: achieves state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI

At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns.

TL;DR: RaCalNet achieves superior depth estimation with sparse LiDAR supervision by refining radar measurements, outperforming methods requiring dense supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar requires costly and data-intensive dense LiDAR supervision. RaCalNet aims to eliminate the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors, using these priors as anchors to guide monocular depth prediction.

Result: RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89% on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and in real-world deployment scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: RaCalNet, using sparse LiDAR supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods in depth map generation, showing effectiveness on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Motivation: Existing layout-to-image generation methods face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts.

Method: Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update

Result: WinWinLay enhances control precision and realism in layout-to-image generation.

Conclusion: WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A novel graph-based framework enables scalable AGB estimation from point clouds, reducing pre-processing and improving performance in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees, depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment.

Method: The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error).

Conclusion: This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline for AGB estimation.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Motivation: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality.

Method: propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model

Result: achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously

Conclusion: DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

Motivation: Conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images because the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities.

Method: M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm and GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism.

Result: M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for

*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Zhirui Gao,Jiazhao Zhang,Yihan Cao,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reconstruction-free online 3D object detection framework using Cubify Anything and CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with memory efficiency and real-time capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment.

Method: The method leverages Cubify Anything for single-view 3D object detection, CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics, an association module for multi-view correspondences, and an optimization module using particle filtering for multi-view consistency.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets and enables real-time perception in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Conclusion: The proposed reconstruction-free online framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection among online methods and exhibits great generalization abilities, enabling real-time perception in large environments.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a text-to-HOI diffusion framework that achieves realistic and accurate human-object interactions by optimizing in noise space and separating contact and motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic and plausible HOI is challenging due to strict contact accuracy requirements and diverse motion possibilities, with current methods struggling to balance realism and physical correctness.

Method: Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model, separating the problem into object-centric (contact location) and human-centric (motion refinement) phases.

Result: HOIDiNi demonstrates superior performance in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality on the GRAB dataset, generating complex and controllable interactions from textual prompts.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework, outperforms existing methods in generating realistic and plausible human-object interactions (HOI) by achieving both contact accuracy and motion naturalness.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-term memory in VLMs for embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle to process long-term experience collected across multiple days, limiting their application to real-world robotics. Existing benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation.

Method: The paper introduces a new benchmark and evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on it.

Result: The paper assesses the performance of VLMs on memory-intensive tasks and highlights areas for improvement.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator to evaluate memory-based capabilities. The paper also presents baselines integrating state-of-the-art VLMs with low-level navigation policies.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs' performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. VQ-TTT is introduced to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how input visual quality shapes the responses of MLLMs.

Method: Introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT) to dynamically adjust each input image in a single forward pass.

Result: VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets.

Conclusion: The performance of MLLMs can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. VQ-TTT can improve the accuracy of MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViMaR is a fast and accurate inference-time decoding strategy for VLMs that improves efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time search approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) are computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations.

Method: Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR), a two-stage inference framework that combines a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment.

Result: ViMaR achieves over 4x speedup compared to existing value-guided methods and generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model. When ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4x speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. It also generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model and can be used for self-training to achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

TL;DR: This paper presents a video diffusion model for single-image/video relighting that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs, improving realism and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end relighting models are limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, and two-stage pipelines are susceptible to error accumulation and fail to produce realistic outputs.

Method: A general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models.

Result: The model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a single-pass approach using video diffusion models to jointly estimate albedo and synthesize relit outputs, achieving strong generalization and surpassing previous methods in visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Motivation: Existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training due to limitations in locations, duration, scene dynamics, and annotations.

Method: Develop an efficient toolbox to collect, pre-process, and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories.

Result: Introduce Sekai, a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations, consisting of over 5,000 hours of video from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. Train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME.

Conclusion: Sekai dataset benefits video generation and world exploration, motivating valuable applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: ECAD uses a genetic algorithm to learn efficient caching schedules for diffusion models, achieving significant inference speedups and improved quality-latency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image generation models suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference.

Method: a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier

Result: ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x on PixArt-alpha.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

TL;DR: CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making and require human grounding in multi-modal environments. Neural networks lack interpretable structures for reasoning. CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception.

Method: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module.

Result: CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy in fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%). It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and human preferences.

Conclusion: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments, laying the foundation for next-gen AI systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Result: Introduces MEAL, the first benchmark tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC in a few hours.

Conclusion: Naively combining popular CL and MARL methods fails to scale to complex settings in MEAL, requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

Conclusion: T-PPO improves training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms existing competitors.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

It leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. A dual-reward mechanism is used to fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector.

Result: HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers on canonical benchmarks.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Motivation: Autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).

Method: RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. Evaluates the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO.

Conclusion: MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

*Jiahao You,Ziye Jia,Chao Dong,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cooperative MEC framework with a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic algorithm for computation offloading and resource allocation in maritime environments with uncertain tasks, using Lyapunov optimization to handle unpredictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) and the challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation due to uncertain maritime tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a cooperative MEC framework and a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic algorithm to solve a Markov game formulation of the optimization problem.

Result: The paper leverages Lyapunov optimization to tackle unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability, converting long-term constraints into short-term constraints.

Conclusion: The paper conducts simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation in maritime environments.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance.

Method: Introducing a causal framework and a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that CAN consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Ablation studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN) method outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments due to the Causal Understanding Module.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the operational effectiveness and reliability of the LLM-based Planning Agent (LPA) in supporting Failure Analysis (FA) tasks.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse

### [218] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agent behavior in games depends on how game history is represented in natural language. Summarized history and regret information lead to better equilibrium-matching behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, obscuring the impact of state representation on agents' behavior and limiting comparability between studies.

Method: A unifying framework is presented to systematically construct natural language state representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. The framework characterizes methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style.

Result: Representations providing summarized history, regret information, and limited information about others' actions lead to behavior more closely matching game-theoretic equilibrium predictions, with more stable game play. Other representations exhibit large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

Conclusion: LLM agent behavior is highly dependent on the natural language state representation. Representations with summarized history, regret information, and limited information about others' actions lead to behavior closer to game-theoretic equilibrium.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

TL;DR: Developed and piloted an AI Policy Module 2.0 for CS students, finding it increased their concern about AI ethics and confidence in discussing AI regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems.

Method: Developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation".

Result: The AI Regulation Assignment is an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing ethical challenges.

Conclusion: Students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies and greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation after completing the module.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs overthink, leading to inefficiency. The paper introduces two methods, Efficiency Steering and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, to reduce reasoning length and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often exhibit overthinking, which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost.

Method: Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework

Result: methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance

Conclusion: Reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Motivation: Existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability.

Method: SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Result: SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark.

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is

TL;DR: Embodied Web Agents paradigm and benchmark introduced to bridge the gap between AI's digital reasoning and physical interaction abilities, revealing performance gaps in integrated tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are limited by their separation between digital reasoning and physical interaction, hindering their ability to solve tasks requiring integrated intelligence.

Method: Development of Embodied Web Agents task environments and benchmark, a unified simulation platform integrating 3D environments with web interfaces.

Result: The Embodied Web Agents Benchmark reveals performance gaps, highlighting challenges and opportunities in embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Conclusion: Significant performance gaps exist between current AI and human capabilities in tasks requiring integrated physical and digital intelligence.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.
