A\nmajor obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is\ncatastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired\ncapabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is\nchallenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we\ninvestigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without\ncatastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging\nmemory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by\ndesign. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new\npiece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce\ninterference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities.

While recent advancements have significantly\nimproved the accuracy of multi-table join query estimations, these methods\nintroduce challenges such as higher space overhead, increased latency, and\ngreater complexity, especially when integrated with the binary join framework.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel cardinality estimation method named TKHist,\nwhich addresses these challenges by relaxing the uniformity assumption in\nhistograms. TKHist captures bin-wise non-uniformity information, enabling\naccurate cardinality estimation for join queries without filter predicates.\nFurthermore, we explore the attribute independent assumption, which can lead to\nsignificant over-estimation rather than under-estimation in multi-table join\nqueries. To address this issue, we propose the dominating join path correlation\ndiscovery algorithm to highlight and manage correlations between join keys and\nfilter predicates.

Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design.

The fundamental principle behind these systems is the separation of\ncompute and storage layers. In this architecture, inexpensive cloud storage is\nutilized for data storage, while compute engines are employed to perform\nanalytics on this data in an \"on-demand\" mode. However, to execute any\ncalculations on the data, it must be transferred from the storage layer to the\ncompute layer over the network for each query. This transfer can negatively\nimpact calculation performance and requires significant network bandwidth. In\nthis thesis, we examine various strategies to enhance query performance within\na cloud data lake architecture. We begin by formalizing the problem and\nproposing a straightforward yet robust theoretical framework that clearly\noutlines the associated trade-offs.

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain\nefficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the\never-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained\nusing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate\nflower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial\nstate, and performance feedback from previous episodes.

Managing these embedding sizes can be\nchallenging, leading to bulky models that are harder to deploy and maintain. In\nthis paper, we introduce a method to automatically determine the optimal\nembedding size for ID features, significantly reducing the model size while\nmaintaining performance.\n  Our approach involves defining a custom Keras layer called the dimension mask\nlayer, which sits directly after the embedding lookup. This layer trims the\nembedding vector by allowing only the first N dimensions to pass through. By\ndoing this, we can reduce the input feature dimension by more than half with\nminimal or no loss in model performance metrics. This reduction helps cut down\nthe memory footprint of the model and lowers the risk of overfitting due to\nmulticollinearity.\n  Through offline experiments on public datasets and an online A/B test on a\nreal production dataset, we demonstrate that using a dimension mask layer can\nshrink the effective embedding dimension by 40-50\\%, leading to substantial\nimprovements in memory efficiency.

However, their performance remains constrained by\nlimited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as\ncontext to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically\noperate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information\ndensity and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose\n\\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into\nstructured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement\nlearning, \\textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that\ndynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of\nmulti-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our\napproach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific\nstructures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and\nreliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural\nverification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both\ncorrect and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks show that \\textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive\nperformance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much\nlarger models.

To address these limitations, this study\nproposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining\nmanufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)\nreasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are\ntransformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large\nlanguage model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,\nstates, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that\nrespect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link\nprediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with\nthe target line's process flow.\n  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that\nthe proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),\nachieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification. Ablation\nstudies confirm the contributions of both LLM-driven domain conceptualization\nand process-aware learning.

Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and\ndata during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow\ntrajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based\nmethods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data\npoints, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets\nin FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages\nSemi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by\nestablishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data\npoints with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by\npartitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a\ncorresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired\nwith data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and\nmodel architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental\nresults show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play\ncomponent.

Based on this framework, we construct the first\nlarge-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000\nhigh-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in\nboth algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the\ngenerality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the\ndevelopment of feed-forward 3D editing models.

Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by\ntask-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to\nground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance.

A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is\nthat they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains\nthey were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR\nincorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer\nlayer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of\nadditional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which\nintroduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To\nassess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical\nevaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation\nsetups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot\ngeneralizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different\nunderlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective\ntest sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform\nzero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform\nfurther experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters\n(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this\nvariation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE\nis particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as\nTinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning\nacross benchmarks.

Each generated\nquestion is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling\nreinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart\nreasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen\nquestions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional\nquestions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed\ndata yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS\ninduces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting.

In this paper, we present\nTACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to\naddress these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts\nduring training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL\ndynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual\nsamples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler\ncases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling\nmore complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including\nEnglish and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements\nacross diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission\nprediction and TCM syndrome differentiation.

Surprisingly,\nin the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all\n$\\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be\nachieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative\nanswer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model\nthat, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one\nclustering that is simultaneously $O(\\log^4 n)$-competitive for all\n$\\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\\log n)$-competitive for the\n$\\ell_\\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the\n$\\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline\n\"all-norms\" guarantee to the online world.\n  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a\nfundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order\n(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\\ell_1$-norm is trivially\n$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO\nmodel for the fairness-promoting $\\ell_\\infty$-norm must have a competitive\nratio of at least $\\Omega(n^{1/3})$.

We are the\nfirst to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)\ntask. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural\nhomogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which\nchallenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in\neffectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval\nmechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM\nintroduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates\ndynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from\nspecific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning\nof drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between\nwords and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction\nmodule, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic\nterm to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and\nimprove the robustness of feature representation.

Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal\noperator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from\nthe empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest\nfeq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional\nsubspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse\nstructure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and\nre-normalizing yields a valid PMF.\n  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the\ncomputation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support\ntimes the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a\npractical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an\northogonal-series risk estimate, so the method \"just works\" with minimal\ntuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves\ncoarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to\nlogspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes.

Prior work shows that adding localized text control\nsignals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these\nmethods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,\noffering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between\nindividual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable\nobjects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework\nthat conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text\ndescriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate\nthese signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and\nglobal text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that\nproduces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we\nannotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these\ncomponents enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,\npairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.\nExtensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more\naccurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with\nprior approaches.

In particular, aggregating models' next-token\nprobability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be\neffective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,\nits application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a\ncareful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of\nensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key\nfactors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models\nand consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we\npropose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively\nensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,\nwe introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities\nspread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single\nrepresentative token.

However, most existing evaluations focus on\npassive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete\ninformation. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not\nenough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing\nevidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs\nto actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under\nincomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool\nwithout task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose\nGuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented\nimages for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs\nand find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive\nsettings, indicating substantial room for improvement.

However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning\nin RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are\ninsufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and\ninfinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses\nensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate\nheterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an\nExpectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator\ntypes and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation\nalgorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single\ngenerative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these\ncontributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness\nand personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u5143\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06RLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e8c\u5143\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u30022. \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u504f\u597d\u7eb3\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDPO\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08EM\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528min-max regret\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones.

Together,\nthese components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to\n$424\\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM\nof 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining\nparameter efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveGen3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u800c\u6ca1\u67093D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5355\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "DriveGen3D\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u957f\u671f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aFastDrive-DiT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff1bFastRecon3D\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u6784\u5efa\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "DriveGen3D\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe424x800\uff0c12 FPS\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.811\u7684SSIM\u548c22.84\u7684PSNR\u3002", "conclusion": "DriveGen3D\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

More critically, the characterization of deception\nacross realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically\nevaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,\nwhat their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect\nthem. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150\nmeticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,\nEducation, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,\nproviding sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the\nintrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic\ntendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the\nextrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive\noutputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive\npressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to\nconstruct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.\nExtensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal\ncritical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement\ndynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to\nmanipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards\nagainst various deception behaviors.
