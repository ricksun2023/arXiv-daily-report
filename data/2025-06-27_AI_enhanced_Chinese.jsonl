However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth\ndiffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of\nboth.

A key capability for this process is the ability\nto generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in\nwhich LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert\nideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should\nalso result in better research after being executed. To test whether\nAI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution\nstudy by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,\neither written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100\nhours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the\nexperiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP\nresearchers.

Answering questions over such\ncontent often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains\ntraditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented\ncross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation\nframework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal\nextraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to\na lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both\nstructured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals.

These\nlimitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world\nlanguage tasks.\n  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream\napplications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant\nknowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training\ntechnique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,\nwe present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces\nmemory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also\nintroduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better\nfollow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their\nperformance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.\nFinally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop\nspatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more\ncomprehensively.\n  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results\ndemonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,\nefficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of\napplications.

Building on earlier work, we\ncontend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three\nfundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap\n-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning\ndemands internal representations that support simulation of actions and\nresponse, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and\ncontinuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific\ndiscovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in\ncausal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic\nplanners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge\ngraphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes\ncausal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while\nstrengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations\nthrough closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and\nautomated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides\naction and empirical surprise reshapes understanding.

To explain this phenomenon, we\nconduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that\nexhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural\nsettings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a\nsimple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the\nquantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of\nactivations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \\emph{in situ} intervention\nexperiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be\naverted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these\nfindings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that\ncertain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with\nfull-precision training.

This work addresses a key\nchallenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear\nscale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively\nexpensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure\nmodeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale\nphenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in\nregimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of\ndiffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure\nmodeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical\napplications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this\nlimitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional\ndiffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the\ndimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical\ncharacteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach\nhelps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small\nreconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model\nin the latent space.

In\nthis paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework\ndesigned to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial\nand frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and\nmulti-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to\nbetter capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses\nthe loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a\ncurvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then\nguides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations\nmore effectively.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose \\textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework\nintegrating \\textbf{M}ulti-scale \\textbf{E}quivariant \\textbf{G}raph\n\\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging\nadvanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric\nfeatures with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and\nglobal sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method\nensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust\ngeneralizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the\nSAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\\%\nrise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\\AA\\ reduction in root mean square\ndeviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading\nantibody design model.

In\nthis work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase\nsampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.\nWe seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional\nNormalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these\narchitectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a\nnon-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that\nknowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,\nwe can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance\ngains over a non-distilled student.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations.

After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,\nnon-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18\nbackbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary\nmasks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation.

Yet, a score fails to\ndescribe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.\nBenefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models\n(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.\nThe core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.\nPrevious explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data\ngeneration processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary\nsystems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.\nSpecifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled\nvideo and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a\nhierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific\ndimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning\nprocess.

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift.

Consequently, data collected under perturbed and\nunperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt\nto forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent\nrelationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling.

Although existing\nrobust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value\ndistribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that\nenhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a\nswitching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism\ndynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially\ninduced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first\nderives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range\nof perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a\nmultiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in\nresponse to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving\nadversarial strategies.

These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade\nvalue estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the\nexisting policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through\niterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance\nminimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically\nevaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D\nobstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms\nstandard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative\nreward and over 30% fewer conflict events.

Our proposed policy module is\nadaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.\nExperimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,\nEasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly\nenhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,\nand energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the\nperformance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "EgoAdapt\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e3a\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EgoAdapt\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6267\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6EPIC-Kitchens\uff0cEasyCom\u548cAria Everyday Activities\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c", "conclusion": "EgoAdapt\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe89.09%\u7684GMACs\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe82.02%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u9ad8\u8fbe9.6\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

To preserve\ntwo fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,\ncurrent works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$\nnormalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected\nby the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily\nleads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of\nquery and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after\nbeing mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware\nLinear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and\nrecover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple\nquery and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve\nnorm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We\nmathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the\nquery norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel\nfunction for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure\nnorm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a\nnorm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into\npositive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with\nopposite directions.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN\nperturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as\nbenign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also\nintroduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating\nmodels in understanding complex human intentions and emotions.

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading.

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a\ngrowing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are\nlikely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same\nmodels. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when\nonly fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked\nwith our BitMark.

Typically, training data is generated\nusing point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D\nsensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits\nthe generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,\ndomain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological\ninformation, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the\nsource domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware\nModeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds.

Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with\nmultiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from\neach step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as\n\"it\", \"here\" and \"the same\" to make language expressions concise.

Due to the lack of an\neffective module for collecting related historical information,\nstate-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the\nSG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for\ntemporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding.
