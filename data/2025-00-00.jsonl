Among\nvarious loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are\nparticularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant\nin-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these\nlosses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be\nviewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust\nOptimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)\nRespective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution\ndistance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false\nnegative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which\ngeneralizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.\nDrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be\ndemonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments\nhave been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation\naccuracy and robustness."}

However, modern\nrecommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due\nto the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are\nnon-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.\nLookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new\nitems based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such\nlimitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further\nimprove recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)\nstruggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features\nin modern recommendation systems.\n  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel\nframework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user\nmodeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the\nunidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these\nsequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact\nwith the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix\nprompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of\nNext-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online\nA/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of\n0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin,\nshowcasing its practical applicability and scalability."}

Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting\nmultiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling\nfine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has\ndrawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current\nrecommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation\nmethods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this\nwork, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future\ndirections of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three\nquestions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for\nrecommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in\nrecommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with\nthe technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey\nestablishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for\nresearchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The\nimplementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is\nmaintained at https://github.com/WHUIR/Multi-Interest-Recommendation-A-Survey."}
