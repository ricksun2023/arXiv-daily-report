This paper presents\nan integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for\nprescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to\nprovide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP\nframework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that\ncombines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for\nintelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration\ndata (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM\nprocessing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system\nclassifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and\nassesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance\nmanuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web\nsearches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date\nmaintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The\nGemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes\nimmediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts\nrequirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing\nvibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually\nrelevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between\ncondition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial\npractitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the\napplication of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework\nfor prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial\nsectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u7ef4\u62a4\u9700\u8981\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6545\u969c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u96c6\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f74\u627f\u632f\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff08BPFO\u3001BPFI\u3001BSF\u3001FTF \u9891\u7387\uff09\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf LLM \u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f7f\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u5904\u7406\u7ef4\u62a4\u624b\u518c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u68c0\u7d22\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbf\u95ee\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f74\u627f\u632f\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5185\u5708\u3001\u5916\u5708\u3001\u6eda\u73e0/\u6eda\u67f1\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u67b6\u6545\u969c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u3002Gemini \u6a21\u578b\u7136\u540e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7acb\u5373\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u6e05\u5355\u3001\u7ea0\u6b63\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u96f6\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ece\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u673a\u68b0\u90e8\u4ef6\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5RADAR\u3002", "result": "RADAR\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u5728MVTec-AD\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867%\u548c13%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We introduce\nRCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to\nenable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically\nrelevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while\nadhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory\nselection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory\nstore to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model\nbehavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures\nLLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three\nmulti-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate\nthat RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining\nanswer quality.

Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main\ntypes: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep\nreasoning (e.g., \"what is in the image?\"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,\nwhich concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle\nclues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning.

Existing methods for\nmultimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations\nwithin textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can\nsignificantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits\nvarying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this\nchallenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for\nMultimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.\nPA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal\nattention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings\nwhile maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing\nthe model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz\ncontinuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the\nproposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering\nstrong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated\ninto existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic\nevaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of\ntextual noise.

However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such\nas long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding\nsuicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art\nlanguage models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning\nmodels (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help\npeople annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included\nboth automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our\nproposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of\nextracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant\ncontext. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model\nachieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs.

Recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior\nknowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic\nprompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we\nrigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in\nsilico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference\nperformance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly\ntrained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot\nprompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or\nsuperior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,\nparticularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable\nlimitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including\narithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical\nlogic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,\nmeals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's\nlimitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through\ntextual inference.

In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a\ntest-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses\nthis limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better\nalign with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving\ngeneralization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly\noptimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the\nprimary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme\nto enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the\nprimary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary\ntask on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.\nExtensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models\nand three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to\nthese models improves their performance, yielding superior results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Highlight-TTA, a test-time adaptation framework, dynamically adapts the model during testing to better align with the specific characteristics of each test video, improving generalization and highlight detection performance.", "motivation": "Existing video highlight detection methods struggle to generalize well to all test videos because they fail to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test videos.", "method": "a test-time adaptation framework Highlight-TTA, jointly optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the primary highlight detection task.

Despite being\ntrained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate\nshift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)\nparameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the\ndistribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of\nperspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without\nretraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens\nas a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for\nalignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit\nthat modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and\nloss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical\nreference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not\nrequire fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective\nimage datasets.

To investigate the\nmechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a\nconsistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a\nsequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),\nmodels systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and\nend of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our\nanalysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical\ninformation is key to enhancing model performance.

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we\nintroduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific\nattention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost\nconfidence scores for object proposals.

Our analysis\nprovides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,\nincluding the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as\nwell as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic\nvariant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control\nover the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for\ndownstream layers and nonlinearities.

This learned uncertainty\nserves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian\nopacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty\nundergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically\ntransforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that\ngovern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.\nExtensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that\nour method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher\nquality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to\nexisting sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method\nachieves 3.27\\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u76843DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743Gaussians\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u5bf9Gaussians\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u7b49\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u4eec\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Gaussians\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5b83\u6307\u5bfcGaussian\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u63013DGS\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ecf\u5386\u8f6f\u53ef\u5faedropout\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684dropout\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a7\u5236\u6700\u7ec8\u7684Gaussian\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe3D\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684Gaussians\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4e0eDropGaussian\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MipNeRF 360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.27\uff05\u7684PSNR\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe3D\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684Gaussian\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high\nperformance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its\nexplanations effectively reflect the decision-making process.

We argue that in\nimage compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step\nrefinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained\nVAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the\niterative denoising process with a single-step decoding.

Furthermore, we design the rate annealing\ntraining strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.\nExtensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,\ncompared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves\ndecoding speed by more than 20$\\times$.
