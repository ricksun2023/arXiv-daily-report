  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax Loss (SL) 和 Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) 在优化推荐模型中非常有效，但它们的理论联系和差异值得深入研究。SL对假阴性实例表现出高度敏感性，而CCL存在数据利用率低的问题。

Method: 对Softmax Loss (SL) 和 Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) 进行了全面的分析，并提出了一种新的损失函数DrRL。

Result: SL和CCL都可以看作是传统损失的增强，具有分布鲁棒优化(DRO)，增强了对分布偏移的鲁棒性。SL对假阴性实例表现出高度敏感性，而CCL存在数据利用率低的问题。

Conclusion: 提出了新的损失函数DrRL，通过在DRO优化中利用R'enyi散度来推广SL和CCL，并有效缓解了它们的局限性。通过大量实验验证了DrRL在推荐准确性和鲁棒性方面的优越性。

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

### [2] [Next-User Retrieval: Enhancing Cold-Start Recommendations via Generative Next-User Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15267)
*Yu-Ting Lan,Yang Huo,Yi Shen,Xiao Yang,Zuotao Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Next-User Retrieval, a novel framework using generative next-user modeling, enhances cold-start recommendations by predicting the next potential user, leading to improvements in user engagement and content publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommendation systems struggle with item cold-start challenges due to their reliance on item and historical interactions, which are lacking for new items. Traditional lookalike algorithms have limitations in modeling lookalike users and utilizing interaction signals.

Method: A transformer-based model is used to capture unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and generate the next potential user. Additional item features are integrated as prefix prompt embeddings.

Result: The Next-User Retrieval method achieves significant improvements with increases of 0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin.

Conclusion: The proposed Next-User Retrieval framework significantly improves cold-start recommendations, as demonstrated by offline experiments and online A/B tests with increases in daily active users and publications in Douyin.

Abstract: The item cold-start problem is critical for online recommendation systems, as
the success of this phase determines whether high-quality new items can
transition to popular ones, receive essential feedback to inspire creators, and
thus lead to the long-term retention of creators. However, modern
recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due
to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are
non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.
Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new
items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such
limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further
improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)
struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features
in modern recommendation systems.
  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel
framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user
modeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the
unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these
sequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact
with the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix
prompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of
Next-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online
A/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of
0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin,
showcasing its practical applicability and scalability.

Conclusion: This survey establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for researchers interested in multi-interest recommendation.

Abstract: Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted
preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as
the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical
scenarios. Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting
multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling
fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has
drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current
recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation
methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this
work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future
directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three
questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for
recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in
recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with
the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey
establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for
researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The
implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is
maintained at https://github.com/WHUIR/Multi-Interest-Recommendation-A-Survey.
