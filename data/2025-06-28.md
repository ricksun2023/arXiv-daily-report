### [1] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark and framework for probabilistic question answering over tabular data, using Bayesian Networks and LLMs to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data fall short on probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: The method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to generate final answers.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data, achieving significant improvements over baselines by using a hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning approach.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [2] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 创建了多语言功能基准来评估大型语言模型在多语言环境中的性能和鲁棒性，发现静态基准captures功能性能的程度不同，并且模型在不同语言中的鲁棒性存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据基准通常无法充分理解模型在多语言环境中的实际性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将现有的功能基准模板从英语翻译成五种额外的语言（法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语）来创建多语言功能基准——跨语言小学数学符号（CL-GSM 符号）和跨语言指令跟踪评估（CL-IFEval）。

Result: 某些静态多语言基准比其他基准更密切地反映功能性能（例如，在英语、法语和西班牙语中，M-GSM 和 CL-GSM 符号之间的性能分别下降 24%、17% 和 18%；同样，Belebele 和 CL-IFEval 之间的性能下降 15% - 24%，而 M-MMLU 和 CL-IFEval 之间的性能下降仅为 0.5% 至 3%）。

Conclusion: 模型在不同语言中的鲁棒性差异显著，某些语言（如阿拉伯语、英语）在评估迭代中表现始终良好。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [3] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的想法在执行后不如专家想法，突显了LLM在生成有效研究想法方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）已显示出在加速科学研究流程方面的希望。此过程的关键能力是生成新颖的研究想法的能力，并且先前的研究发现，在某些情况下，LLM生成的研究想法被认为比人类专家的想法更具新颖性。

Method: 招募43位专家研究人员来执行随机分配的想法，这些想法由专家撰写或由LLM生成。每位专家花费超过100小时来实施这些想法，并撰写一份4页的简短论文来记录实验。

Result: LLM生成的想法的得分下降幅度明显大于专家撰写的想法，缩小了在构思阶段观察到的LLM与人类想法之间的差距。在执行研究的汇总审查得分进行比较时，我们甚至观察到，在许多指标上，人类的想法得分都高于LLM的想法。

Conclusion: LLM生成的想法在执行后的得分下降幅度大于专家撰写的想法，表明当前LLM在生成真正有效的研究想法方面存在局限性，并且在没有执行结果的情况下评估研究想法存在挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [4] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG是一种RAG框架，专为金融QA而构建，它通过多模态提取、模态感知检索和分层回退策略，在复杂金融QA任务中优于ChatGPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回答此类内容的问题通常需要在各种模态之间进行联合推理，这给传统的 LLM 和 RAG 管道带来了压力，因为它们存在令牌限制、布局损失和碎片化的跨模态上下文。

Method: MultiFinRAG首先执行多模态提取，将表格和图形图像分组为批次，然后将它们发送到轻量级的量化开源多模态 LLM，从而生成结构化的 JSON 输出和简洁的文本摘要。这些输出与叙述性文本一起被嵌入和索引，并具有模态感知相似性阈值，以实现精确检索。然后，分层回退策略在必要时从纯文本动态升级到文本+表格+图像上下文，从而在减少不相关上下文的同时实现跨模态推理。

Result: MultiFinRAG在涉及文本、表格、图像和组合多模态推理的复杂金融 QA 任务中，比 ChatGPT-4o（免费层）的准确率高 19 个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG在涉及文本、表格、图像和组合多模态推理的复杂金融 QA 任务中，比 ChatGPT-4o（免费层）的准确率高 19 个百分点。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

### [5] [Uncovering Hidden Violent Tendencies in LLMs: A Demographic Analysis via Behavioral Vignettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20822)
*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用暴力行为小品问卷 (VBVQ) 评估 LLM，该问卷旨在衡量人类对日常冲突的反应，结果表明 LLM 的暴力倾向因人口统计而异，这与犯罪学、社会科学和心理学中的既有发现相悖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地被提议用于检测和响应在线暴力内容，但它们对道德上模棱两可的现实世界场景的推理能力仍未得到检验。

Method: 使用经过验证的社会科学工具（即暴力行为小品问卷 VBVQ）评估 LLM，该工具旨在衡量人类对日常冲突的反应。为了评估潜在的偏见，我们引入了基于角色的提示，这些提示在美国境内改变了种族、年龄和地理身份。在统一的零样本设置下评估了在不同地缘政治和组织环境中开发的六个 LLM。

Result: (1) LLM 的表面文本生成通常与其对暴力反应的内部偏好不同；(2) 它们的暴力倾向因人口统计而异，这经常与犯罪学、社会科学和心理学中的既有发现相矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs的暴力倾向因人口统计而异，这与犯罪学、社会科学和心理学中的既有发现相悖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

### [6] [Decide less, communicate more: On the construct validity of end-to-end fact-checking in medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20876)
*Sebastian Joseph,Lily Chen,Barry Wei,Michael Mackert,Iain J. Marshall,Paul Pu Liang,Ramez Kouzy,Byron C. Wallace,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Clinical experts face challenges verifying real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence, suggesting fact-checking should be interactive, not end-to-end.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high-stakes nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and diverse medical literature.

Method: A study examining how clinical experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.

Result: Difficulties connecting claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials; ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and inherently subjective veracity labels.

Conclusion: Fact-checking should be approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than an end-to-end process.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

### [7] [Optimising Language Models for Downstream Tasks: A Post-Training Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20917)
*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis proposes methods to better adapt LMs to downstream applications by extracting task-relevant knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and improving supervised fine-tuning methods. New evaluation methods and benchmarks are also developed to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more comprehensively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LMs efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging due to underutilization of unlabelled data, overfitting on small task-specific sets, and significant computational costs.

Method: a novel continued pre-training technique, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, and improved supervised fine-tuning methods

Result: The proposed methods improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches substantially improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

*Guilherme Penedo,Hynek Kydlíček,Vinko Sabolčec,Bettina Messmer,Negar Foroutan,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Colin Raffel,Martin Jaggi,Leandro Von Werra,Thomas Wolf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的多语言预训练数据集管理流程，并创建了一个新的20TB多语言数据集FineWeb2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练高性能的多语言LLM仍然是一个挑战，这主要是由于为大量语言定制过滤和去重流程的固有困难。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的基于FineWeb的预训练数据集管理流程，可以自动适应以支持任何语言。此外，还提出了一种直接且有原则的方法来重新平衡数据集，该方法同时考虑了重复计数和质量。

Result: 该研究表明，他们的流程可以用于创建非英语语料库，与先前的数据集相比，可以生成性能更高的模型。此外，通过考虑重复计数和质量来重新平衡数据集，从而进一步提高了性能。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个可扩展到1000多种语言的，大小为20TB的新多语言数据集FineWeb2，并发布了其流程、训练和评估代码库。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

*Xinping Zhao,Xinshuo Hu,Zifei Shan,Shouzheng Huang,Yao Zhou,Zetian Sun,Zhenyu Liu,Dongfang Li,Xinyuan Wei,Qian Chen,Youcheng Pan,Yang Xiang,Meishan Zhang,Haofen Wang,Jun Yu,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2 是一种通用且紧凑的嵌入模型，通过创新的训练技术和数据，在文本嵌入任务中取得了出色的性能，并设立了新的标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用文本嵌入模型在性能和模型大小之间需要权衡，该论文旨在创建一个通用且紧凑的嵌入模型，在参数量较小的情况下实现出色的性能。

Method: 该模型采用全双向 Transformer 结构，并结合均值池化生成固定长度的嵌入。训练过程包括：(1) 在大规模弱监督开源语料库上进行预训练；(2) 在高质量检索和非检索数据集上进行微调；(3) 使用模型汤参数平均以实现稳健的泛化。此外，还引入了 focal-style 重加权机制和在线硬负例混合策略。

Result: 在 MTEB 中文和英文基准测试中，KaLM-Embedding-V2 模型显著优于其他同等大小的模型，并与更大的模型竞争。

Conclusion: KaLM-Embedding-V2 模型在通用文本嵌入任务中表现出色，在参数小于 1B 的情况下，性能显著优于其他同等规模的模型，并与更大的模型竞争，为通用且紧凑的嵌入模型设立了新标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

### [10] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个半监督可扩展统一框架 (SSUF) 用于电子商务查询分类，该框架通过知识增强、标签增强和结构增强模块来解决现有方法的不足，实验结果表明 SSUF 优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务查询通常很短且缺乏上下文，并且标签之间的信息无法使用，导致建模的先验信息不足。大多数现有的工业查询分类方法依赖于用户后验点击行为来构建训练样本，导致马太效应恶性循环。此外，查询分类的子任务缺乏统一的框架，导致算法优化效率低下。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的半监督可扩展统一框架 (SSUF)，包含多个增强模块来统一查询分类任务。

Result: 离线和在线 A/B 实验表明，SSUF 显著优于最先进的模型。

Conclusion: SSUF显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

### [11] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种元训练LM的方法，该方法使梯度更新能够模拟调节新信息的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将新信息融入语言模型（LM）的两种主要方法：更改其prompt或更改其参数，例如通过微调。Parameter更新不会产生模型更改的长期存储成本。但是，对于许多模型更新，prompting明显更有效：prompted模型可以从单个示例中稳健地概括，并得出在标准微调下不会发生的逻辑推论。模型是否可以被修改，以使微调能够模拟prompting？

Method: 使用基于梯度的元学习工具，但使用LM自己的prompted预测作为目标，从而无需ground-truth标签。

Result: 梯度下降训练恢复了prompted模型的部分（有时是全部）性能——在“逆转诅咒”任务和在一次梯度更新后回答有关文本段落的问题方面表现出改进。

Conclusion: 梯度下降可以非常具有表现力。适当的初始化可以使梯度下降训练恢复prompted模型的性能，并在“逆转诅咒”任务和回答文本段落问题方面表现出改进。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

### [12] [Enhancing Automatic Term Extraction with Large Language Models via Syntactic Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21222)
*Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Dongjun Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a syntactic retrieval method to improve LLMs' performance on automatic term extraction (ATE) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined.

Method: A retrieval-based prompting strategy that selects demonstrations according to syntactic rather than semantic similarity.

Result: Syntactic retrieval improves F1-score on three specialized ATE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Syntactic cues are important when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

### [13] [SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20993)
*Adithya Chittem,Aishna Shrivastava,Sai Tarun Pendela,Jagat Sesh Challa,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for modeling LLM personalities using the 16PF model and a structured framework for controlling trait intensity, resulting in more consistent and controllable personality expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personality models rely on the Big Five framework, which only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for controlling trait intensity.

Method: The authors extended the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model and developed a structured framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. The method introduces adjective-based semantic anchoring and leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors.

Result: The study found that modeling intensity as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related traits in psychologically coherent directions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that modeling trait intensity as a continuous spectrum yields more consistent and controllable personality expression in LLMs, and that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence related traits in psychologically coherent directions. This opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型正在显著改变金融实践，但它们在多大程度上有效地捕捉和应用特定领域的财务知识仍不确定。本文旨在解决印度金融领域中这一关键空白。

Method: 构建了一个名为 CA-Ben 的特许会计基准，用于评估大型语言模型在财务、法律和定量推理方面的能力。该基准包含来自印度特许会计师协会 (ICAI) 考试的结构化问答数据集。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet 和 GPT-4o 在概念和法律推理方面表现优于其他模型，但在数值计算和法律解释方面面临挑战。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在财务、法律和定量推理方面存在优势和局限性，尤其是在数值计算和法律解释方面面临挑战。未来的改进方向包括混合推理和检索增强生成方法。

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

TL;DR: Omni-RAG is a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings by handling complex and noisy queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and contain multiple intents. Current systems typically struggle with such complex inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data.

Method: Omni-RAG employs LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, and (3) Reranking and Generation.

Result: Omni-RAG improves the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings.

Conclusion: Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG capabilities and the demands of real-world applications by robustly handling complex and noisy queries.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文着眼于大型语言模型在不同语言的数据库查询生成任务中的表现，发现现有模型在英语之外的其他语言表现不佳，并强调需要在多语言环境下进行更全面的评估和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数研究仅关注英语，而对其他语言的评估有限。本文研究了基础LLM在多种语言的Text2Cypher任务上的性能。

Method: 通过将英语问题翻译成西班牙语和土耳其语，同时保留原始的Cypher查询，创建并发布了一个多语言测试集，从而实现了公平的跨语言比较。使用标准化提示和指标评估了多个基础模型。

Result: 结果显示出一致的性能模式：英语最高，其次是西班牙语，土耳其语最低。这归因于训练数据可用性和语言特征的差异。此外，将任务提示翻译成西班牙语和土耳其语对评估指标几乎没有影响，这表明提示翻译的影响很小。

Conclusion: 在多语言查询生成中，需要更具包容性的评估和开发。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于多目标、多轮会话立场检测的综合数据集 MT2-CSD，并提出了一个大型语言模型增强的会话关系注意力网络 (LLM-CRAN)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的立场检测研究通常针对个体实例，从而限制了其对真实社交媒体场景中典型的多方讨论进行建模的能力。这种缺点主要源于缺乏真实捕捉社交媒体互动动态的数据集，阻碍了会话立场检测的进步。

Method: 提出了一种大型语言模型增强的会话关系注意力网络 (LLM-CRAN)，它利用 LLM 的推理能力来提高会话理解。

Result: LLM-CRAN 在 MT2-CSD 数据集上的有效性进行了广泛的实验评估。实验结果表明，LLM-CRAN 在会话立场检测任务中显著优于强大的基线模型。

Conclusion: LLM-CRAN 在会话立场检测任务中显著优于强大的基线模型。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A chunk-based multi-SSL fusion approach improves automatic fluency assessment, but has limitations with dialects with irregular prosody.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers.

Method: Chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) with a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework.

Result: Improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines.

Conclusion: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion improves fluency evaluation, but generalization to dialects with irregular prosody needs further exploration.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: ComRAG是一种用于实时工业CQA的检索增强生成框架，它优于现有方法，并在三个工业CQA数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地利用实时历史互动和领域知识仍然是一个挑战。现有方法通常不能充分利用外部知识，无法整合动态历史QA上下文，或者缺乏适合工业部署的记忆机制。

Method: 提出了ComRAG，一种用于实时工业CQA的检索增强生成框架，该框架通过基于质心的存储机制将静态知识与动态历史QA对集成，该机制专为检索、生成和高效存储而设计。

Result: ComRAG在向量相似度上实现了高达 25.9% 的改进，延迟降低了 8.7% 至 23.3%，并且迭代过程中块增长从 20.23% 降低至 2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG在三个工业CQA数据集上始终优于所有基线，向量相似度提高了 25.9%，延迟降低了 8.7% 至 23.3%，并且块增长从 20.23% 降低至 2.06%。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

TL;DR: Progtuning 通过逐步减少更新的 Transformer 块的数量来优化资源分配并减少更新的参数数量，同时保持了竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型尺寸持续增长，更新所有模型参数的成本越来越高。参数高效的微调方法通过选择性地更新一小部分参数来有效解决此问题。但是，微调和大多数现有的参数高效微调方法需要更新与初始大小相同数量的参数，忽略了 Transformer 块之间的不均等贡献，从而导致计算资源的分配效率极低。

Method: Progtuning，一种新颖的微调框架，结合了基于 Transformer 的语言模型的渐进学习。

Result: Progtuning 将更新的参数数量减少了大约 25%，同时仍保持了竞争性能。它还通过参数高效的微调方法表现出高适应性，在各种适应场景中表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: Progtuning优化了资源分配，并将更新的参数数量减少了大约 25%，同时仍保持了竞争性能。它还通过参数高效的微调方法表现出高适应性，在各种适应场景中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

TL;DR: Cosmos是一种新的文本生成方法，它在压缩的潜在空间中运行，速度更快，质量更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在现代文本生成中占据主导地位，但它们的顺序性质引入了根本的限制：解码速度慢，并且保持全局连贯性仍然具有挑战性。扩散模型通过实现并行生成和灵活控制提供了一个有希望的替代方案；然而，它们在文本生成中的应用受到token级表示的高维性的阻碍。

Method: 提出了一种名为Cosmos的文本生成新方法，该方法完全在压缩的、平滑的潜在空间中运行，该空间专为扩散而定制。这个空间是使用一个自编码器学习的，该自编码器同时进行token级重建和与来自预训练语言编码器的冻结激活对齐，从而提供强大的语义基础并实现有效的基于扰动的增强。

Result: 文本表示可以压缩8倍，同时保持与token级扩散模型相当的生成质量。此外，增加潜在序列长度允许Cosmos超越基于扩散和自回归的基线。

Conclusion: Cosmos在多种生成任务上实现了可比或更优的生成质量，同时提供了超过2倍的更快推理速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Conclusion: 提出的模型提高了预测精度，并根据文本提示有效地改变了轮流说话的时间行为。

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Motivation: 由于缺乏外部反馈的限制，多模态代理在自我纠正和泛化方面存在困难。一个有希望的方法是使用奖励模型作为外部反馈，但目前尚不清楚如何为代理选择奖励模型。因此，迫切需要构建一个针对代理的奖励平台。

Method: 我们提出了 Agent-RewardBench，这是一个旨在评估 MLLM 中奖励建模能力的基准。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的多模态模型也表现出有限的性能，这突出表明需要在代理奖励建模方面进行专门训练。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的多模态模型也表现出有限的性能，这突出表明需要在代理奖励建模方面进行专门训练。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: investigate the detection of artificially generated text

Method: statistical classifiers to identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction

Result: Gemini showed an increased ability to generate deceptive text, while GPT did not.

Conclusion: reliable detection of fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

TL;DR: Double-Checker通过迭代自评提升了LLM的推理能力，并在AIME测试中取得显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维缓慢的LLM表现出类似反思的推理能力，但它们生成信息丰富的评论和改进先前解决方案的能力仍然有限。

Method: 引入Double-Checker框架，通过显式的自我批判和迭代改进来增强LLM的推理能力；在1,730个自我批判实例上进行微调。

Result: Double-Checker在多个推理基准测试中验证了其有效性，尤其是在AIME基准测试中pass@1性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Double-Checker通过迭代自评显著增强了long-CoT LLM的推理能力，在AIME基准测试中，pass@1性能从4.4%提高到18.2%。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using a text-only language model to extract referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue. It finds it can be effective but argues the task is inherently multimodal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue and investigate the extent to which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that have a visually perceivable referent.

Method: Adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to perform a course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token prediction.

Result: A text-only approach can be effective even when using a moderately sized LLM, relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: A text-only approach can be effective in extracting referring expressions, highlighting the importance of linguistic context, but the task is inherently multimodal and unimodal approaches have limitations.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework to detect fake conversations and concept drift in dynamic platforms. The framework achieves high accuracy and outperforms baselines by incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting deceptive conversations is increasingly difficult due to evolving language patterns and concept drift, which obscures malicious intent and challenges accurate classification. LLMs often struggle with contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The paper presents a DK-Enhanced LLM framework consisting of a DK-LLM module for detecting fake conversations, a drift detection unit (OCDD), and a second DK-LLM module to classify the drift as benign or fraudulent. The framework integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights.

Result: The DK-Enhanced LLM framework detects fake conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. The LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy. Incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed DK-Enhanced LLM framework effectively detects fake conversations, classifies the nature of drift, and achieves high accuracy (98% with LLaMA-based implementation). It also demonstrates improved performance, interpretability, and robustness compared to zero-shot baselines.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopK LMs, a modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across different checkpoints.

Method: We introduce a modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE.

Result: The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers.

Conclusion: TopK LMs are stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future research on model interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).

by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE

Result: Online and semi-online methods strongly outperform offline methods, with similar performance and convergence between Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization variants.

Conclusion: Multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for

experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable

these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

TL;DR: 通过利用对话的未来信号并采用用户反应作为奖励，该研究旨在提高社交对话中交互式LLM的用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究已经优化了模型以推理相关知识或规划对话行为流程，但用户参与度和知识或对话行为之间的关系是微妙的，并不能保证社交驱动对话中的用户参与度。

Method: 通过利用对话未来发展的信号，使交互式LLM能够学习用户参与度。具体来说，采用与交互后对话意图相关的用户反应作为奖励，以调整交互式LLM。开发了一个用户模拟器，通过 i×MCTS 探索用户与交互式LLM系统之间的交互，收集包含高质量和低质量体验的数据集，并通过直接偏好优化 (DPO) 对齐交互式LLM。

Result: 在两种社交驱动的对话场景（情感支持对话和劝导向善）中进行的实验表明，该方法有效地提高了交互式LLM中的用户参与度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了交互式LLM中的用户参与度。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

Motivation: Justifying inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to curated questions.

Method: Two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: a specially designed benchmark in three domains, and a general procedure providing a lower-bound on their prevalence.

Result: LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that do not mirror human misunderstandings. Success on benchmarks demonstrates potemkin understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable with how any human would interpret a concept.

Conclusion: Potemkin understanding is ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains, reflecting deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv是一种新的MIL框架，它通过最优传输来建模WSI中的病理异质性，并在生存预测方面取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MIL方法通常无法明确地捕捉WSI中的病理异质性，包括全局的（通过长尾形态分布）和局部的（通过tile-level预测不确定性）。

Method: OTSurv，一个从最优传输角度提出的新的MIL框架。具体来说，OTSurv将生存预测公式化为一个具有异质性意识的OT问题，具有两个约束：(1)全局长尾约束，通过调节传输质量分配来模拟先前的形态分布，以避免模式崩溃和过度均匀性；(2)局部不确定性感知约束，通过逐步提高总传输质量来优先考虑高置信度patches，同时抑制噪声。

Result: OTSurv在六个常用基准测试中取得了新的最先进的结果，在平均C指数上实现了3.6%的绝对改进。

Conclusion: OTSurv在六个常用基准测试中取得了新的最先进的结果，在平均C指数上实现了3.6%的绝对改进。此外，OTSurv在log-rank测试中实现了统计学意义，并提供了很高的可解释性，使其成为数字病理学中生存预测的强大工具。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDiff combines stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic regions in videos for better depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation because the temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different.

Method: StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator, synergizes stereo matching for static areas with video depth diffusion for dynamic areas.

Result: Stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths. StereoDiff achieves SoTA performance with superior consistency and accuracy.

Conclusion: StereoDiff achieves SoTA performance on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, demonstrating superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Motivation: 之前的研究试图联合学习视觉-触觉表征，以提取更有意义的信息。然而，这些方法通常依赖于直接组合(如特征相加和连接)进行模态融合，这往往导致较差的特征整合。

Method: 提出了一种视觉-触觉表示学习网络ConViTac，它使用对比表示来增强融合过程中特征的对齐。关键贡献是对比嵌入调节(CEC)机制，该机制利用通过自监督对比学习预训练的对比编码器，将视觉和触觉输入投影到统一的潜在嵌入中。

Result: 在真实环境中进行了大量实验，以证明ConViTac优于当前最先进的方法，并证明了所提出的CEC机制的有效性。

Conclusion: ConViTac在材料分类和抓取预测任务中，精度提高了12.0%，证明了其优越性和CEC机制的有效性。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估和比较了多种promptable模型在医学图像分割任务中的性能，发现SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下表现出色，但nnU-Net由于提示的实用性仍然占主导地位。通过在儿科数据集上对SAM等模型进行微调，点提示性能得到显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来涌现了许多通用可提示模型和医学变体，但目前缺乏在常见医学数据集上，针对各种提示质量对这些模型进行评估和比较。

Method: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, 和 nnU-Net 在 BraTS 2023 成人神经胶质瘤和儿科数据集上，通过多种提示质量，对点和边界框进行zero-shot推理。

Result: 多个模型表现出有希望的Dice系数，特别是SAM和SAM 2在获得极其精确的边界框提示时，分别达到了高达0.894和0.893的分数，超过了nnU-Net的分割性能。然而，由于向模型提供高度精确的提示不切实际，nnU-Net仍然是主要的医学图像分割网络。

Conclusion: 虽然经过微调后点提示性能有显著提高，并显示出未来研究的希望，但无法实现比边界框或nnU-Net更好的分割效果。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了将视觉基础模型和视觉语言模型应用于动态全身手势识别，并与传统方法进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，基于深度学习的手势识别依赖于使用图像、视频或骨骼姿势估计作为输入的任务特定架构。具有强大泛化能力的视觉基础模型（VFM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）有潜力通过替换专用任务特定模块来降低系统复杂性。

Method: 比较了V-JEPA（一种先进的VFM）、Gemini Flash 2.0（一种多模态VLM）和HD-GCN（一种性能最佳的基于骨架的方法），以适应动态的全身手势识别。

Result: HD-GCN实现了最佳性能，但V-JEPA紧随其后，Gemini难以区分手势。

Conclusion: HD-GCN在手势识别方面表现最佳，但V-JEPA通过简单的任务特定分类头也能达到接近的性能，这为降低系统复杂性提供了可能，可以将其用作共享多任务模型。Gemini在零样本设置中难以仅根据文本描述区分手势，表明需要进一步研究合适的手势输入表示。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using VLMs to select trustworthy SR images from a diffusion-generated set, along with a new metric (TWS) that correlates with human preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem. Regressive SR models introduce artifacts, and diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution remains a challenge.

Method: A robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs).

Result: The proposed Trustworthiness Score (TWS) correlates strongly with human preference, and VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. The approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space.

Conclusion: This work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR by aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR, a semi-supervised domain generalization method, adapts contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization by using class information from pseudo-labels and a repelling term. It can be combined with other methods for performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing SSDG methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization

Method: introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term

Result: FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains.

Conclusion: FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many

combined with other semi-supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对比学习框架COVER，用于改进医学图像的像素级自监督预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将对比学习扩展到像素级表示仍然是一个开放的问题。标准的对比学习将自监督预训练形式化为二元优化问题，过度追求特征分散导致过度分散问题，打破了像素级特征相关性，从而扰乱了类内分布。

Method: 将对比学习重新表述为向量回归问题，通过对位移向量进行回归来建模特征距离，从而实现像素级预训练中的离散量化。

Result: 在跨越2个维度和4种模态的8项任务中，COVER显著提高了像素级的自监督预训练。

Conclusion: COVER显著改进了像素级的自监督预训练，推动了通用医学视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Result: 在 DFEW 数据集和 FERV39k-Plus 数据集上进行的实验表明，使用 MIDAS 增强数据训练的模型取得了优异的性能。

Conclusion: 模型在经过 MIDAS 增强的数据集上训练后，性能优于在原始数据集上训练的最先进方法。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

TL;DR: ThirdEye is a cue-aware pipeline that uses pre-trained networks to supply monocular cues, fused in a cortical hierarchy with a working-memory module and a transformer head, to produce a high-resolution disparity map. Quantitative results are forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation methods often overlook explicit monocular cues that the human visual system relies on.

Method: A cue-aware pipeline (ThirdEye) that uses specialized, pre-trained, and frozen networks to supply monocular cues, fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy with a key-value working-memory module and an adaptive-bins transformer head.

Result: Quantitative results will appear in a future revision.

Conclusion: ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline, fuses monocular cues in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) with a key-value working-memory module and an adaptive-bins transformer head to produce a high-resolution disparity map.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Motivation: challenging multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the wall to yellow.

Method: combines fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$ search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath and inductive reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning

Result: The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent FaSTA*

Conclusion: FaSTA* is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

<details>

Conclusion: M2SFormer在检测和定位伪造品方面优于现有模型，并在未见过的领域中提供卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhysRig, a differentiable physics-based skinning and rigging framework that overcomes the limitations of LBS by embedding the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation and simulating it as a deformable soft-body. It outperforms LBS in generating realistic results and is applicable to pose transfer tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft tissues, fur, and flexible appendages.

Method: A differentiable physics-based skinning and rigging framework is proposed that embeds the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation, which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated skeleton. The method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid. Material prototypes are introduced to reduce the learning space.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms traditional LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible results. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated in the pose transfer task.

Conclusion: The proposed PhysRig framework outperforms traditional LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible results, and its applicability is demonstrated in the pose transfer task.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object

datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation,
of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are
absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of
a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HST-CSLR, a new approach for continuous sign language recognition that combines gloss knowledge with visual representation learning using a hierarchical sub-action tree. It achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck for CSLR.

Method: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST) to combine gloss knowledge with visual representation learning. It aligns visual and textual modalities step-by-step and uses contrastive alignment enhancement.

Result: Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HST-CSLR.

Conclusion: The paper introduces HST-CSLR and demonstrates its effectiveness on four datasets.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide

Motivation: 直接将现有的视频编辑方法应用于Video DiTs通常会产生大量的计算开销，这是因为资源密集型的注意修改或微调。

Method: 通过流变换直接对干净的潜在因素进行操作，无需注意修改和微调。提出条件Delta流向量（CDFV），并集成隐式交叉注意（ICA）指导以及嵌入增强（ER）以进一步提高编辑质量。

Result: DFVEdit在实际效率方面表现出色，与基于注意工程的编辑方法相比，在Video DiTs上至少提供20倍的推理速度提升和85%的内存减少。

Conclusion: DFVEdit可以无缝应用于流行的Video DiTs（例如，CogVideoX和Wan2.1），在结构保真度、时空一致性和编辑质量方面达到最先进的性能。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在整个生命周期中实现逼真和无缝的转换，尤其是在处理大的年龄差距或极端的头部姿势时。核心挑战在于平衡年龄准确性和身份保持。

Method: 基于few-step text-to-image (T2I) 扩散模型，提出了一个名为Cradle2Cane的两阶段面部老化框架。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试数据集上进行了大量实验，通过Face++和Qwen-VL协议评估，表明Cradle2Cane优于现有的面部老化方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有的面部老化方法。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed method can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集表示提出了新的挑战，包括编辑困难和与文本提示的潜在不一致。稀疏信号的简单性和与形状无关的性质仍未被充分探索。

Method: 扩展OpenPose到可学习的空间表示，使关键点嵌入具有区分性和表达性。引入关键点概念学习，鼓励关键点token关注每个关键点的空间位置，从而提高姿态对齐。

Result: SP-Ctrl在动物和以人为中心的图像生成任务上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最近的空间可控T2I生成方法，甚至与基于密集信号的方法的性能相匹配。

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl在稀疏姿态引导下优于最近的空间可控T2I生成方法，甚至与基于密集信号的方法的性能相匹配。SP-Ctrl在通过稀疏信号进行多样化和跨物种生成方面显示出有希望的能力。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

Motivation: 现有的 CZSL 方法通常通过简单的组合-原型映射来导出原始特征，这对于可以分为不同语义子集的一组个体来说是次优的。此外，全对一的跨模态原始匹配忽略了相同状态或对象内的组合差异，限制了细粒度的图像组合对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法在封闭和开放世界的三个流行基准上显著优于其他最先进的 CZSL 方法，证明了所提出见解的有效性。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: 该模型在动态模糊场景下的新视角合成方面表现出色，并在模糊单目视频输入的真实新视角合成方面树立了新的基准。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Conclusion: SAIC-synthesized images enhance the performance and robustness of abnormal cell detection, improving overall detection performance. SAIC is generalizable and practical in clinical application scenarios.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

Conclusion: Inverse STR (ISTR) 可以通过高精度完成二元分类（检测图像是否经过 STR）和定位删除的文本区域，从而能够检测潜在的误用并改进 STR。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

TL;DR: VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework, enhances helmet violation detection by integrating Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules, improving mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and disrupt consistent object classification.

Method: VisionGuard integrates two key components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively addressing the impact of data imbalance.

Result: VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors.

Conclusion: VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the

propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度学习框架 FFCL-SAM，用于提高术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，从而有可能减少乳腺癌治疗中的再切除率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D 标本放射线照相 (SR) 的准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外的手术。

Method: 结合了 Segment Anything Model (SAM) 与 Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL) 的新型深度学习框架。

Result: 边缘分类的 AUC 达到 0.8455，分割边缘的 Dice 相似性比基线模型提高了 27.4%，同时每次图像的推理时间减少到 47 毫秒。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM 显著提高了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，具有降低再切除率和改善乳腺癌治疗手术效果的强大潜力。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们介绍了老化多元宇宙，这是一个从单个图像生成多个合理的面部老化轨迹的框架，每个轨迹都以环境、健康和生活方式等外部因素为条件。与先前将老化建模为单一确定性路径的方法不同，我们的方法创建了一个可视化不同未来的老化树。

Method: 我们提出了一种免训练的基于扩散的方法，该方法平衡了身份保持、年龄准确性和条件控制。

Result: 大量的实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份保持、老化真实感和条件对齐方面表现出最先进的性能，优于现有的编辑和年龄增长模型，这些模型通常未能考虑一个或多个编辑标准。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将老化转化为多维、可控和可解释的过程，为数字叙事、健康教育和个性化可视化开辟了新的创造性和实践途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR approaches for novel view synthesis are mentally demanding, limit capture areas, and rely on restrictive sampling theory and 3D annotations.

Method: using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be removed by inserting new views

Result: error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples. Contributes to radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes (3D Gaussian splatting).

Conclusion: The error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. The approach can contribute to recent radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field

### [75] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for video quality assessment using large multimodal models (LMMs). It proposes a Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline to create a large dataset (S2I) for instruction tuning, and a new benchmark (S2I-Bench) to evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. The results show improvements in both quality scoring and justification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score, failing to describe the video's complex quality dimensions and restricting its applicability. Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes a Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline that scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled video, maps scores to text-defined levels, and incorporates a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific dimensions and overall quality. A progressive tuning strategy is devised to enhance video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities. A benchmark termed S2I-Bench is curated to evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs.

Result: The resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs. Experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that the proposed method consistently improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs.

Conclusion: The proposed Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline and the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset improve video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities. The S2I-Bench benchmark is introduced to evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in quality scoring and justification across multiple video LMMs.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes FedSC, a federated learning method that uses semantic information to address data heterogeneity. It uses relational and consistent prototypes and demonstrates improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the data heterogeneity issue in federated learning (FL), which refers to the biased labeling preferences at multiple clients, while neglecting inherent semantic information contained in each client.

Method: The paper proposes Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC) to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous clients by constructing relational prototypes and consistent prototypes at the semantic-level. It introduces an inter-contrastive learning strategy and devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner.

Result: Experimental results on various challenging scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial components.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical analysis for FedSC to ensure a convergence guarantee and demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial components through experiments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: 该模型在数据增强方面表现出色，性能提升与最先进的经典生成模型相当，但参数减少了 25 倍以上，训练 epoch 减少了 10 倍。

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions.

Method: A multimodal prompt alignment framework (MPA-FER) with multi-granularity hard prompt generation using LLMs, prototype-guided visual feature alignment, and a cross-modal global-local alignment module.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MPA-FER framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex

at both global and local levels based on attention information from different

Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data.

First, integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, devise a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss. Finally, incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding precise, fine-grained depth maps.

TL;DR: Proposes a diffusion model approach to domain generalization and adaptation in object detection, improving efficiency and performance through intermediate feature extraction, object-centered auxiliary branches, and feature-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between training and testing data.

Conclusion: This work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant

TL;DR: FGS enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability in text-guided diffusion models for image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving optimal results in image editing is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness.

Method: We propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness.

Result: FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability.

Conclusion: FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability and its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Motivation: 以往的研究普遍利用监督学习中的中间特征，而本文受到自监督学习和Transformer架构之间协同作用的启发，探索利用自监督Vision Transformer（ViT）表示来提高对抗性可迁移性。

Method: 提出了一种生成式双重自监督ViT特征攻击（dSVA），利用对比学习（CL）的全局结构特征和掩蔽图像建模（MIM）的局部纹理特征。

Result: CL和MIM使ViT能够关注不同的特征趋势，当它们协同利用时，具有很好的对抗泛化能力。实现了卓越的黑盒可迁移性，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过扰乱自监督ViT提炼的双重深度特征，实现了卓越的黑盒可迁移性，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

Conclusion: EgoAdapt显著提高了效率，同时保持甚至超过了现有最佳模型的性能。

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal

speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.
Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,
EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task (RoI-Matching) and benchmark (RoI-Matching-Bench) for flexible document region matching and proposes an effective framework (RoI-Matcher) using siamese networks and cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document analysis solutions lack flexibility and customizability for users, being limited to fixed categories and granularities.

Method: A siamese network is used to extract multi-level features from reference and target documents, and cross-attention layers integrate and align similar semantics across domains.

Result: The proposed RoI-Matcher framework demonstrates effectiveness on the RoI-Matching-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed RoI-Matcher framework, with its siamese network and cross-attention layers, effectively addresses the RoI-Matching task on the RoI-Matching-Bench benchmark, establishing a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: SAMURAI：一种用于3D对象识别的形状感知多模态检索方法，它结合了CLIP语义匹配和形状引导的重排序，在ROOMELSA数据集上取得了有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅使用一个被掩蔽的2D图像和一个自然语言描述在复杂的室内环境中检索3D对象提出了重大挑战。ROOMELSA挑战限制了对完整3D场景上下文的访问，使关于对象外观、几何形状和语义的推理变得复杂。扭曲的视点、无纹理的掩蔽区域、模糊的语言提示和嘈杂的分割掩码加剧了这些挑战。

Method: SAMURAI集成了基于CLIP的语义匹配与源自掩蔽区域的二值轮廓的形状引导的重排序，以及稳健的多数投票策略。一个专门的预处理管道通过提取最大连通分量和去除背景噪声来提高掩码质量。混合检索框架利用语言和形状线索。

Result: 在ROOMELSA私有测试集上实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 结合形状先验知识与语言理解对于稳健的开放世界3D对象检索至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态推理模型，通过强化学习和全局上下文理解来解决现有模型中的问题，并在IntentBench基准测试中取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大型语言模型的快速发展，深入理解和解释人类意图的能力已成为一项关键能力，这需要详细和周密的推理。在最近的研究中，强化学习（RL）已显示出增强大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力的潜力。然而，将RL应用于多模态数据和格式的挑战在很大程度上仍未得到解决。在本文中，我们发现了现有多模态推理模型中的两个问题：全局上下文理解不足和shortcut问题。

Method: 为了确保准确解释多模态上下文信息，我们实施了一种由大型语言模型判断的上下文奖励，以及格式和准确性奖励。此外，为了提高复杂的推理能力，我们采用LLM来评估逻辑奖励，确定推理过程是否成功地将多模态信息与逻辑方法相结合。我们还引入了一个推理全模态基准，IntentBench，旨在评估模型在理解复杂的人类意图和情感方面的能力。

Result: 我们提出的方法在多个全模态基准测试中表现出比其他开源全模态模型更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个全模态基准测试中表现出比其他开源全模态模型更优越的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

TL;DR: PoseMaster是一个端到端的可控3D角色生成框架，它统一了姿势转换和3D角色生成，并能精确控制任意姿势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高3D角色建模的效率，最近的基于图像的方法使用两个独立的模型来实现姿势标准化和A-pose角色的3D重建。然而，由于自我遮挡和视点，这些方法容易在姿势标准化阶段生成扭曲和退化的图像，这进一步影响了后续重建过程的几何质量。

Method: 将姿势转换和3D角色生成统一到一个基于流的3D原生生成框架中。利用可动画角色骨骼中存在的3D身体骨骼作为姿势条件。随机清空姿势条件和图像条件，以提高姿势控制的有效性和泛化性。

Result: PoseMaster在定性和定量评估中优于当前最先进的技术。

Conclusion: PoseMaster在A-pose角色生成方面优于当前最先进的技术，并在定性和定量评估中展示了其对任意姿势进行精确控制的强大能力。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios due to the lack of multi-shot annotations in existing datasets and the discrete/lossy encoding of instance features in current models.

Method: A new model IPFormer-VideoLLM is introduced, which injects instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.

Result: A new dataset MultiClip-Bench is introduced, and the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance. The testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model enhance multi-scene video understanding and offer advantages across various video benchmarks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to improve the accuracy of stereo matching with small-scale cost volumes for real-time performance. The compact version achieves 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX Orin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost volumes, which require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure highly accurate disparity estimation.

Method: The Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) is proposed to mitigate information loss associated with small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene geometry.

Result: The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a highly accurate disparity map at real-time.

Conclusion: The compact version of ESMStereo achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX Orin.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient

Conclusion: FlickCD在计算和存储开销方面减少了一个数量级以上，同时实现了最先进的性能或仅产生较小的精度损失。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute

segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various

foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏相应的数据集，基于学习的方法在低光 RAW 图像增强方面取得了可喜的进展，但其在环境照度降至 0.0001 lux 的极暗场景中的能力仍有待探索。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了...

Method: 该论文提出了一种配对到配对的数据合成管道，能够生成在三个精确照度范围（0.01-0.1 lux、0.001-0.01 lux 和 0.0001-0.001 lux）内的良好校准的极低光 RAW 图像，以及高质量的 sRGB 参考，从而构成一个名为 See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) 的大型配对数据集，以评估低光 RAW 图像增强方法。此外，还提出了一个基于扩散的框架。

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业场景中的表面缺陷检测至关重要，但由于缺陷类型、不规则形状和大小、细粒度要求以及复杂的材料纹理的广泛可变性，在技术上要求很高。现有方法通常存在特征冗余、细节敏感性有限以及多尺度条件下鲁棒性较弱的问题。

Method: YOLO-FDA，一种基于YOLO的新型检测框架，集成了细粒度细节增强和注意力引导的特征融合。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA在各种缺陷类型和尺度上的准确性和鲁棒性均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

TL;DR: Video-X^2L通过双层KV压缩和选择性KV重载，在长视频理解任务中实现了优于现有KV压缩方法的效果，并节省了计算成本，且无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在长视频理解（LVU）方面面临严峻挑战，这主要是由于计算成本过高。最近的方法探索了KV压缩来缓解这个问题，但它们通常在高压缩率下会遭受严重的信息丢失。

Method: 双层KV压缩和选择性KV重载

Result: Video-X^2L优于现有的KV压缩方法，同时显著节省了计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L在各种流行的LVU基准测试中优于现有的KV压缩方法，同时显著节省了计算成本。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏注释的 HSI 数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并且能够有效检测 OOD 像素，同时不影响 ID 像素的分割性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark，一个用于 Infinity 的鲁棒的按位水印框架，它通过在 token 流的比特级别嵌入水印来防止模型崩溃，同时保持视觉保真度和生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像 Infinity 这样的先进的文本到图像模型以空前的速度生成逼真的图像。然而，它们令人印象深刻的生成能力带来了一个日益增长的风险：随着它们的输出越来越多地出现在互联网上，它们很可能被抓取并重新用作训练数据——可能被完全相同的模型抓取。这种现象已经表明会导致模型崩溃，在这种情况下，重复训练生成的内容，特别是来自模型自身先前版本的内容，会导致性能逐渐下降。

Method: 我们的方法在 Infinity 的图像生成过程中，直接在跨多个尺度（也称为分辨率）的 token 流的比特级别嵌入水印。

Result: 我们的按位水印巧妙地影响了这些位，以保持视觉保真度和生成速度，同时对各种移除技术保持稳健性。此外，它还表现出很高的放射性，也就是说，当带有水印的生成图像被用于训练另一个图像生成模型时，第二个模型的输出也将带有水印。即使仅在带有我们的 BitMark 水印的图像上微调扩散或图像自回归模型，放射性痕迹仍然可以检测到。

Conclusion: 该方法为防止图像生成模型中的模型崩溃提供了一个 принципиальный 的步骤，因为它能够可靠地检测生成的输出。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images often suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail.

Method: The authors train three different Gaussian branches initialized from geometry prior, perception prior and Gaussian noise, refine 3D Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception priors, and enhance the refinement by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates a method that achieves higher-fidelity reconstruction results, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, leading to robust and consistent 3D object generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种拓扑感知建模（TAM）框架，用于解决Sim2Real域适应问题，该框架利用全局空间拓扑和自监督学习来提高点云分类器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从3D对象形状的点集学习语义表示通常受到显着的几何变化的挑战，这主要是由于数据采集方法的差异。通常，训练数据是使用点模拟器生成的，而测试数据是使用不同的3D传感器收集的，从而导致模拟到现实（Sim2Real）的域差距，这限制了点分类器的泛化能力。当前的无监督域适应（UDA）技术难以解决此差距，因为它们通常缺乏能够捕获全局拓扑信息的强大、域不敏感的描述符，从而导致过度拟合到源域的有限语义模式。

Method: 利用全局空间拓扑（以低级、高频3D结构为特征），并通过一种新颖的自监督学习任务对局部几何特征的拓扑关系进行建模。此外，提出了一种先进的自训练策略，该策略将跨域对比学习与自训练相结合，有效减少了噪声伪标签的影响，并增强了适应过程的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个公共Sim2Real基准测试上的实验结果验证了我们的TAM框架的有效性，在所有评估任务中均显示出优于最新方法的持续改进。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的拓扑感知建模（TAM）框架，用于对象点云上的Sim2Real UDA，并在三个公共Sim2Real基准测试上验证了其有效性，在所有评估任务中均显示出优于最新方法的持续改进。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Motivation: 机器人辅助手术中的手术流程分析至关重要，但此类手术的持续时间较长，对全面的视频分析提出了重大挑战。最近的方法主要依赖于 Transformer 模型；然而，它们的二次注意力机制限制了对手术视频的高效处理。

Conclusion: 该方法在三个手术数据集上超越了当前最先进的方法，性能提升显著（在 Cholec80 上 +2.8%，在 MICCAI2016 上 +4.3%，在 Heichole 数据集上 +12.9%）。

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available
after paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 该研究引入了时间推理能力到现有的3DVG模型，并在SG3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

TL;DR: propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS) to  achieve state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal matching

Method: Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces local selection with global optimization

Result: Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method

Conclusion: achieving state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的源自由全景图像分割方法，在遮挡场景下表现良好，且无需访问源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像处理对于全方位上下文感知至关重要，但面临着诸如失真、透视遮挡和有限的注释等约束。以前的无监督领域自适应方法将知识从标记的针孔数据转移到未标记的全景图像，但它们需要访问源针孔数据。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一个更实际的任务，即源自由遮挡感知无缝分割 (SFOASS)。

Method: UNLOCK 包含两个关键模块：全方位伪标签学习和非模态驱动的上下文学习。

Result: 该方法在 mAAP 中获得了 10.9 的最先进分数，在 mAP 中获得了 11.6 的最先进分数，并且相对于仅使用源数据的方法，在 mAPQ 中实现了 +4.3 的绝对改进。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context Knowledge (UNLOCK) 的源自由遮挡感知无缝分割 (SFOASS) 的解决方案，并在真实到真实和合成到真实的适应设置中对提出的 SFOASS 任务进行了基准测试。实验结果表明，该方法取得了与源依赖方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

*Shadman Sobhan,Kazi Abrar Mahmud,Abduz Zami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt是一个统一的框架，它结合了LLM和模块化CNN，用于可扩展的、prompt驱动的医学影像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的医学图像分析系统通常是特定于任务的，需要单独的模型进行分类和分割，并且缺乏支持用户定义的工作流程的灵活性。

Method: 结合了一个用于高级任务规划的few-shot prompted Large Language Model (Llama-4-17B) 和一个用于低级图像处理的模块化卷积神经网络 (DeepFusionLab)。LLM解释用户指令并生成结构化输出，以动态路由特定于任务的预训练权重。

Result: 在涵盖5种成像模式的12个任务的19个公共数据集上评估了MedPrompt。该系统在解释和执行prompt驱动的指令方面实现了97%的端到端正确率，平均推理延迟为2.5秒，适用于近实时应用。DeepFusionLab实现了有竞争力的分割精度（例如，肺部的Dice为0.9856）和强大的分类性能（结核病的F1为0.9744）。

Conclusion: MedPrompt通过结合LLM的可解释性和模块化CNN的效率，实现了可扩展的、prompt驱动的医学影像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

Motivation: 现有的免训练开放词汇语义分割（OVS）方法受限于依赖模型的能力或参考集质量不佳。该研究着眼于数据质量问题，发现高质量的参考集可以显著提升免训练OVS的效果。

Method: 该方法包含一个数据管道，用于构建具有良好配对的分割-文本嵌入的参考集，以及一个简单的基于相似性的检索。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的大量评估表明，该方法优于所有现有的免训练OVS方法。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，高质量的参考集可以显著提升免训练开放词汇语义分割（OVS）的效果，并提出了一个面向数据质量的框架，通过构建具有良好配对的分割-文本嵌入的参考集和简单的基于相似性的检索来实现。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

TL;DR: DiMPLe is introduced to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and language modalities in multi-modal learning. It demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations in visual data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe aims to address this.

Method: DiMPLe disentangles features within and across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization, and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features.

Result: DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents struggle with contextual privacy in collaborative tasks, often leaking private information despite instructions. A new benchmark, MAGPIE, reveals limitations in current models like GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy is critical in multi-agent systems where LLM-based agents collaborate on tasks requiring access to proprietary tools and domain-specific databases. Existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating contextual privacy in complex, multi-turn conversations.

Method: The paper introduces a new benchmark, MAGPIE, comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains to evaluate contextual privacy in LLMs. The state-of-the-art LLMs are evaluated on their understanding of contextually private data and their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy.

Result: Current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, misclassify private data as shareable 25.2% and 43.6% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9% and 50.5% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71% of scenarios.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robust understanding of contextual privacy and fail to preserve user privacy in collaborative tasks, even with explicit instructions.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs primarily perform shallow causal reasoning. The paper introduces CausalProbe-2024 to demonstrate this and proposes G^2-Reasoner to enhance LLMs' causal reasoning towards human-like level-2 reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning.

Method: We delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.  We introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes.

Result: The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

Conclusion: This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型 (LVLMs) 在具身规划任务中表现出潜力，但在涉及不熟悉的环境和多步骤目标的复杂场景中表现不佳。现有的方法依赖于环境无关的模仿学习，将指令与环境背景分离，导致模型难以处理上下文相关的指令，并在长时程交互过程中依赖补充线索而不是视觉推理。

Method: 提出了World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP) 框架，通过视觉外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和句法接地四种认知能力，增强LVLMs的环境理解能力，并使用 curriculum learning 进行模型开发和评估。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试中，Qwen2.5-VL在任务成功率上取得了60.7的绝对提升，尤其是在常识推理（+60.0）和长时程规划（+70.0）方面。增强后的开源模型优于GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet等专有系统。

Conclusion: 该研究通过WAP框架，提升了LVLMs在复杂环境和多步骤目标任务中的表现，显著优于现有方法，甚至超过了GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet等专有系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

TL;DR: AI-driven science needs better reasoning and real-world interaction, requiring human input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are limited by operational architectures, brittle reasoning, and separation from experimental reality, hindering transformative scientific discovery.

Method: Defines active inference AI systems with research memories, symbolic planners, knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulators and automated laboratories.

Result: Outlines an architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models for counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds hypotheses in reality.

Conclusion: AI-driven scientific discovery requires closing abstraction, reasoning, and reality gaps, necessitating human judgment as a permanent component.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [123] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic MoCE architecture, addresses the challenges of understanding tables in real-world contexts by using Neuro-Symbolic Routing and a new dataset, TableMoE-Align. It outperforms existing models on WildStruct benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with WildStruct conditions in real-world tables, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization.

Method: propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture with an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism

Result: TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment.

Conclusion: TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models and demonstrates enhanced robustness and interpretability through neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在理解不可见空间方面存在差距。通过“map-then-reason”方法，构建认知地图并进行推理，可以显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型 (VLM) 无法像人类一样仅从几个视图想象完整的场景。人类形成空间心理模型，即看不见的空间的内部表征，以推理布局、透视和运动。MindCube 基准测试揭示了这一关键差距，现有 VLM 的性能接近随机水平。

Method: 提出了一个“map-then-reason”的协同方法，该方法联合训练模型以首先生成认知地图，然后在认知地图上进行推理。还探索了三种方法来帮助 VLM 逼近空间心理模型，包括未见过的中间视图、自然语言推理链和认知地图。

Result: 通过训练模型对这些内部地图进行推理，准确率从 37.8% 提高到 60.8%（+23.0%）。添加强化学习使性能进一步提高到 70.7%（+32.9%）。

Conclusion: 通过构建和利用内部结构化空间表征以及灵活的推理过程，可以显著提高对不可观察空间的理解。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial but challenging. Hanabi is an ideal testbed, but human evaluation is difficult.

Method: The paper develops human proxy agents on a large-scale human dataset to serve as evaluation partners. A dataset of 3,079 games is open-sourced.

Result: Baseline results for two- and three-player Hanabi scenarios are presented. The proxy agents are hosted through a controlled evaluation system.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) and human proxy agents for evaluating human-AI coordination in Hanabi. Baseline results are presented, and a controlled evaluation system is used.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

TL;DR: Introduce Mind2Web 2, a benchmark for agentic search systems, and propose an Agent-as-a-Judge framework to evaluate time-varying and complex answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search horizons and static answers.

Method: introduce Mind2Web 2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating time-varying and complex answers, propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness and source attribution.

Result: The best-performing system, OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while spending half the time, showing a great potential.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next generation of agentic search systems.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

Motivation: 现有模型在对话安全、详细场景处理和轻量级部署方面存在不足。

Method: 基于InternLM2.5-7B-chat，采用两阶段训练策略（混合蒸馏数据微调和ORPO偏好优化），并设计了创新的条件RAG。

Result: PsyLite在CEval、CPsyCounE和SafeDialBench上优于基线模型，CPsyCounE评分提高47.6%，对话安全评分提高2.4%，且仅需5GB内存即可运行。

Conclusion: PsyLite在心理咨询专业性和对话安全性方面优于基线模型，并通过量化技术实现了低硬件部署。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing multimodal recommender systems for the movie domain is challenging due to limited metadata.

Method: Combines LLM-generated plot descriptions with trailer-derived visual embeddings in a unified pipeline supporting both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and collaborative filtering; uses data augmentation to transform sparse metadata into richer textual signals, alongside fusion strategies (e.g., PCA, CCA) that integrate visual cues.

Result: CCA-based fusion significantly boosts recall compared to unimodal baselines, while an LLM-driven re-ranking step further improves NDCG.

Conclusion: CCA-based fusion and LLM-driven re-ranking significantly improves recommendation performance, especially in scenarios with limited textual data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing multimodal recommender
systems for the movie domain, where limited metadata (e.g., title, genre) often
hinders the generation of robust recommendations. We introduce a resource that
combines LLM-generated plot descriptions with trailer-derived visual embeddings
in a unified pipeline supporting both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
collaborative filtering. Central to our approach is a data augmentation step
that transforms sparse metadata into richer textual signals, alongside fusion
strategies (e.g., PCA, CCA) that integrate visual cues. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that CCA-based fusion significantly boosts recall
compared to unimodal baselines, while an LLM-driven re-ranking step further
improves NDCG, particularly in scenarios with limited textual data. By
releasing this framework, we invite further exploration of multi-modal
recommendation techniques tailored to cold-start, novelty-focused, and
domain-specific settings. All code, data, and detailed documentation are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing approaches focus on simplified versions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct challenges associated with processing complete documents

Method: a specialised IR system tailored for real-world applications

Result: Preliminary experiments were conducted to substantiate these challenges and identify potential solutions

Conclusion: This paper examines the limitations of current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking aims to determine the veracity of scientific claims
by retrieving and analysing evidence from research literature. The problem is
inherently more complex than general fact-checking since it must accommodate
the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, the structural complexity of
academic literature and the challenges posed by long-form, multimodal
scientific expression. However, existing approaches focus on simplified
versions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts
rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct challenges associated
with processing complete documents. This paper examines the limitations of
current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential
features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It
identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval, including (1)
evidence-driven retrieval that addresses semantic limitations and topic
imbalance (2) time-aware evidence retrieval with citation tracking to mitigate
outdated information, (3) structured document parsing to leverage long-range
context, (4) handling complex scientific expressions, including tables,
figures, and domain-specific terminology and (5) assessing the credibility of
scientific literature. Preliminary experiments were conducted to substantiate
these challenges and identify potential solutions. This perspective paper aims
to advance scientific fact-checking with a specialised IR system tailored for

Motivation: 现有的CLTR方法假设一个单一的排序策略，从整个文档候选集中选择前K个排序。在现实世界的应用中，候选文档集有数百万个，使得单阶段排序策略不切实际。现有的双阶段离线排序系统的CLTR方法只考虑了top-1排序设置，并且只关注训练候选生成器，而排序器是固定的。现有的文献中缺少一种用于联合训练排序器和候选生成器的CLTR方法。

Method: 提出了一个新的联合优化方法来分别训练候选策略和排序策略。

Result: 在半合成基准上的实验结果证明了所提出的联合CLTR方法优于基线方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了一个两阶段的CLTR估计器和学习方法，用于训练候选策略和排序策略。实验结果表明，所提出的联合CLTR方法优于基线方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) aims to learn a ranking policy from
user interactions while correcting for the inherent biases in interaction data,
such as position bias. Existing CLTR methods assume a single ranking policy
that selects top-K ranking from the entire document candidate set. In
real-world applications, the candidate document set is on the order of
millions, making a single-stage ranking policy impractical. In order to scale
to millions of documents, real-world ranking systems are designed in a
two-stage fashion, with a candidate generator followed by a ranker. The
existing CLTR method for a two-stage offline ranking system only considers the
top-1 ranking set-up and only focuses on training the candidate generator, with
the ranker fixed. A CLTR method for training both the ranker and candidate
generator jointly is missing from the existing literature. In this paper, we
propose a two-stage CLTR estimator that considers the interaction between the
two stages and estimates the joint value of the two policies offline. In
addition, we propose a novel joint optimization method to train the candidate
and ranker policies, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to propose a CLTR estimator and learning method for two-stage ranking.
Experimental results on a semi-synthetic benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed joint CLTR method over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的检索增强生成（Graph-RAG）方法通常假设一个静态语料库，每当有新文档到达时，都需要昂贵的完整图重建，从而限制了它们在动态、不断发展的环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 利用基于超平面的局部敏感哈希（LSH）将原始语料库划分并组织成层次图结构，从而能够高效且局部地插入新数据，而不会破坏现有拓扑。

Result: EraRag在大型基准测试中实现了比现有Graph-RAG系统高达一个数量级的更新时间和token消耗减少，同时提供了卓越的准确性表现。

Conclusion: EraRag大幅减少了更新时间和token消耗，同时提供了卓越的准确性表现。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: Conformal-RAG improves RAG reliability with statistical guarantees on sub-claim quality, without needing ground truth answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG research overlooks sub-claim quality and lacks probabilistic guarantees or requires ground truth answers.

Method: Conformal-RAG, a framework leveraging conformal prediction (CP) and internal RAG information.

Result: Conformal-RAG retains up to 60% more high-quality sub-claims compared to direct CP applications, while maintaining the same reliability guarantee.

Conclusion: Conformal-RAG provides statistical guarantees on response quality, ensures group-conditional coverage without manual labeling, and retains more high-quality sub-claims compared to direct CP applications on LLMs.

Abstract: Existing research on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) primarily focuses
on improving overall question-answering accuracy, often overlooking the quality
of sub-claims within generated responses. Recent methods that attempt to
improve RAG trustworthiness, such as through auto-evaluation metrics, lack
probabilistic guarantees or require ground truth answers. To address these
limitations, we propose Conformal-RAG, a novel framework inspired by recent
applications of conformal prediction (CP) on large language models (LLMs).
Conformal-RAG leverages CP and internal information from the RAG mechanism to
offer statistical guarantees on response quality. It ensures group-conditional
coverage spanning multiple sub-domains without requiring manual labelling of
conformal sets, making it suitable for complex RAG applications. Compared to
existing RAG auto-evaluation methods, Conformal-RAG offers statistical
guarantees on the quality of refined sub-claims, ensuring response reliability
without the need for ground truth answers. Additionally, our experiments
demonstrate that by leveraging information from the RAG system, Conformal-RAG
retains up to 60\% more high-quality sub-claims from the response compared to
direct applications of CP to LLMs, while maintaining the same reliability
guarantee.

TL;DR: 推荐系统根据用户行为推荐项目，但未能理解用户偏好的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，用户总是通过多个方面与项目进行交互，例如通过隐式二元反馈（例如，点击、不喜欢、长观看）和显式反馈（例如，评论、评论）。 现代推荐系统 (RecSys) 从这些隐式反馈信号中学习用户-项目协作信号，作为大规模二元数据流，随后根据用户个性化的历史交互推荐其他高度相似的项目。 然而，从这种协作连接的角度来看，RecSys 并不关注项目本身的实际内容，而是优先考虑项目中行为共现的较高概率信号。

Method: 一些工作试图利用基于内容的评论来捕获语义知识，以增强推荐模型。 然而，这些方法大多侧重于预测评论的评级，但没有提供人类可以理解的解释。

Result: 推荐系统没有侧重于项目本身的实际内容，而是优先考虑项目中行为共现的较高概率信号。因此，在这种二元学习模式下，推荐系统难以理解用户喜欢或不喜欢某些项目的原因。

Conclusion: RecSys 无法理解用户喜欢或不喜欢某些项目的根本原因。

Abstract: In real-world applications, users always interact with items in multiple
aspects, such as through implicit binary feedback (e.g., clicks, dislikes, long
views) and explicit feedback (e.g., comments, reviews). Modern recommendation
systems (RecSys) learn user-item collaborative signals from these implicit
feedback signals as a large-scale binary data-streaming, subsequently
recommending other highly similar items based on users' personalized historical
interactions. However, from this collaborative-connection perspective, the
RecSys does not focus on the actual content of the items themselves but instead
prioritizes higher-probability signals of behavioral co-occurrence among items.
Consequently, under this binary learning paradigm, the RecSys struggles to
understand why a user likes or dislikes certain items. To alleviate it, some
works attempt to utilize the content-based reviews to capture the semantic
knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, most of these methods focus
on predicting the ratings of reviews, but do not provide a human-understandable
explanation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

TL;DR: E-ABIN is a general-purpose, explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks, combining machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to gene anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible graphical interfaces.

Method: E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, integrating algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders (GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs).

Result: E-ABIN ensures a high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability, demonstrated through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease.

Conclusion: E-ABIN uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive structure-specificity alignment using Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: inference under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with low-entropy, structured content.

Method: a layered computational framework that derives operational principles from this foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four hierarchical layers of operational principles

Result: We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of CCUP-aligned inference.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$\star$) to improve the alignment of diffusion models with less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation and inefficient use of compute.

Method: Introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation.

Result: On MNIST and CIFAR-10, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute.

Conclusion: Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) produces asymptotically exact samples and Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$\star$) performs a global search for high reward samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

*Kin Kwan Leung,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper bridges the gap in the theoretical underpinnings of FLIPD by formally proving its correctness under realistic assumptions. It also shows that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models (DMs) have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID).

Method: linking the LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise

Result: FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds.

Conclusion: We formally prove the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Conclusion: step-wise symbolic verification is effective for tackling complex scientific problems

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

### [143] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: fine-tuned language models extract and recall relation information learned during finetuning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization approaches are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information.

Method: dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained language models

Result: the recall pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

Conclusion: fine-tuned language models extract relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and recall this information in later layers while generating predictions. In some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned information while, in other cases, a single enrichment or recall pathway alone is sufficient.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了在训练大型语言模型时使用低精度格式的挑战，发现不稳定性，并提出了稳定策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型是一个昂贵的、受计算限制的过程，必须随着模型规模的扩大、算法的改进和新数据的收集而重复进行。为了解决这个问题，下一代硬件加速器越来越多地支持较低精度的算术格式，例如NVIDIA Blackwell架构中引入的Microscaling (MX)格式。

Method: 通过在较小的代理模型上进行受控实验和消融研究，研究了块缩放精度格式在模型训练中的挑战和可行性。

Result: 在从头开始训练的近1000个语言模型中，MX格式的训练在损失中表现出明显的、随机的不稳定性，尤其是在较大的计算规模下。量化层归一化仿射参数和一小部分激活引入的乘性梯度偏差会触发失控发散。

Conclusion: 通过修改训练中的精度方案，可以避免或延迟不稳定性。某些混合配置可以恢复与全精度训练相当的性能。

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Motivation: Decompose neural networks into simpler parts. Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD) is impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Method: Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD)

Result: SPD is more scalable and robust to hyperparameters than APD. SPD avoids shrinkage and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. A library for running SPD and reproducing experiments is released.

Conclusion: Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) is more scalable and robust than Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD). SPD avoids shrinkage and better identifies ground truth mechanisms. It opens new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability by scaling linear parameter decomposition methods to larger models.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Motivation: 循环神经网络（RNN），特别是LSTM，对于情感分析和短期股票预测等时间序列任务非常有效。然而，它们的计算复杂性对资源受限环境中的实时部署提出了挑战。虽然FPGA为节能AI加速提供了一个有希望的平台，但现有工具主要针对前馈网络，LSTM加速通常需要完全定制的实现。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成学习已被证明可以有效地提高预测性能，但是诸如 bagging、boosting 和动态集成选择 (DES) 等传统方法存在计算成本高和对异构数据分布的适应性有限的问题。

Method: Hellsemble，一种新颖且可解释的二元分类集成框架，该框架在训练和推理过程中利用数据集的复杂性。Hellsemble通过迭代地将来自更简单模型的错误分类实例传递到后续模型，将数据集增量划分为难度圈，从而形成一个专门的基础学习器委员会。每个模型都在越来越具有挑战性的子集上进行训练，而单独的路由器模型学习根据推断的难度将新实例分配给最合适的基础模型。

Conclusion: Hellsemble通过利用实例级别的难度来构建高效且鲁棒的集成系统，为构建高效且鲁棒的集成系统提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Motivation: 分布式 GNN 框架和系统增强了 GNN 的可扩展性并加速了模型训练，但大多数都针对节点分类进行了优化。它们在链接预测方面的性能仍有待探索。本文通过研究当每个worker在其分配的划分 subgraph 上训练 GNN 而无法访问整个图时，性能下降的问题，揭示了用于链接预测的 GNN 的分布式训练。

Conclusion: SpLPG通过图稀疏化有效缓解了性能下降的问题，同时降低了通信成本，在多个公共真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明了SpLPG的有效性，它在很大程度上保持了链接预测的准确性，同时将通信开销降低了高达约 80%。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中的记忆使它们容易受到数据提取攻击。虽然预训练记忆已被广泛研究，但较少的工作探索其在微调中的影响，特别是对于LoRA微调，一种广泛采用的参数有效方法。

Method: 使用基于相似性的记忆指标

Result: 模型规模和数据重复等因素在预训练和完全微调中强烈影响记忆，但在LoRA微调中并不遵循相同的趋势。

Conclusion: LoRA显著降低了记忆风险，同时保持了强大的任务性能。

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) for GPU kernel performance prediction, a novel use case in performance profiling, to address the challenges of understanding, generating, and processing complex data in AI.

Method: The paper uses a model-agnostic, lightweight LLM-based approach to predict key performance metrics directly from kernel code without execution or profiling tools.

Result: Omniwise achieves over 90% of predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and MI300X architectures.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Omniwise, an end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that uses LLMs to predict GPU kernel performance metrics with high accuracy, and provides tools for integrating this prediction into developers' workflows.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has

applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and

inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从训练好的模型中忘记特定类别对于执行用户删除权和减轻有害或有偏差的预测至关重要。完全重新训练成本高昂，并且现有的反学习方法在预测来自未学习类别的样本时，无法复制重新训练模型的行为。

Method: 提出了一种输出重加权的反学习方法 RWFT，该方法是一种轻量级技术，可以从训练好的分类器中删除整个类，而无需完全重新训练。

Result: 通过大量的机器学习反学习的实验，表明该方法与完全重新训练的结果相匹配，并且对 MIA-NN 具有鲁棒性。引入了一种基于预测概率的总变异 (TV) 距离的新指标，以量化残余泄漏，以防止未来的方法容易受到新的攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法在先前工作使用的评估指标和我们在这项工作中提出的新指标中，与完全重新训练的结果相匹配。与最先进的方法相比，我们在先前使用的指标中获得了 2.79% 的提升，在我们新的基于 TV 的指标中，超过了现有最佳方法 111.45%。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Conclusion: 提出了新的多模型在线共形预测算法，该算法通过从二部图中收集反馈来识别每个时间步的有效模型子集，从而降低了计算复杂性并缩小了预测集。使用预测集大小作为反馈，以及模型损失，可以显着提高效率，同时仍满足所需的覆盖率保证。所提出的算法保证了有效的覆盖率并实现了亚线性后悔。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Motivation: 本文研究了平均奖励MDP中的离线强化学习，这从分布偏移和非均匀覆盖的角度提出了更大的挑战，并且从理论角度来看，尚未得到充分的研究。

Method: 该论文引入了一种基于悲观折扣值迭代的算法，该算法通过一种新颖的分位数剪裁技术进行了增强，从而可以使用更清晰的基于经验跨度的惩罚函数。

Result: 该论文获得了仅取决于目标策略的明确保证，特别是偏差跨度和一种新颖的策略命中半径，从而为平均奖励离线RL提供了第一个完全单策略样本复杂度界限。该论文还处理了一般的弱通信MDP，这与先前工作中做出的限制性结构假设形成对比。通过硬实例表明，在论文的条件下进行学习需要超出目标策略的平稳分布的覆盖假设，从而将单策略复杂度度量与先前研究的案例区分开来。该论文还开发了几乎与主要结果相匹配的下限。

Conclusion: 这篇论文为平均奖励离线强化学习提供了理论保证，并开发了第一个完全单策略样本复杂度界限。

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Conclusion: DL-LIME在保真度和任务性能方面优于传统LIME，并为雷达资源管理决策中哪些因素更重要提供了见解。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Conclusion: The multi-agent LLM framework demonstrates competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. It also shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

Motivation: 传统的规则集成依赖于访问精选的、具有表达性和理想的独立输入特征集，以便少量轴对称区域的集成能够很好地描述目标变量。如果没有这些特征，达到足够的准确率需要增加单个规则的数量和复杂性，从而降低模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与当前最佳方法相同的测试风险的同时，有效地构建了规则集成，并在十个基准数据集上显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MSA 算法在多个基准测试、模型和评估指标上始终优于现有的机器卸载算法，表明 MSA 可能是实现更灵活的、能够进行数据擦除的大型语言模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的计算方法在捕获几何特征、保持对称性和泛化新的抗原界面方面存在局限性。这些方法通常无法准确捕获分子相互作用并保持结构完整性。

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SharpZO, a sharpness-aware zeroth-order optimization method for fine-tuning vision language models on edge devices without backpropagation, achieving significant accuracy and convergence speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance.

Method: a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes.

Result: achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Conclusion: SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Conclusion: TRIDENT在11项下游任务中取得了最先进的性能，证明了结合SMILES、文本和分类功能注释对于分子性质预测的价值。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection.

Method: a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with self-activated and sparse rank activation

Result: MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MoRA shows significant effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while mitigating forgetting.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和多样性方面均优于基线方法。此外，与现有方法相比，该方法在高维环境中实现了 15% 的零样本改进。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

TL;DR: Proposes FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework to adapt to multi-source concept drift by distinguishing and handling real, virtual, and label drift, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization.

Method: a dynamic clustered FL framework designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful historical information.

Result: FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework

detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of

Conclusion: This work represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks

introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习中的公平性是一个关键问题，因为本地客户端数据集中的偏差会影响整个联邦系统。跨客户端的异构数据分布可能导致模型对某些客户端比其他客户端更公平。现有的解决方案大多侧重于减轻单一敏感属性的偏差，忽略了不同客户端多样且有时相互冲突的公平性需求。这种有限的视角可能会限制公平性干预对不同客户的有效性。

Conclusion: FeDa4Fair库的引入，以及四个偏差异构数据集和相应的基准的发布，为在受控环境中比较公平性缓解方法提供了可能。还提供了现成的函数来评估这些数据集的公平性结果。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via black-box neural networks.

Method: H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task.

Result: H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions.

Conclusion: H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is available.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

### [177] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态跳过 Transformer 中间层的新架构，但未能在计算效率方面优于密集基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有条件计算是使 Transformer 更有效的流行策略。现有的方法通常针对单个模块（例如，混合专家层）或彼此独立地跳过层。然而，可解释性研究表明，Transformer 的中间层表现出更大的冗余，并且早期层将信息聚合到令牌位置。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的架构，该架构可以动态地从中间向外跳过可变数量的层。特别是，一种学习的门控机制确定是否基于输入绕过对称跨度的中心块，并且一种门控注意力机制阻止后续令牌关注跳过的令牌位置。残差范数通过“三明治”或“perilayernorm”方案控制，门稀疏性通过自适应正则化损失控制。

Result: 我们的方法没有在验证交叉熵和估计 FLOP 之间的权衡方面实现改进。

Conclusion: 在所研究的规模下，与层数较少的密集基线相比，该方法在验证交叉熵和估计 FLOP 之间的权衡方面没有实现改进。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Unlasting模型，利用双重扩散隐式桥解决单细胞扰动数据配对问题，并结合基因调控网络和掩蔽机制提高预测质量，同时引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计各种扰动下的单细胞反应有助于识别关键基因并加强药物筛选，从而显著提高实验效率。然而，单细胞测序是一个破坏性的过程，无法捕获同一细胞在扰动前后的表型。因此，在扰动和非扰动条件下收集的数据本质上是不配对的。现有方法要么试图使用随机抽样强制配对不配对的数据，要么在建模过程中忽略非扰动和扰动细胞之间的内在关系。

Method: 基于双重扩散隐式桥(DDIB)的框架来学习不同数据分布之间的映射

Result: 集成了基因调控网络(GRN)信息，以生物学上有意义的方式传播扰动信号，并进一步结合掩蔽机制来预测沉默基因，从而提高生成谱的质量。此外，同一扰动下的基因表达在不同细胞之间通常差异很大，经常表现出反映内在异质性的双峰分布。为了捕捉到这一点，我们引入了一个更合适的评估指标。

Conclusion: 提出了Unlasting，一种双重条件扩散模型，解决了非配对单细胞扰动数据的问题，并在GRN的指导下加强了模型对扰动的洞察力，以及一个专门的掩蔽模型，旨在通过预测沉默基因来提高生成质量。此外，我们引入了一种生物学上合理的评估指标，可以更好地反映单细胞反应中固有的异质性。

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

TL;DR: 提出了一种反脆弱强化学习框架，通过动态选择多个鲁棒策略来适应更广泛的分布偏移，从而提高无人机在对抗环境中的导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人飞行器 (UAV) 导航自动化程度的提高使其容易受到对抗性攻击，这些攻击通过传感器操纵来利用强化学习 (RL) 中的漏洞。现有的鲁棒强化学习方法主要旨在处理固定扰动，因此其有效性在泛化到与最优价值分布的分布外偏移时受到限制。

Method: 引入了一种基于折扣 Thompson 抽样 (DTS) 的切换机制的反脆弱强化学习框架，通过动态选择多个鲁棒策略来最小化对抗引起的 state-action-value 分布偏移。

Result: 大量的数值模拟验证了所提出的框架在具有多个动态三维障碍以及更强的 projected gradient descent (PGD) 和欺骗攻击的复杂导航环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的反脆弱强化学习框架在复杂导航环境中表现出色，优于传统的鲁棒强化学习方法，实现了更短的导航路径长度和更高的无冲突导航轨迹率。

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的LLM微调方案，该方案仅对复杂数据使用推理，并在使用更少数据的情况下实现了与传统方法相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大型语言模型（LLM）经常通过监督微调（SFT）进行微调，以提高特定领域的性能。通过提取更大模型的思维链可以获得更好的结果，但代价是大量的昂贵调用和更多的数据。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新颖的微调蓝图，该蓝图通过token answer entropy将训练数据分成复杂性类别，并通过SFT和蒸馏来微调大型语言模型。

Result: 该论文提出的流程明显优于标准SFT方法（平均准确率0.55 vs 0.43），并且在使用更少62%的数据的情况下提供了与蒸馏性能相当的性能（两者的平均准确率均为0.55）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种高效的微调方案，该方案仅对熵识别的复杂数据使用推理，并在两个小型开放模型上进行了验证，结果表明该方案明显优于标准SFT方法，并且在使用更少数据的情况下提供了与蒸馏性能相当的性能。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种抗脆弱强化学习框架，用于提高 RL 策略在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，该框架通过 Wassertein 距离最小化来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署在安全关键系统（如动态空域中的无人机导航）中的强化学习 (RL) 策略容易受到观测空间中分布外 (OOD) 对抗攻击。这些攻击会导致分布转移，从而显着降低价值估计，从而导致不安全或次优的决策，从而使现有策略变得脆弱。

Method: 提出了一种抗脆弱强化学习框架，通过模拟攻击者递增地增加观测空间扰动的强度，使 RL 智能体能够适应并在更广泛的 OOD 观测中泛化，并预测以前未见过的攻击。通过迭代专家指导的评论家对齐，使用 Wasserstein 距离最小化跨增量扰动观测来加强这些边界。

Result: 抗脆弱策略始终优于标准和鲁棒强化学习基线，在 PGD 和 GPS 欺骗攻击下，累积奖励提高了 15%，冲突事件减少了 30%。

Conclusion: 抗脆弱策略在无人机动态避障场景中优于标准和鲁棒强化学习基线，在 PGD 和 GPS 欺骗攻击下，累积奖励提高 15%，冲突事件减少 30%。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的范数感知线性注意力机制（NaLaFormer），通过恢复范数引导的动态尖峰和核扰动的范数分布来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力通过将复杂度从序列长度的二次方降低到线性，成为softmax注意力的可行替代方案。为了保留softmax的两个基本属性，非负性和熵减少，当前的工作采用各种线性可分离的核函数与$L1$归一化代替softmax算子。然而，查询范数被线性注意力中的归一化操作忽略，这种退化严重导致熵差距。同时，现有的工作抑制查询和键向量的负值，导致映射后缺少内积交互。

Method: 提出了一种新的范数感知线性注意力机制，用于恢复范数引导的动态尖峰并恢复核扰动的范数分布。具体来说，首先将查询和键矩阵解耦为两个分量：范数和方向，以分别实现范数感知尖峰控制和范数一致性。采用保范映射将角度矩阵的所有元素投影到正值，利用余弦相似性来抑制方向相反的维度。

Result: 数学上揭示了熵减少的程度随softmax归一化中的查询范数而变化，从而激发了查询范数感知核函数以动态控制熵减少。

Conclusion: NaLaFormer在视觉和语言任务上提高了性能，表达能力和效率提升高达4.2%。

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

Motivation: 卷积神经网络难以捕捉长程时间依赖和全局通道间关系，现有的CNN-Transformer混合模型在局部和全局特征融合方面存在不足，且常常忽略显式的通道建模。

Method: 提出了一种双分支卷积Transformer网络DBConformer，用于脑电解码。它集成了时间Conformer和空间Conformer，分别建模长期时间依赖和通道间交互，并通过通道注意力模块细化空间表示。

Result: 在五个运动想象数据集和两个癫痫检测数据集上的大量实验表明，DBConformer始终优于10个具有竞争力的基线模型，参数比高容量脑电Conformer基线模型少八倍以上。可视化结果表明，DBConformer提取的特征在生理上是可解释的，并且与MI中的感觉运动先验对齐。

Conclusion: DBConformer在运动想象和癫痫检测数据集上优于其他模型，且参数更少，特征具有生理可解释性，适用于稳健和可解释的脑电解码。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 MoE 系统存在严重的负载不平衡问题，在训练和推理期间，只有一小部分专家始终处于激活状态，导致模型容量和计算资源的严重未被充分利用。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的路由框架，即潜在原型路由 (LPR)，该框架通过聚类的角度重新审视专家路由，该框架概括了现有方法，同时在不影响下游性能的情况下促进了平衡的专家利用率。

Result: LPR 减少了专家负载的 Gini 系数，提高了最小-最大专家负载比，实现了接近完美的负载平衡。

Conclusion: LPR 通过在多个开源 MoE 模型（包括 DeepSeek-V3、Qwen3-MoE 和 Mixtral）上的大量实验证明，LPR 将专家负载的基尼系数从平均 0.70 降低到 0.035，并将最小-最大专家负载比从 1e-6 提高到 0.70，实现了接近完美的负载平衡。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats in UAV intrusion detection systems, and conventional out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events.

Method: A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework is used to craft stealthy adversarial attacks, and a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is implemented to detect these perturbations.

Result: CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling is crucial for robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) hallucinate incorrect information and are poorly calibrated, making uncertainty quantification important, especially in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: The paper introduces ScalaBL, a scalable Bayesian inference method for large language models (LLMs). It achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while using only ~1000 additional parameters and scaling to the largest Bayesian LLM to date.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

Motivation: 联邦学习 (FL) 可以在不共享本地数据的情况下实现跨去中心化客户端的协作模型训练，但面临数据、计算和通信方面的异构性挑战。现有的联邦提示学习方法仅依赖于文本提示，而忽略了联合标签域分布偏移。

Method: 基于双提示学习和交叉融合的个性化FL框架

Result: 每个客户端维护跨视觉和语言模态的全局和局部提示：全局提示捕获联邦共享的通用知识，而局部提示编码特定于客户端的语义和域特征。同时，交叉融合模块旨在自适应地整合来自不同级别的提示，使模型能够生成与每个客户端的独特数据分布对齐的个性化表示。

Conclusion: pFedDC在各种异构数据集上始终优于最先进的方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art

*Silas Dobler,Florian Lemmerich*

TL;DR: Proposes linearity-based compression, achieving lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size and showing compatibility with importance-based pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To augment already highly optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network.

Method: linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers.

Result: Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful combination of techniques.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for a new type of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural network models.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

*Hampus Gummesson Svensson,Ola Engkvist,Jon Paul Janet,Christian Tyrchan,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了强化学习的多样化小批量选择，并建议使用行列式点过程来完成此任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多实际应用中，评估实例的优劣通常代价高昂且耗时，例如，人工反馈和物理模拟，而不是提出新的实例。特别是在强化学习中，这一点更为重要，因为需要评估与环境的新交互（即新实例），以提供奖励信号以供学习。

Method: 使用行列式点过程进行强化学习的多样化小批量选择。

Result: 我们进行了一项全面的评估，在众多的生成步骤中，通过三个完善的分子生成预言。

Conclusion: 该实验得出结论，该框架可以大大提高解决方案的多样性，同时仍然获得高质量的解决方案。在药物发现中，这种结果可能会更快地满足未满足的药物需求。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

TL;DR: Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation in perpetual voting systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing perpetual voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information, assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm

Method: integration of Artificial Delegates, preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual voting systems

Result: while absenteeism significantly affects fairness, Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness across diverse scenarios

Conclusion: Absenteeism significantly affects fairness, Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on

but hindered by a lack of reliable data. This paper proposes a novel approach
to forecasting obsolescence risk using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with large
language models (LLMs) to address data limitations by leveraging
domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets. Applied to two real-world

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出改进k-means和k-GMM聚类算法的随机种子选择方法，实验效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视k-means聚类和k-GMM的随机种子选择技术。

Method: 本文形式化了随机种子选择的三个关键要素：种子抽样的度量、候选种子的数量和种子选择的度量，并利用lookahead原则和multipass策略设计新的初始化方法。

Result: 实验表明，在最终度量方面，本文方法比经典方法提高了恒定因子，且开销不大。对于k-means，本文方法优于multi-swap策略。实验分析还揭示了k-means的微妙特性，例如初始SSE和最终SSE之间的相关性、迭代种子选择方法中的方差减少现象以及贪婪方法中最终SSE对池大小的敏感性。

Conclusion: 本文提出有效的k-means和k-GMM聚类算法的随机种子选择方法，有望成为标准技术。

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AGTCNet, a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG classification, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems, existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals.

Method: introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG representations.

Result: With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and 2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Conclusion: AGTCNet significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI deployment.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional

deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy

subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynamicBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in storing and processing up-to-the-minute data. It outperforms GPT4o in both document-free and document-assisted scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and processing up-to-the-minute data.

Method: DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability to independently process recent information or leverage contextual enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system adept at managing dynamic information synthesis.

Result: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: The experimental results confirm the efficacy of DynamicBench, with our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为谱拓扑数据分析提供了第一个特征值级别的鲁棒性保证，证明了均匀 Lipschitz 边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持久拉普拉斯算子是矩阵算子，用于跟踪数据across尺度的形状和结构转换，并在生物学、物理学和机器学习中得到广泛应用。它们的特征值是过滤中几何和拓扑特征的简洁描述符。虽然早期工作为这些算子建立了全局代数稳定性，但是当添加一个单纯形（例如顶点、边或三角形）时，单个特征值的精确变化仍然未知。这很重要，因为下游工具（包括热核签名和谱神经网络）直接依赖于这些特征值。

Method: 证明了一个均匀 Lipschitz 边界

Result: 在插入一个单纯形后，每个向上持久的拉普拉斯算子特征值最多变化为该单纯形边界的欧几里德范数的两倍，独立于过滤尺度和复数大小。

Conclusion: 本文证明了均匀 Lipschitz 边界：在插入一个单纯形后，每个向上持久的拉普拉斯算子特征值最多变化为该单纯形边界的欧几里德范数的两倍，独立于过滤尺度和复数大小。该结果为谱拓扑数据分析提供了第一个特征值级别的鲁棒性保证。它保证了谱特征在局部更新下保持稳定，并能够在动态数据设置中实现可靠的误差控制。

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples.

Method: Introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks, and SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs.

Result: Most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. Susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples and example ordering exhibits a recency bias.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have limitations and biases in learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

TL;DR: NANOADAM updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning, is gradient-free, preserves large-magnitude weights, permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is resource-intensive.  Analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in training from scratch.

Method: NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning

Result: NANOADAM offers several practical advantages: first, this criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Conclusion: NANOADAM dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning, permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time costs of tabular foundation models remain high, particularly for larger datasets.

Method: Dynamically evaluate whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder layer and decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise decoder.

Result: Early stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with negligible degradation in predictive performance on 34 small classification tasks and achieves speedups of up to x2.2 on five larger classification tasks.

Conclusion: Early exiting is an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of tabular in-context learning.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular

Motivation: Vision-based scientific foundation models can aggregate images from diverse sources and learn spatio-temporal correlations, but tokenizing and aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by current distributed methods.

Method: The Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach is introduced, compatible with any model-parallel strategy and vision transformer architecture.

Result: Integrated with tensor parallelism and model sharding, D-CHAG achieved up to a 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Conclusion: The D-CHAG approach significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving up to a 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.
