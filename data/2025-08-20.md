### [1] [Fair Play in the Newsroom: Actor-Based Filtering Gender Discrimination in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13169)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于检测和减轻文本语料库中性别歧视的管道，该管道使用参与者级别指标来捕获情感、句法能动性和引用样式中的不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地影响着数字通信，但它们的输出通常反映了源自其训练数据的结构性性别失衡。

Method: 本文提出了一种扩展的参与者级别管道，用于检测和减轻大规模文本语料库中的性别歧视。在先前关于 discourse-aware 公平性分析的基础上，我们引入了新的参与者级别指标，这些指标可以捕获情感、句法能动性和引用样式中的不对称性。该管道支持诊断语料库分析和基于排除的平衡，从而可以构建更公平的语料库。

Result: 我们的结果表明，虽然可以通过过滤和重新平衡来减轻表面上的不对称性，但更微妙的偏见仍然存在，尤其是在情感和框架方面。我们对 1980 年至 2024 年的德国报纸文章的 taz2024full 语料库应用了我们的方法，证明了跨多个语言维度的性别平衡的显着改善。

Conclusion: 通过过滤和重新平衡可以减轻表面上的不对称性，但更微妙的偏见仍然存在，尤其是在情感和框架方面。我们发布工具和报告，以支持在基于话语的公平性审计和公平的语料库构建方面的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估 AI 代理多模态 Web 浏览能力的新基准 MM-BrowseComp，结果表明现有模型在处理多模态内容方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准（如 BrowseComp）主要侧重于文本信息，忽略了多模态内容的普遍性。为了弥合这一差距，我们引入了 MM-BrowseComp。

Method: 提出了一个名为 MM-BrowseComp 的新基准，包含 224 个具有挑战性的、手工制作的问题，专门用于评估代理的多模态检索和推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型在 MM-BrowseComp 上的全面评估表明，即使是像带有工具的 OpenAI o3 这样的顶级模型，也仅达到 29.02% 的准确率。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态能力和原生多模态推理方面表现不佳，即使是像带有工具的 OpenAI o3 这样的顶级模型，在 MM-BrowseComp 上的准确率也仅为 29.02%。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

### [3] [Overcoming Latency Bottlenecks in On-Device Speech Translation: A Cascaded Approach with Alignment-Based Streaming MT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13358)
*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a simultaneous translation approach with efficient ASR/MT integration and beam-search pruning for real-time, on-device speech translation, achieving better latency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating ASR and MT for real-time, on-device streaming speech translation faces challenges in achieving real-time streaming translation.

Method: A simultaneous translation approach balancing translation quality and latency, efficient ASR/MT integration leveraging ASR linguistic cues, and beam-search pruning techniques.

Result: Demonstrated improved latency and quality in on-device bilingual conversational speech translation.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques outperform baselines in latency and quality, narrowing the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems.

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [4] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了LLM中的推理能力如何影响习语检测性能，并检查了模型大小的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用推理模型的最新趋势提高了大型语言模型 (LLM) 在许多涉及逻辑步骤的任务中的性能。一种可能受益于这种框架的语言任务是习语检测，因为必须首先理解潜在的习语表达，然后才能消除其歧义，并作为推理的基础。

Method: 我们评估了一套 DeepSeek-R1 蒸馏模型（参数范围从 1.5B 到 70B），这些模型是具有代表性的开源模型，跨越四个习语检测数据集。

Result: 我们发现推理的影响比预期的要小且变化更大。对于较小的模型，产生思维链 (CoT) 推理可以提高数学调整中间模型的性能，但达不到基本模型的水平，而较大的模型（14B、32B 和 70B）显示出适度的改进。

Conclusion: 较大的模型表现出对习语的良好理解，成功输出了表达式的准确定义，而较小的模型通常无法输出实际含义。因此，我们还尝试在较小模型的提示中提供定义，我们表明这可以在某些情况下提高性能。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

### [5] [Whispering Context: Distilling Syntax and Semantics for Long Speech Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13376)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhances ASR by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper, improving WER, NER, capitalization, and punctuation success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), capitalization, and punctuation.

Method: distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper with token level distillation and representation loss minimization

Result: demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset

Conclusion: This work highlights the value of integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [6] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B, a 14B parameter model, is fine-tuned to be a virtual data analyst, trained on analytical trajectories with reasoning steps and code execution. It outperforms similar models on benchmarks with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a virtual data analyst and graduate-level problem solver.

Method: The model is trained using a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator, a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), and a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to semantic depth.

Result: Datarus exhibits an 'AHA-moment' pattern, sketching hypotheses, revising them, and converging, avoiding circular loops. It achieves up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Conclusion: Datarus surpasses similar size models and reaches the level of larger reasoning models, achieving up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

### [7] [ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-efficient method to improve cultural alignment in LLMs by fine-tuning them on native speakers' word-association norms. The results show significant improvements in cultural understanding and value alignment, even rivaling larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly mediate cross-cultural communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning approaches.

Method: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association norms

Result: SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by 16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20, and attains human-level valence and arousal. Fine-tuned models shift answer distributions toward the target culture, Qwen's Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third.

Conclusion: A few million culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly retraining.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

### [8] [ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514)
*Hongxin Ding,Baixiang Huang,Yue Fang,Weibin Liao,Xinke Jiang,Zheng Li,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed是一种强化学习框架，通过在决策前提出有临床价值的问题，使医学LLM转向主动模式，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学大型语言模型（LLM）在静态医学问题解答中表现出令人印象深刻的能力，但它们主要在被动模式下运行：直接生成答案而不寻求额外信息，这在此类交互式环境中存在不正确诊断的风险。

Method: 强化学习（RL）框架ProMed，它使用Shapley信息增益（SIG）奖励，并通过结合新获取的信息量及其通过Shapley值估计的上下文重要性来量化每个问题的临床效用。它将SIG集成到两阶段训练管道中：(1) SIG引导的模型初始化和 (2) SIG增强的策略优化。

Result: ProMed平均优于现有技术水平的方法6.29%，并且比被动模式提高了54.45%，同时对超出范围的案例具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProMed显著优于现有方法，平均提升6.29%，并且比被动模式提升54.45%，同时对超出范围的案例具有鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [9] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the underrepresentation of Saudi dialects in Arabic LLMs by LoRA-tuning a foundation model on a new Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset. The Dialect-Token model shows significant improvements in dialect control and fidelity compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic dialectal variation.

Method: LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting time.

Result: Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate and reducing MSA leakage; fidelity also improves. Both LoRA variants outperform strong generic instruction models in dialect control and fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing.

Conclusion: The Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from 47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong generic instruction models in dialect control and fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently exhibit.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的泰卢固语评估数据集MATA，用于评估大型语言模型，并分析了它们的性能和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在泰卢固语中的能力。

Method: 提出了一个新的评估数据集MATA，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在泰卢固语中的能力。

Result: 评估了11个开放权重和闭源的LLM，并对它们的性能进行了细粒度的分析。结果表明，LLM在多项选择题中依赖于肤浅的启发式方法，如答案位置和干扰因素模式。比较了LLM作为裁判的评估与人工评估，以评估开放式问题的回答。

Conclusion: 对LLM在低资源语言（泰卢固语）中的可靠性进行了评估，并得出了一些结论，强调了细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性的重要性，并为未来的泰卢固语NLP研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

### [11] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 压缩模型可能不可信，不能直接替代大型模型，需要仔细评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究压缩模型在资源受限环境中部署时，其预测是否与原始大型模型一样可信。现有工作主要关注压缩对准确率的影响，但性能对等并不保证信任等价。

Method: 使用LIME和SHAP测试测量可解释性对齐，使用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图评估校准相似性。

Result: 实验结果表明，压缩模型在可解释性对齐方面较低，校准相似性方面存在显著不匹配，即使模型之间的准确率几乎相同。

Conclusion: 压缩模型在可解释性和校准相似性方面与大型模型存在显著差异，即使准确率相近，也不能作为大型模型的直接替代品。

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 医疗应用中需要仔细选择解码方法，因为它们的影响有时可能超过模型选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）依赖于各种解码策略来生成文本，这些选择会显著影响输出质量。在医疗保健领域，准确性至关重要，解码策略的影响仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究了五项开放式医疗任务中的11种解码策略，包括翻译、总结、问答、对话和图像字幕，评估了具有医学专业和通用LLM的不同规模。

Result: 确定性策略通常优于随机性策略；较大的模型实现了更高的分数，但推理时间更长，并且对解码的鲁棒性没有提高；医疗LLM在五个任务中的两个任务中优于通用LLM，但统计分析表明没有整体性能优势，并且对解码选择的敏感性更高；相关性因任务而异，MAUVE与BERTScore和ROUGE的一致性较弱，并且对解码策略的敏感性更高。

Conclusion: 确定性策略通常优于随机性策略，光束搜索得分最高，而{\eta}和top-k抽样表现最差。医疗LLM在五个任务中的两个任务中优于通用LLM，但统计分析表明没有整体性能优势，并且对解码选择的敏感性更高。相关性因任务而异，MAUVE与BERTScore和ROUGE的一致性较弱，并且对解码策略的敏感性更高。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates gender bias in Speech-LLMs using speaker assignment as an analytic tool. The results show that Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, but demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.


<details>

Motivation: Whether the similarities between text-based LLMs and Speech-LLMs extend to gender bias remains an open question. Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection an explicit bias cue.

Method: evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing its default speaker assignments for textual prompts and construct two datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii) Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations.

Result: Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, but demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.

Conclusion: Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, but demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

*Tomer Ashuach,Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Martin Tutek,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP is a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning in LLMs using SAEs, outperforming prior methods in removing harmful knowledge while preserving other capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while preserving model utility has become paramount as large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Existing SAE-based methods operate at inference time and do not create persistent changes in the model's parameters, which can be bypassed.

Method: A parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). It automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple layers and suppresses their activations.

Result: CRISP outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign concepts.

Conclusion: CRISP is effective in removing harmful knowledge while preserving general and in-domain capabilities, outperforming prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning tasks. It achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

TL;DR: VLMs在越南语多模态考试中表现不佳，人机协作有所帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨主要在英语数据上训练的VLM是否能够处理真实世界的跨语言多模态推理，因为VLMs在英语多模态任务中表现出了卓越的能力，但它们在低资源语言上的性能在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 提出了ViExam，一个包含2,548个多模态问题的基准测试，用于全面评估VLM在多模态越南语考试中的能力。

Result: 最先进的VLMs的平均准确率仅为57.74%，而开源模型的平均准确率为27.70%。大多数VLMs的表现不如普通人类测试者(66.54%)，只有thinking VLM o3 (74.07%)超过了人类的平均水平，但仍远低于人类的最佳表现(99.60%)。使用英语指令进行跨语言提示并不能提高性能，反而会使SOTA VLMs的准确率降低1个百分点。人机协作可以部分提高VLM的性能，提高5个百分点。

Conclusion: VLMs在多模态越南语考试中的表现不如人类，即使是最好的VLM也远低于人类的最佳表现。使用英语指令进行跨语言提示并不能提高性能，而人机协作可以部分提高VLM的性能。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在处理默认推理方面的能力，发现它们在区分可废止推理和演绎推理方面存在困难，并且思维链提示可能会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用语句对语言学家、哲学家、逻辑学家和认知科学家具有特殊的意义，因为它们具有复杂的允许例外的行为，并且对于默认推理、认知和概念获取至关重要。

Method: 评估了 28 个大型语言模型 (LLM) 使用 20 种可废止的推理模式进行推理的能力，这些模式涉及非单调逻辑中常见的泛化（例如，“鸟会飞”、“乌鸦是黑色的”）。

Result: 虽然一些前沿模型可以很好地处理许多默认推理问题，但性能因模型和提示风格而异。对于某些模型，少量样本提示可以适度提高性能，但思维链 (CoT) 提示通常会导致严重的性能下降（在零样本条件下性能高于 75% 的模型中，平均准确率下降 -11.14%，标准差 15.74%，温度为 0）。大多数模型要么难以区分可废止的推理和演绎推理，要么将通用语句误解为普遍陈述。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在默认推理方面既有希望也有局限性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了通过预测语义特征来解释词嵌入的方法，发现高预测精度并不一定意味着词嵌入真正包含了这些语义信息，而可能只是反映了几何相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提高人工智能系统的可解释性至关重要。以往的工作假设从词嵌入中准确预测这些语义特征意味着嵌入包含相应的知识。本文对这一假设提出了挑战。

Method: 通过检验常用方法来解释词嵌入中编码的知识，这些方法通常涉及将嵌入映射到人类可解释的语义特征集合，即特征规范。

Result: 预测精度并不一定代表真实的基于特征的可解释性。这些映射主要反映向量空间内的几何相似性，而不是指示语义属性的真正出现。仅基于预测性能的数据集之间的比较并不能可靠地表明哪个数据集被词嵌入更好地捕获。

Conclusion: 预测精度并不一定代表词嵌入中存在有意义的语义表示，因为这些方法可以成功预测随机信息，结果主要由算法上限决定，而不是词嵌入中有意义的语义表示。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, proposes Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with chain-of-thought rationales, and shows that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue, sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific question answering (QA)

Method: introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading resistance and sycophancy resistance

Result: Systematic evaluations across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出MGT-Prism，一种基于频域的MGT检测方法，以提高领域泛化能力，实验表明其优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器生成文本（MGT）检测器在相同领域内训练和测试时表现良好，但由于不同来源数据之间的领域差异，泛化到未见领域时效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于频域的MGT检测方法MGT-Prism，包含一个低频域滤波模块和一个动态频谱对齐策略。

Result: 在频域中观察到一致的频谱模式，并且在MGT和人类书写文本（HWT）之间幅度存在显著差异。

Conclusion: MGT-Prism在跨三个领域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，其准确率平均超过最先进的基线0.90%，F1 score平均超过0.92%。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在教育中的作用越来越大，但是很少有人关注LLM生成的文本是否类似于儿童语言。

Method: 通过比较LLM生成的文本与德国儿童对图画故事的描述，评估LLM如何复制儿童语言。

Result: LLM生成的文本更长，但词汇丰富度较低，更多地依赖高频词，并且名词的使用较少。少量样本提示在较小程度上增加了儿童和LLM文本之间的相似性，但仍然未能复制词汇和语义模式。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本在词汇丰富度上较低，更多地依赖高频词，并且名词的使用较少。语义向量空间分析显示相似度较低，表明两个语料库在语料库语义层面存在差异。少量样本提示在较小程度上增加了儿童和LLM文本之间的相似性，但仍然未能复制词汇和语义模式。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Motivation: 虽然使用LLM的文档摘要已经增强了对文本信息的访问，但对这些摘要的事实准确性的担忧仍然存在，尤其是在医学领域。追踪摘要的来源证据使用户能够评估其准确性，从而缓解了这种担忧。

Method: 我们提出了一个总结管道，Track-Then-Sum，作为比较的基线方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，在总结之前明确执行句子级别的跟踪可以提高生成准确性，而结合完整的上下文可以进一步提高完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum可以作为可追溯的、基于方面的摘要任务的有效基准。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

Conclusion: AI模型在道德维度上的理解通常排在前25%的人类注释者中，并且比人类产生更少的假阴性，表明它们具有更敏感的道德检测能力。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种提示方法，无需微调即可精确控制 LLM 生成文本的长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制大型语言模型 (LLM) 生成的文本长度仍然具有挑战性：模型经常超过或低于显式长度指令，因为它们无法可靠地保持内部 token 计数。

Method: 提出了一种基于提示的、一次性策略，该策略迫使 LLM 生成所需数量的 tokens，而无需任何微调或迭代采样。该提示附加了倒计时标记和显式计数规则，以便模型“边写边数”。

Result: 在 MT-Bench-LI 上，GPT-4.1 在严格长度限制下的合规性从简单提示下的 30% 以下跃升至使用我们的倒计时提示时的 95% 以上，超过了流行的 draft-then-revise 基线，同时判断答案质量得以保留。

Conclusion: 通过提示工程可以实现精确的长度控制，为基于训练或解码的方法提供了一种轻量级的替代方案。

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

TL;DR: NLG evaluation metrics have limitations and no single metric is perfect. Choose metrics based on the task and improve validation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial, but automatic evaluation metrics (AEM) lack a definitive solution. Studies use different metrics without fully considering the implications.

Method: A thorough examination of existing NLG evaluation metrics' methodologies, strengths, limitations, validation methods, and correlations with human judgment.

Result: Identified challenges: metrics capture specific aspects of text quality, effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent. These challenges persist in LLM-as-a-Judge and RAG evaluation.

Conclusion: The quest for the 'perfect metric' in NLG evaluation is challenged. Metrics should be selected based on task-specific needs, leveraging complementary evaluations. New metrics should focus on enhanced validation methodologies.

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation

TL;DR: 本研究利用BIM和NLP技术，使用CamemBERT和Random Forest从法语建筑技术规范文件中自动提取需求，取得了良好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究探讨了建筑信息模型（BIM）与自然语言处理（NLP）的集成，以自动从建筑行业内非结构化的法语建筑技术规范（BTS）文件中提取需求。

Method: 采用命名实体识别（NER）和关系提取（RE）技术，利用基于transformer的模型CamemBERT，并应用迁移学习与法语语言模型Fr_core_news_lg，两者都在一般领域的法​​语大型语料库上进行了预训练。为了对这些模型进行基准测试，开发了从基于规则到基于深度学习的方法。

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI: A new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' reasoning abilities in multilingual scientific domains, revealing weaknesses in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks face challenges in multilingual scenarios, modality coverage, and fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge points.

Method: We propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark with 1,019 question-answer pairs, 3 evaluation modes, 4 subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology), and 5 languages (Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese). We conducted experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source models.

Result: o4-mini achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, under the Image-only evaluation mode.

Conclusion: MME-SCI is widely challenging for existing MLLMs, and existing models have weaknesses in specific domains.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding factors driving customer review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business performance in the hospitality industry.

Method: Transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Uses graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features to predict review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.

Result: ReviewGraph performs similar to the state-of-the-art model with lower computational cost and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics.

Conclusion: ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines, offering advantages in interpretability and integration into RAG systems. Future work includes integrating graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods.

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Motivation: 长上下文建模对于各种现实世界的任务至关重要，包括长上下文问答、摘要和复杂推理任务。最近的研究探索了使用合成数据对大型语言模型 (LLM) 进行微调，以增强其长上下文能力。然而，此类方法的有效性通常受到生成数据中低多样性和事实不一致的限制。

Method: 利用多臂老虎机 (MAB) rollout 策略，从给定的长上下文中识别出信息量最大的块，用于采样高质量和多样化的响应，并构建用于直接偏好优化 (DPO) 训练的偏好数据对。

Result: LongMab-PO在长上下文推理基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LongMab-PO显著提高了偏好数据对的多样性和质量，并在长上下文推理基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on
https://github.com/NEUIR/LongMab-PO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的RLVR训练策略，通过在线自博弈与变分问题合成来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的RLVR训练会降低策略熵，导致生成多样性降低，并限制了Pass@k的性能。

Method: 在线自博弈与变分问题合成（SvS）策略

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准测试中，Pass@32性能分别提高了18.3%和22.8%。在12个推理基准测试中，从3B到32B的不同模型尺寸上，SvS表现出通用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种在线自博弈与变分问题合成（SvS）策略，用于RLVR训练，该策略有效地保持了训练期间的策略熵，并显着提高了Pass@k。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

TL;DR: 通过在LLM代理的响应中加入前缀，PING提高了LLM代理的安全性，且没有牺牲它们的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）已发展成为能够规划和与外部工具交互以解决复杂任务的代理系统。然而，在微调过程中，安全问题经常被忽视。对LLM在代理特定任务上进行微调以提高其熟练程度，可能导致意外的不对齐，从而导致执行有害任务的可能性更高，并且在微调以执行代理任务时，拒绝它们的倾向降低。

Method: 提出了一种名为PING的方法，该方法将自动生成的自然语言前缀添加到代理响应中，引导它们拒绝有害请求，同时保持良性任务的性能。PING采用迭代方法，交替生成候选前缀并选择优化任务性能和拒绝行为的前缀。

Result: PING在网络导航和代码生成任务的各种基准测试中始终优于现有的提示方法。

Conclusion: PING显著提高了微调LLM代理的安全性，而没有牺牲它们的有效性。线性探针分析表明，前缀令牌对于行为修改至关重要。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字健康分析面临严峻挑战，患者生成健康内容的情感和医学背景复杂，需要稀缺的领域专业知识，而传统的机器学习方法受到医疗保健环境中数据短缺和隐私限制的约束。

Method: 开发了一个结构化的代码本，系统地编码专家解释指南，使LLMs能够通过有针对性的提示应用领域特定知识，而不是进行广泛的训练。

Result: LLMs表现出卓越的性能，并展示了专家级别的协议，与专家间协议水平没有统计学上的显著差异，表明知识整合超越了表面模式识别。

Conclusion: LLMs通过上下文学习整合专家知识，为数字健康分析提供了一个有希望的解决方案，解决了专家知识短缺的关键挑战，并实现了实时的专家级分析。

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Motivation: 确定LLM中允许跨不同任务类别成功进行ICL的精确机制或内部结构仍然难以捉摸。基于物理的任务为探测这一挑战提供了一个有希望的试验台

Method: 使用稀疏自动编码器（SAE）分析模型的残差流激活

Result: 上下文中动态预测的性能随着更长的输入上下文而提高。SAE捕获的特征与关键物理变量（如能量）相关

Conclusion: 有意义的物理概念在上下文学习过程中被编码在LLM中

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

### [36] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR是一种用于疲劳检测的轻量级目标检测模型，它通过CAFM和RCM模块提高了精度和定位准确性，并在DSM数据集上优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理和车辆动力学方法通常具有侵入性、依赖硬件且在实际环境中缺乏鲁棒性。视觉技术虽然提供了一种非侵入性和可扩展的替代方案，但仍然面临着小物体或被遮挡物体检测不佳以及多尺度特征建模有限等挑战。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR，一种轻量级高效的目标检测模型，专为实时疲劳检测而定制。YOLO11-CR引入了两个关键模块：卷积和注意力融合模块（CAFM）和矩形校准模块（RCM）。

Result: 在DSM数据集上的实验表明，YOLO11-CR的精度为87.17%，召回率为83.86%，mAP@50为88.09%，mAP@50-95为55.93%，显著优于基线模型。消融研究进一步验证了CAFM和RCM模块在提高灵敏度和定位精度方面的有效性。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车辆疲劳监测提供了一种实用且高性能的解决方案，具有很强的实际部署潜力，以及未来在时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化方面的增强潜力。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mirage, a benchmark for in-the-wild AIGI detection, and Mirage-R1, a model that outperforms existing detectors by 5-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios due to noise and variations in real-world images.

Method: A vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, trained in two stages (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning) with an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy.

Result: The Mirage benchmark and the Mirage-R1 model achieve state-of-the-art results in detecting in-the-wild AIGI.

Conclusion: The proposed Mirage-R1 model outperforms state-of-the-art detectors by 5% on the Mirage benchmark and 10% on a public benchmark.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1 是一种推理增强框架，旨在通过利用专家模型来提高大型视觉语言模型在 OCR 任务中的性能，减少幻觉并实现更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 中的最新进展使端到端文档图像解析的新范例成为可能，从而擅长于文本、表格和公式识别等光学字符识别 (OCR) 任务。然而，与大型语言模型 (LLM) 类似，生成式 LVLM 容易出现幻觉——生成输入图像中不存在的单词。此外，LVLM 专为通用目的而设计，与在领域特定数据集上训练的专家模型相比，在 OCR 任务上的效果往往较差。

Method: 提出了一种推理增强框架 DianJin-OCR-R1，通过训练推理和工具交错的 VLM 来解决这些限制。

Result: DianJin-OCR-R1 模型始终优于其非推理模型和专家 OCR 模型。

Conclusion: DianJin-OCR-R1 模型在 ReST 和 OmniDocBench 上始终优于其非推理模型和专家 OCR 模型，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully

TL;DR: CLoE是一种用于评估溃疡性结肠炎内窥镜图像疾病严重程度的课程学习框架，它通过考虑标签可靠性和顺序结构，提高了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从内窥镜图像估计疾病严重程度对于评估溃疡性结肠炎至关重要，其中梅奥内窥镜下评分 (MES) 广泛用于对炎症进行分级。然而，由于观察者间变异性和评分的顺序性质，MES 分类仍然具有挑战性，标准模型通常忽略了这一点。

Method: 提出了CLoE，一个课程学习框架，它考虑了标签可靠性和顺序结构。使用图像质量作为注释置信度的代理，并结合ResizeMix增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在 LIMUC 和 HyperKvasir 数据集上的实验表明，CLoE 始终优于强大的监督和自监督基线模型。例如，ConvNeXt-Tiny 在 LIMUC 上以低计算成本达到了 82.5% 的准确率和 0.894 的 QWK。

Conclusion: CLoE在溃疡性结肠炎内窥镜图像的疾病严重程度估计方面表现出潜力，通过考虑标签可靠性和顺序结构，优于现有的监督和自监督基线模型。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter is a diffusion-based framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain. It enables the generation of temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences and can generate novel identities. Synthetic samples improve gait recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait recognition remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving privacy.

Method: GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch, exclusively on gait silhouette data.

Result: Incorporating synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions. Additionally, they introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities by interpolating identity embeddings.

Conclusion: This work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive is a visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving that achieves significant speedups and memory savings with minimal performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of VLMs in autonomous driving is hindered by the significant computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view images.

Method: Proposes Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework with diversity-aware token selection and a view-adaptive pruning controller.

Result: Prune2Drive achieves a 6.40x speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark when retaining only 10% of the visual tokens.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens, the method achieves a 6.40x speedup and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [43] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH is a meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy.

Method: a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods

Result: achieving higher attack success rates and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID

Conclusion: DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks and generalizes well to unseen defenses.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal photographs.

Method: The pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis.

Result: Statistically significant improvements were observed in nasal measurements (alar width to face width ratio, nose length to face height ratio, and alar width to intercanthal ratio) and global facial symmetry or perceived age. Patient identity remains consistent post-operatively. Inter-practitioner variability in improvement rates was analyzed.

Conclusion: The study provides reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a novel dataset, facilitating data-driven surgical planning, patient counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Conclusion: Certain SLMs achieve competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

TL;DR: This paper finds Easy-Options Bias in VQA benchmarks. And introduce GroundAttack to fix this


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks

Method: introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer

Result: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space

Conclusion: current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Conclusion: 有效的知识提炼和结构化的多智能体监督可以使轻量级视觉语言模型捕获复杂的推理能力。VISTA 的紧凑架构有助于在边缘设备上高效部署，无需进行广泛的基础设施升级即可实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++ is a novel framework for controllable talking head generation that enables individual manipulation of facial motions (mouth, pose, eye, expression) based on video or audio inputs, using disentangled latent spaces and learnable bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of the talking head generation. Existing methods often neglect the decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they operate independently without mutual interference and can be preserved to share with different modal inputs.

Method: The framework employs four lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, the authors enforce orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.

Result: Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of EDTalk++.

Conclusion: This paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement framework for controllable talking head generation.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural

complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Motivation: 微表情识别(MER)在许多领域具有重要的应用价值，但微表情(ME)的持续时间短和强度低给MER带来了相当大的挑战。现有的深度学习MER方法主要包括三种数据加载方法：静态图像、动态图像序列以及两者的组合。如何有效提取ME的细粒度和时空特征一直是难以解决的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的FAMNet模型在多个数据集上显著提高了微表情识别任务的性能，尤其在最具挑战性的CAS(ME)$^3$数据集上取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive

Motivation: Multi-view clustering performance can be improved by learning consistency and complementarity, but cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked.

Method: A novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) is proposed, which includes multi-view instance learning, bi-level decoupling of features and clusters, and consistency learning.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to SOTA methods on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed BDCL method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods on five benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing methods often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes

Method: a reinforcement learning-based method that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations

Result: find a better exposure schedule than traditional solutions

Conclusion: achieves the state-of-the-art performance

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis.

Method: Keypoints were extracted from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. A custom multi-object tracking algorithm was incorporated to improve tracking stability and a Transformer-based classifier determines shot occurrences.

Result: The feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton is demonstrated.

Conclusion: Extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton is feasible, broadening analytics capabilities, and this work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

Method: 提出了一种名为视觉高斯量化 (VGQ) 的新框架，通过将 2D 高斯函数集成到传统的视觉码本量化框架中，显式地增强了结构建模。

Result: VGQ在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中实现了强大的重建质量，rFID分数为1.00。通过增加tokens中二维高斯函数的密度，VGQ在重建能力方面获得了显著提升，并实现了最先进的重建rFID分数0.556和PSNR 24.93，大大优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ在图像重建方面显著优于现有方法，在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中实现了最先进的重建rFID分数0.556和PSNR 24.93。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Conclusion: 提出的几何知识引导的分布校准方法有效地克服了由数据异构性和样本不平衡引起的信息不足，并在基准测试中提高了性能。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Method: The paper incorporates two key innovations: RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP), and Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network.

Result: FLAIR outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed FLAIR method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-

innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the

*Farhaan Ebadulla,Chiraag Mudlapur,Gaurav BV*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeProphet 是一种仅使用软件的注视点预测方法，用于VR注视点渲染，无需专用硬件，并且优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法需要昂贵的基于硬件的眼动追踪系统，由于成本、校准复杂性和硬件兼容性限制，限制了广泛采用。本文提出了一种仅使用软件的方法，用于预测VR环境中的注视点位置，而无需专用眼动追踪硬件。

Method: 结合了用于处理360度VR场景的球面视觉Transformer和一个基于LSTM的时间编码器，用于捕获注视点序列模式。一个多模态融合网络将空间场景特征与时间注视点动态结合起来，以预测未来具有相关置信度估计的注视点位置。

Conclusion: 软件注视点预测适用于VR注视点渲染，使得这种性能提升更容易在不同的VR平台和应用程序上实现。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码 (GFVC) 通过利用深度生成模型的强大推理能力来实现卓越的率失真性能。然而，其大量的模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。为了解决这个问题

Method: 提出了一种轻量级 GFVC 框架，该框架引入了双模优化——结合了架构重新设计和操作改进——以降低复杂性，同时保持重建质量。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法能够减少 90.4% 的参数和节省 88.9% 的计算量，同时在感知质量指标方面优于最先进的视频编码标准 VVC。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在参数减少 90.4% 和计算节省 88.9% 的同时，在感知质量指标方面优于最先进的视频编码标准 VVC。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

TL;DR: Propose a Neuron-like Encoding method and an artificial photoreceptor layer to improve SNN performance by generating spike data based on biological neurons, which increases the information content of spike signals while adhering to neuromorphic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs performance lags behind CNNs due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data. Training SNNs with non-spiking inputs deviates from the original intent of neuromorphic computing.

Method: Neuron-like Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete visual spike signal.

Result: increase the information content of spike signals and improves SNN performance

Conclusion: This biologically inspired approach effectively increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader applications of SNNs.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS: Detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining, using normal reference images as visual prompts and dictionary lookup capabilities via self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation (FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes. However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples.

Method: DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) Dictionary Lookup - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination Regularization- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed.

Result: DictAS enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts.

Conclusion: DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods on seven public industrial and medical datasets.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify 通过迭代优化解决逆运动学 (IK) 仍然是一个强大的基线。然而，其高计算成本限制了它的实用性。最近跨领域的进展表明，用数据驱动的神经网络代替迭代优化可以在不牺牲准确性的情况下显着提高运行时。

Method: Learnable SMPLify，一个神经框架，用单程回归模型代替 SMPLify 中的迭代拟合过程。

Result: 我们的方法将自己确立为一个实用且简单的基线：与 SMPLify 相比，它实现了近 200 倍的运行速度，可以很好地推广到看不见的 3DPW 和 RICH，并且在用作 LucidAction 的插件工具时以模型无关的方式运行。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify 速度提高了 200 倍，可以很好地推广到看不见的 3DPW 和 RICH，并且在用作 LucidAction 的插件工具时以模型无关的方式运行。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Motivation: Existing methodologies overlook feature semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, making them unsuitable for high-performance IoT applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The paper proposes a generative attention-based model to learn the relation of feature semantics. The model simultaneously learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature semantics.

Result: The proposed model achieves superior performance on action recognition and action detection tasks, as validated through experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a generative attention-based model that learns the relation of feature semantics by leveraging the differences of actions' foreground and background. The model's effectiveness is validated through experiments on action recognition and action detection tasks, demonstrating its superiority on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Result: significantly improves segmentation quality without introducing complex designs

Conclusion: achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public RVOS benchmarks

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 自动驾驶 (AD) 系统在低照度和降水等不利环境条件下表现出明显降低的性能。AD 数据集中不利条件的代表性不足使得解决这一缺陷具有挑战性。为了规避获取和注释不利天气数据的过高成本。

Method: 提出了一种新的域适应 (DA) 管道，该管道将晴朗天气图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像。系统地开发和评估了几种新的数据生成管道，包括纯模拟、基于 GAN 和混合扩散-GAN 方法，以从标记的晴朗图像合成逼真的不利图像。利用现有的 DA GAN，扩展它以支持辅助输入，并开发一种利用模拟和真实图像的新型训练方法。引入了一种通过将 Stable-Diffusion Image-to-Image (img2img) 输出与它们的原始图像自适应地混合来减轻幻觉和伪影的方法。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 提高计算效率对于SSM在计算机视觉中的实际和可扩展部署至关重要。虽然token减少是提高模型效率的有效方法，但将其应用于SSM需要仔细考虑其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 提出了一种专为基于SSM的视觉模型设计的token合并策略MaMe。该方法利用状态转移参数作为信息量度，并引入战略性的token排列来保持序列信息流。

Conclusion: MaMe在图像分类、视频和音频领域表现出强大的泛化能力，为提高各种SSM应用的效率提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于相机的3D语义场景补全（SSC）方法依赖于耦合的编码器来传递语义和几何先验，这迫使模型在冲突的需求之间进行权衡，并限制了其整体性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为FoundationSSC的新框架，该框架在源和路径级别执行双重解耦。引入了一个基础编码器，为语义分支提供丰富的语义特征先验，为几何分支提供高保真立体成本量。通过专门的、解耦的路径来细化这些先验，从而产生卓越的语义上下文和深度分布。此外，还引入了一种新的轴感知融合（AAF）模块，通过各向异性地将这些特征合并成一个统一的表示来解决融合这些特征的挑战。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上超过了先前的最佳结果，+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU。此外，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上实现了最先进的性能，达到21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在语义和几何指标方面的优势。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: The PersonaVlog framework demonstrates significant advantages and potential for generating automated Vlogs compared to several baselines.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and

collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive

smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

TL;DR: 提出了 TalkVid 数据集，以解决现有 audio-driven talking head synthesis 模型在人种、语言和年龄组泛化能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的模型缺乏对种族、语言和年龄组中人类多样性全 spectrum 的泛化能力。这种泛化差距是现有训练数据局限性的直接体现，这些数据缺乏必要的规模、质量和多样性。

Method: 通过一个有原则的、多阶段的自动化流程来管理 TalkVid，该流程严格过滤运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，并根据人工判断进行验证，以确保其可靠性。构建并发布 TalkVid-Bench，这是一个包含 500 个剪辑的分层评估集，这些剪辑在关键人口和语言轴上经过精心平衡。

Result: 引入 TalkVid，这是一个新的大规模、高质量和多样化的数据集，包含来自 7729 位独特说话者的 1244 小时的视频。模型在 TalkVid 数据集上训练优于在以前的数据集上训练的模型，表现出卓越的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型在 TalkVid 数据集上训练优于在以前的数据集上训练的模型，表现出卓越的跨数据集泛化能力。在 TalkVid-Bench 上的分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的各个亚组之间的性能差异，强调了其对未来研究的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

*Sheng Yu,Di-Hua Zhai,Yuanqing Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New RGB-only method uses a transformer network and geometric features to improve category-level object pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-D methods struggle in scenes lacking depth information, motivating an RGB-only approach.

Method: A transformer-based neural network with a geometric feature-guided algorithm and RANSAC-PnP is used.

Result: The proposed approach achieves highly efficient and accurate category-level object pose estimation on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This RGB-based method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in category-level object pose estimation compared to previous RGB-based methods.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

*Ao Chen,Lihe Ding,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DiffIER，一种基于优化的方法，通过迭代误差最小化来减少推理过程中的累积误差，从而提高生成质量，并在各种生成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量生成样本对指导权重的选择高度敏感。作者发现了一个关键的``训练-推理差距''，并认为正是这种差距破坏了条件生成的性能，并使输出对指导权重高度敏感。

Method: 提出了一种基于优化的DiffIER方法，用于高质量生成。通过在推理的每个步骤中进行迭代误差最小化，可以有效地减少累积误差。

Result: 通过测量推理阶段的累积误差来量化这种差距，并建立指导权重的选择与最小化这种差距之间的相关性。通过引入这种新颖的即插即用优化框架，可以在每个推理步骤优化误差并提高生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，并在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成中取得了一致的成功，强调了其多功能性和未来研究中广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

### [83] [RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle to identify image rotation, especially distinguishing 90{\deg} from 270{\deg}, revealing a gap in spatial reasoning compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the extent to which Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of rotated input images, which demands robust visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduce RotBench, a 350-image benchmark, to evaluate MLLMs' ability to identify image rotation at 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle to reliably identify rotation in input images, with limited improvements from auxiliary information or chain-of-thought prompting. Fine-tuning improves 180{\deg} identification but not 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} distinction.

Conclusion: MLLMs have a significant gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared to human perception in identifying image rotation, particularly distinguishing between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations.

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

TL;DR: OmniTry是一个统一的VTON框架，它可以将VTON扩展到服装以外的任何可穿戴物品，例如珠宝和配饰，并在无掩码设置下进行更实际的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VTON工作主要集中在服装上。本文提出了OmniTry，一个统一的框架，将VTON扩展到服装以外的任何可穿戴物品，例如珠宝和配饰，并在无掩码设置下进行更实际的应用。扩展到各种类型的对象时，数据策展对于获取成对图像（即对象图像和相应的试穿结果）具有挑战性。

Method: 两阶段流程：利用大规模不成对图像训练模型进行无掩码定位；使用成对图像对模型进行微调，以传递对象外观的一致性。

Result: OmniTry在包含12个常见可穿戴对象类别的综合基准上进行了评估，包括店内和野外图像。实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，OmniTry在对象定位和ID保持方面表现更好。

Conclusion: OmniTry在对象定位和ID保持方面表现更好。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at
https://omnitry.github.io/.

### [85] [DeH4R: A Decoupled and Hybrid Method for Road Network Graph Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13669)
*Dengxian Gong,Shunping Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeH4R结合了图生成和图增长的优点，实现了快速、高精度和拓扑保真度的道路网络提取，并在CityScale和SpaceNet数据集上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从遥感图像中自动提取完整而精确的道路网络图仍然是地理空间计算机视觉中的一个关键挑战。基于分割的方法在像素级识别中有效，但在矢量化后处理后难以保持拓扑保真度。图增长方法构建了更多拓扑保真图，但计算量大，迭代ROI裁剪成本高。图生成方法首先预测全局静态候选道路网络顶点，然后推断顶点之间可能的边，实现了快速的拓扑感知推理，但限制了顶点的动态插入。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合模型DeH4R，该模型结合了图生成效率和图增长动态，通过将任务解耦为候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构造和图扩展来实现。

Result: DeH4R优于先前的SOTA图增长方法RNGDet++ 4.62 APLS，在CityScale上IoU优于10.18，同时速度快了大约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，在CityScale上，APLS超过RNGDet++ 4.62，IoU超过10.18，速度快约10倍。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: 提出了HumanPCR评估套件，用于评估多模态模型在以人为中心的视觉理解能力。评估结果表明现有模型在此方面存在显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型的快速发展推动了对通用人工智能的追求，这需要模型在不同环境中达到与人类相当的性能。现有的基准测试经常忽略一些重要的技能。

Method: 提出了HumanPCR，一个用于探测MLLM在人类相关视觉环境中的能力的评估套件，该套件包含三个层级：感知(Human-P)、理解(Human-C)和推理(Human-R)。

Result: 对30多个最先进的模型的广泛评估表明，它们在以人为中心的视觉理解方面存在显著的挑战，特别是在从不同的人类场景中提取重要的前瞻性视觉证据以及它们对查询引导的检索的错误依赖方面。即使是像缩放视觉环境和测试时思考这样的先进技术也只能产生有限的好处。

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估结果表明，现有模型在以人为中心的视觉理解方面面临重大挑战，尤其是在涉及详细的空间感知、时间理解和心智建模的任务中。即使采用先进的技术，效果也有限。

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

*Shumeng Li,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Luping Zhou,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCMamba是一种用于半监督医学图像分割的新框架，它利用数据、网络和特征的多样性，优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取用于医学图像分割的高质量注释数据非常繁琐且成本高昂。 半监督分割技术通过利用未标记数据来生成伪标签来减轻这种负担。 最近，以Mamba为代表的先进状态空间模型已经展示出处理远程依赖关系的能力。 这促使我们探索它们在半监督医学图像分割中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba框架(DCMamba)，用于半监督医学图像分割，该框架从数据、网络和特征的角度探索和利用多样性。 首先，从数据角度来看，我们开发了具有Mamba扫描建模特征的patch-level弱-强混合增强。 此外，从网络角度来看，我们引入了一个多样性扫描协作模块，该模块可以受益于来自不同扫描方向的预测差异。 此外，从特征的角度来看，我们采用了一种不确定性加权对比学习机制来增强特征表示的多样性。

Result: DCMamba在Synapse数据集上使用20%的标记数据，其性能比最新的基于SSM的方法高出6.69%。

Conclusion: DCMamba在半监督医学图像分割方面显著优于其他方法，例如，在Synapse数据集上使用20%的标记数据，其性能比最新的基于SSM的方法高出6.69%。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Searching for relevant Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a challenging task. Existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models.

Method: A hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using natural language queries.

Result: A new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions.

Conclusion: A hierarchical vision-language model is proposed and achieves up to about 62% R@1 and 78% MRR, confirming its effectiveness. It also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6% R@1 and 11% MRR.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IPGA，一种利用投影模块中间阶段进行攻击的方法，可以更精确地控制对抗扰动，并在多个商业VLM上成功转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法扰乱图像以最大化与目标文本或参考图像的全局相似性，将丰富的视觉语义折叠成单个全局向量。这限制了攻击粒度，阻碍了细粒度的操作，例如修改汽车同时保留其背景。此外，这些方法在很大程度上忽略了投影模块，这是VLM中视觉编码器和语言模型之间的关键语义桥梁，从而未能破坏VLM中的完整视觉-语言对齐管道，并限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出中间投影引导攻击（IPGA），这是一种利用投影模块中间阶段进行攻击的方法，特别是广泛采用的Q-Former，它将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度的视觉特征。此外，提出了残差查询对齐（RQA）来保留不相关的视觉内容。

Result: IPGA在标准全局图像字幕任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中，始终优于现有方法。此外，IPGA成功转移到多个商业VLM，包括Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT。

Conclusion: IPGA在黑盒环境下，在标准全局图像字幕任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中，始终优于现有方法。此外，IPGA成功转移到多个商业VLM，包括Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage in LVLMs, improving multi-image reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs due to cross-image information leakage.

Method: FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. It sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. This process is repeated across all target images, and the resulting logits are aggregated and contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input.

Result: FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families.

Conclusion: FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families, offering a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Motivation: 现有的6D姿态估计数据集主要关注小型家用物品，限制了它们在移动机器人领域的应用。移动平台通常在没有机械臂的情况下运行，与更大的物体交互，并面临远距离感知、严重的自遮挡和不同的相机视角等挑战。

Method: 提出了一个新的数据集MR6D，专为工业环境中移动机器人的6D姿态估计而设计。该数据集包含92个真实场景，具有16个独特的对象，涵盖静态和动态交互。

Result: MR6D数据集包含92个真实场景，具有16个独特的对象，涵盖静态和动态交互。MR6D捕捉了移动平台的特定挑战，包括远距离视角、不同的对象配置、更大的对象尺寸和复杂的遮挡/自遮挡模式。

Conclusion: MR6D数据集的初步实验表明，当前的6D姿态估计流程在移动机器人环境中表现不佳，2D分割是另一个障碍。MR6D为开发和评估针对移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

### [92] [Shape-from-Template with Generalised Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13791)
*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents a new multi-camera Shape-from-Template method with improved reconstruction accuracy, validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Shape-from-Template (SfT) to multi-camera setups opens new directions for use-cases like 3D shape registration in medical imaging and registration from hand-held cameras.

Method: The paper proposes multiple approaches for SfT with generalised cameras, including correspondence-based approaches solved with convex programming and a silhouette-based approach with iterative refinement.

Result: The accuracy of the proposed methods is demonstrated on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: This paper introduces the first set of solutions to the Shape-from-Template (SfT) problem with generalised cameras, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy by utilising mutual constraints between multiple views of a deformed object.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

### [93] [VisionLaw: Inferring Interpretable Intrinsic Dynamics from Visual Observations via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13792)
*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw uses a bilevel optimization framework with LLMs to infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inferring intrinsic dynamics from visual observations rely on manual priors or neural networks, leading to limited generalization and interpretability.

Method: A bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations, featuring an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy and a vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism.

Result: VisionLaw significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.

Conclusion: VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations, outperforming existing methods and generalizing well to novel scenarios.

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Agents (CoA) is introduced as a novel LLM reasoning paradigm for end-to-end complex problem-solving, outperforming existing multi-agent systems. The research, including models, code, and data, is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems rely on manual prompt/workflow engineering, making them inefficient and less capable and unable to benefit from data-centric learning.

Method: A multi-agent distillation framework is used to distill multi-agent systems into chain-of-agents trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, followed by agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks.

Result: AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings.

Conclusion: Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on web agent and code agent benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [95] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace is a new approach to LLM context management that mimics human memory, improving memory reuse and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face fundamental limitations in context management despite advances in extending context windows. Current passive retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human memory management.

Method: The paper introduces Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that emulates human cognitive mechanisms of external memory use, featuring active memory management, hierarchical cognitive buffers, and task-driven context optimization.

Result: Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18% net efficiency gain. Statistical analysis confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23.

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation in LLMs, supported by empirical evidence and a comprehensive theoretical framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

### [96] [AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174)
*Hongjun Ding,Binqi Chen,Jinsheng Huang,Taian Guo,Zhengyang Mao,Guoyi Shao,Lutong Zou,Luchen Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AlphaEval, an open-source, backtest-free framework for evaluating alpha mining models, addressing limitations of existing methods like backtesting and correlation-based metrics. It assesses alphas across five dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness, financial logic, and diversity, demonstrating comparable consistency to backtesting with improved insights and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders reproducibility and slows progress in this field.

Method: We propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches.

Conclusion: AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Conclusion: 对于$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs和包含依赖存在有限基础，但对于full, frontier-guarded和frontier-one TGDs通常不存在。

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESQL, a model that enhances text-to-SQL accuracy on the WikiSQL dataset by improving WHERE clause parsing and reducing reliance on manual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the foundational capabilities and generalization of text-to-SQL models in real-world applications.

Method: The paper integrates model interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing of WHERE clauses, augmented with filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion, to design the CESQL model.

Result: The CESQL model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction outcomes, especially for conditional values in WHERE clauses.

Conclusion: The CESQL model improves accuracy on the WikiSQL dataset, especially in predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, while reducing dependence on data within condition columns and manually labeled training data.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 搜索型LLM代理在评估时存在搜索时污染问题，代理可以直接在HuggingFace上找到答案，从而影响评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估数据泄漏到模型训练数据中会导致过拟合，从而损害测试有效性。当检索步骤浮出一个包含测试问题（或近似重复）及其答案的来源时，会发生搜索时污染 (STC)，从而使代理能够复制而不是真正地推断或推理，从而破坏基准的完整性。

Method: 通过实验

Result: 在三个常用的能力基准测试中，大约 3% 的问题可以直接在HuggingFace上找到带有真实标签的数据集。在阻止 HuggingFace 后，受污染子集的准确率下降了大约 15%。

Conclusion: 提出最佳实践，以解决这种新型泄漏并确保对基于搜索的 LLM 代理进行可信的评估。为了方便审核评估结果，我们还公开发布了实验的完整日志。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

### [101] [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一种轻量级的token合并框架，旨在实现高效的next-token预测，它通过动态选择token并结合transformer先验来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型在语言、视觉和视频领域扩展到更大的输入，token级别计算的成本已成为一个关键瓶颈。虽然之前的工作表明只有一部分token显著影响下游预测，但大多数token选择方法是静态的、特定于模态的或与自回归生成不兼容。

Method: QuickMerge基于注意力范数大小动态选择减少数量的token，并由基于熵的预算估计器引导。为了保持自回归兼容性，我们引入了一个在合并的token序列上训练的轻量级transformer先验。

Result: QuickMerge在多模态领域实现了计算精度权衡方面的一致改进。QuickMerge显著减少了token计数，同时匹配并超过了学习过的tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge减少了token数量，同时匹配并超过了学习过的tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI sustains higher strategic tension for longer than humans in chess, suggesting implications for AI usage in complex strategic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI games.

Method: a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board

Result: the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300 Elo.

Conclusion: Highly competitive AI tolerates interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity, which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型代理中，记忆是实现个性化的关键能力，通过存储和利用用户的信息。在现实世界中，复杂的任务通常需要在大量用户信息上进行多跳推理，这对当前的记忆方法提出了严峻的挑战。

Method: 提出了多跳个性化推理任务，并构建了一个数据集以及统一的评估框架。实现了各种显式和隐式记忆方法，并进行了综合实验。探索了结合这两种范例的混合方法。

Conclusion: 提出了HybridMem方法，并通过大量实验证明了其有效性。为了回馈研究社区，该项目已在https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR上发布。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Conclusion: 提出了一个AI工作流程和代理设计，可以广泛应用于不同的材料，为人工智能驱动的材料发现提供了一个范例。

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Motivation: 心血管疾病 (CVD) 仍然是全世界死亡的主要原因，医疗保健工作者的严重短缺加剧了这一负担。人工智能 (AI) agent 已显示出通过自动早期检测和主动筛查来弥合这一差距的潜力，但它们的临床应用仍然受到以下因素的限制：1) 基于提示的临床角色分配，依赖于没有领域特定工具支持的内在模型能力；或 2) 刚性的顺序工作流程，而临床护理通常需要自适应推理，即对特定测试进行排序，并根据其结果指导个性化的后续步骤；3) 没有持续学习能力的一般和静态知识库；以及 4) 固定的单模或双模输入，并且在需要进一步澄清时缺乏按需视觉输出。

Method: 提出了一个多模态框架 CardAIc-Agents，通过 CardiacRAG agent 从可更新的心脏知识中生成通用计划，并由 chief agent 集成工具来自主执行这些计划并交付决策。此外，还提出了一个逐步更新策略，以动态地根据先前的执行结果细化计划，并在任务被评估为复杂时进行。 引入了一个多学科讨论工具来解释具有挑战性的案例，从而支持进一步的调整。当临床医生提出疑虑时，会提供视觉审查小组来协助最终验证。

Result: 提出的 CardAIc-Agents 框架能够增强模型与外部工具的集成，并自适应地支持各种心脏任务。通过 CardiacRAG agent 生成通用计划，chief agent 集成工具自主执行计划并做出决策。 采用逐步更新策略，根据执行结果动态优化计划。引入多学科讨论工具以解释复杂案例，并提供视觉审查面板以协助验证。

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents 在三个数据集上的实验表明，与主流的视觉-语言模型（VLM）、最先进的 Agent 系统和微调的 VLM 相比，该框架具有更高的效率。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: 基于LLM的进化计算（EC）框架中的自动启发式设计（AHD）已显示出有希望的结果。然而，由于静态算子的使用和缺乏知识积累机制，其有效性受到阻碍。

Method: HiFo-Prompt框架，该框架使用两种协同提示策略来指导LLM：Foresight和Hindsight。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt显著优于现有基于LLM的AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式方法，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更高的查询效率。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: extract highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs from real-world financial documents

Method: present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation)

Result: TASER outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings

Conclusion: The results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP is a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together.

Method: develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures.

Result: LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

Conclusion: This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space, limiting cross-modal generalisation.

Method: Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse modalities into a unified semantic space. It employs a shared prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor.

Result: SPANER achieves competitive few-shot retrieval performance and preserves high semantic coherence.

Conclusion: SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Aligning embedding structures is important for scalable multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Method: STPFormer，一种时空模式感知Transformer，通过统一和可解释的表示学习实现了最先进的性能。它集成了四个模块：用于模式感知时间编码的时间位置聚合器（TPA），用于顺序空间学习的空间序列聚合器（SSA），用于跨域对齐的时空图匹配（STGM）以及用于多尺度融合的注意力混合器。

Conclusion: STPFormer在五个真实世界的数据集上始终设置了新的SOTA结果，消融和可视化证实了其有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world
datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引入离散最小-最大违背（DMMV）作为一种通用优化问题，旨在寻找变量的离散值分配，以最小化最大约束违背，适用于具有最坏情况性能要求的广泛用例。

Method: 开发了一种GPU加速启发式算法，利用DMMV的数学特性来加速求解过程。

Result: 在量化方面，相比现有方法平均提升14%；在离散断层扫描中，在均匀噪声下减少了16%的重建误差，并在GPU上加速了6倍；对于FIR滤波器设计，与商业整数优化求解器Gurobi相比，几乎实现了50%的纹波减少。

Conclusion: 提出的GPU加速启发式算法在三个不同的问题上都表现出优势，证明了研究DMMV作为无上下文优化问题的益处。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

TL;DR: LM agent在安全关键场景中存在风险，它们通常无法识别和避免危险行为。通过风险验证器可以显著减少危险行为的执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型（LM）agent在自动化现实世界任务方面表现出巨大的潜力，但在安全关键场景中，它们存在各种潜在的严重风险。LM agent的风险意识和安全执行能力之间存在显著差距。

Method: 开发了一个综合评估框架，从三个维度检查agent的安全性：1) 对潜在风险的了解；2) 识别执行轨迹中相应风险的能力；3) 避免执行这些危险行为的实际行为。

Result: agent在识别实际场景中的风险时未能应用这些知识（性能下降超过 23%），并且经常仍然执行危险操作（通过率低于 26%）。风险验证器使危险行为的执行减少了 55.3%。

Conclusion: 风险验证器可以通过将特定执行轨迹转换为抽象描述来有效地识别风险，从而显著减少危险行为的执行。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,

unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent

TL;DR: EAG-RL是一种新的框架，它使用专家指导来提高LLM在EHR推理方面的能力，并在临床预测任务中表现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在基于电子病历(EHR)的预测任务中表现不佳，因为在建模时间结构化的高维数据方面存在挑战。现有方法通常依赖于混合模式，其中llm仅作为冻结的先验检索器，而下游深度学习(DL)模型处理预测，无法提高LLM的内在推理能力，并继承DL模型的泛化局限性。

Method: EAG-RL，一个新颖的两阶段训练框架，通过专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量的逐步推理轨迹，并利用强化学习优化策略，使LLM的注意力与专家EHR模型识别的临床显著特征对齐。

Result: 在两个真实世界的EHR数据集上的大量实验表明，EAG-RL将llm的内在EHR推理能力平均提高了14.62%，同时还提高了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见过的临床领域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EAG-RL通过专家注意力引导，提高了LLM的EHR推理能力，并在实际临床预测任务中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，用于图表到代码的生成，该方法利用多粒度结构化奖励系统，使用多模态文本和视觉反馈，显著突破了SFT的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习(RL)在视觉-语言模型中的一般推理已被证明非常有效，但其在需要深入理解信息丰富的图像和生成结构化输出的任务中的应用仍有待探索。图表到代码的生成就是这种挑战的典型例子，它需要对可视化的图表进行复杂的推理，以生成结构化的代码。仅靠监督微调(SFT)往往是不够的，这突出了对有效的RL策略的需求，以适当地奖励结构化的输出。

Method: 多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)

Result: MSRL方法利用多粒度结构化奖励系统，使用多模态文本和视觉反馈。在文本层面上，基于规则的奖励验证细粒度的代码细节。在视觉层面上，基于模型的奖励通过将生成的代码渲染成图像并使用评估器模型来评估结构相似性。我们在一个两阶段的课程中实现了这一点，以保证训练的稳定性。

Conclusion: MSRL显著突破了SFT的瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试中，分别将高级指标提高了6.2%和9.9%，实现了与先进的闭源模型相媲美的性能。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training

*Jikai Chen,Long Chen,Dong Wang,Leilei Gan,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P addresses limitations of existing GUI element localization methods by using suppression attention and Fitts' Law-inspired heatmaps, achieving improved performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods neglect spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies, and recent methods face issues with attention drift and click imprecision due to ignoring background regions and uniform labeling.

Method: Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method, introducing a suppression attention mechanism and modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps inspired by Fitts' Law.

Result: V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. Ablation studies confirm each component's contribution.

Conclusion: The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro, demonstrating V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Query Reranker (NQR) to address query answering with soft constraints. NQR refines answers based on examples and maintains robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints.

Method: We propose a Neural Query Reranker (NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively, refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities.

Result: We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: NQR can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.

TL;DR: 提出了ITL-LIME框架，利用实例迁移学习来解决LIME在数据受限环境中解释保真度和稳定性问题。

Motivation: LIME在扰动和抽样方面存在固有的随机性，可能导致局部性和不稳定性问题，尤其是在训练数据有限的情况下。数据稀缺可能导致生成不真实的变异和偏离真实数据流形的样本。代理模型可能无法准确地逼近原始模型的复杂决策边界。

Conclusion: 提出了一个新颖的基于实例的迁移学习LIME框架（ITL-LIME），该框架通过利用来自相关源域的相关真实实例来辅助目标域中的解释过程，从而增强了数据受限环境中的解释保真度和稳定性。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Motivation: 为了维护公司的人才库，招聘人员需要不断地从第三方网站（例如，LinkedIn，Indeed）搜索简历。但是，获取的简历通常不完整且不准确。为了提高第三方简历的质量并丰富公司的人才库，至关重要的是在获取的简历与公司人才库中已有的简历之间进行重复检测。由于简历文本的语义复杂性，结构异质性和信息不完整性，这种重复检测具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种多层次身份验证框架MHSNet，该框架使用对比学习微调BGE-M3。使用细微调整的MoE生成简历的多层次稀疏和密集表示，从而能够计算相应的多层次语义相似性。此外，MHSNet中还采用了状态感知MoE来处理各种不完整的简历。

Result: 实验结果验证了MHSNet的有效性。

Conclusion: MHSNet在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for

extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog

TL;DR: CausalPlan通过将显式因果推理集成到LLM规划中，减少了无效行为并改善了多智能体协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）智能体，特别是较小的开源模型，由于它们依赖于表面水平的相关性而不是基于真实的因果推理，因此在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的行动。这种限制削弱了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划方面的性能。

Method: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，它将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中。其核心是结构因果行动（SCA）模型，该模型从智能体轨迹中学习因果图，以捕获先前的行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来的决策。

Result: 实验结果表明，在五个多智能体协调任务和四个不同大小的LLM（Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B和Llama-70B）上，CausalPlan始终减少无效行为，并在AI-AI和人-AI环境中改善协作，优于强大的强化学习基线。

Conclusion: CausalPlan显著减少了无效行为，并在AI-AI和人-AI环境中改善了协作，优于强大的强化学习基线。研究结果强调了因果驱动的规划对于部署高效、可解释和可推广的多智能体LLM系统的价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Motivation: Single-LLM approaches are limited by parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate clinical information in Medical Decision-Making (MDM).

Method: Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework with two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment using an LLM expertise table and (ii) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration.

Result: EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, a 2.69% improvement over GPT-4-0613.

Conclusion: The EMRC framework outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods on three public MDM datasets, achieving superior diagnostic performance. On the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy, a 2.69% improvement over GPT-4-0613.

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan.

Method: introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one.

Result: these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.

### [131] [The Collaboration Paradox: Why Generative AI Requires Both Strategic Intelligence and Operational Stability in Supply Chain Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13942)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 协作式AI代理在供应链中可能表现不佳，除非结合高层策略和低层协作执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主的、AI驱动的代理在经济环境中的兴起，引发了对其涌现的战略行为的关键问题。本文研究了多级供应链的合作背景下的这些动态。

Method: 通过在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，使用大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的生成式AI代理来隔离其行为倾向。

Result: 发现了一种新的灾难性故障模式，即“协作悖论”，其中理论上优越的协作AI代理，在供应商管理库存（VMI）原则下设计，甚至比非AI基线表现更差。这种悖论源于代理囤积库存，使系统匮乏的操作缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过结合高层AI驱动的策略制定和低层协作执行协议，可以实现稳定性和有效性，为设计稳定的AI驱动系统提供了蓝图。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Motivation: can pretrained large language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?

Method: We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated PyChrono simulation scripts.

Result: These scripts can range from simple single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect, they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the simulator, or recommend modeling approaches.

Conclusion: The framework discussed is general and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated with other application domains.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large

virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Scavenger reduces space amplification in KV-separated LSM-trees by using I/O-efficient garbage collection and a space-aware compaction strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: high write amplification due to the compaction process and substantial space amplification problems in cost-sensitive scenarios.Existing GC strategies often fall short in optimization performance, lacking thorough consideration of workload characteristics. current KV-separated LSM-trees also ignore the adverse effect of the space amplification in the index LSM-tree

Method: proposes an I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme and incorporates a space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size

Result: achieves a better trade-off between performance and space amplification

Conclusion: Scavenger significantly improves write performance and achieves lower space amplification than other KV-separated LSM-trees (including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB).

Abstract: Key-Value Stores (KVS) implemented with log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree)
have gained widespread acceptance in storage systems. Nonetheless, a
significant challenge arises in the form of high write amplification due to the
compaction process. While KV-separated LSM-trees successfully tackle this
issue, they also bring about substantial space amplification problems, a
concern that cannot be overlooked in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage
collection (GC) holds significant promise for space amplification reduction,
yet existing GC strategies often fall short in optimization performance,
lacking thorough consideration of workload characteristics. Additionally,
current KV-separated LSM-trees also ignore the adverse effect of the space
amplification in the index LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze
the sources of space amplification of KV-separated LSM-trees and introduce
Scavenger, which achieves a better trade-off between performance and space
amplification. Scavenger initially proposes an I/O-efficient garbage collection
scheme to reduce I/O overhead and incorporates a space-aware compaction
strategy based on compensated size to minimize the space amplification of index
LSM-trees. Extensive experiments show that Scavenger significantly improves
write performance and achieves lower space amplification than other
KV-separated LSM-trees (including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV-separated LSM-trees address write amplification but introduce significant space amplification, a critical concern in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) can reduce space amplification, but existing strategies are often inefficient and fail to account for workload characteristics. Moreover, current key-value (KV) separated LSM-trees overlook the space amplification caused by the index LSM-tree.

Method: propose Scavenger+, which achieves a better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate index-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts to system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources.

Result: Scavenger+ achieves a better performance-space trade-off.

Conclusion: Scavenger+ significantly improves write performance and reduces space amplification compared to state-of-the-art KV-separated LSM-trees, including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB.

TL;DR: This paper surveys log usage in databases, data warehouses, web, and knowledge graphs, finding fragmentation and a lack of standardization, but also highlighting opportunities for future research, especially in KG log exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research on log usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently consolidates existing efforts. Logs, when effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia, supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements (e.g., performance optimization).

Method: A systematic survey of log usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics? (2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?

Result: Identifies gaps and highlights opportunities in log usage, particularly regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs. Reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches and the absence of standardization across log usage pipelines, but identifies shared structural elements among different types of logs.

Conclusion: The survey reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More

TL;DR: CT-CRS通过整合消费者类型建模到对话推荐中，增强了个性化服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了用户异构的决策风格和知识水平，这限制了准确性和效率。

Method: CT-CRS采用交互历史并微调大型语言模型以自动实时推断用户类型，避免依赖静态问卷。我们将用户类型纳入状态表示，并设计了一种类型自适应策略，该策略动态调整推荐粒度、多样性和属性查询复杂性。为了进一步优化对话策略，我们采用逆强化学习 (IRL)，使代理能够根据消费者类型来近似专家策略。

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp上的实验表明，与强大的基线相比，CT-CRS提高了推荐成功率并减少了交互回合。消融研究证实，消费者类型建模和IRL都有助于显着提高性能。

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过整合心理学建模和高级策略优化，为增强CRS个性化提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

Conclusion: FLAIR在实际环境中表现出可扩展性和有效性，已成功集成到Microsoft的Copilot DECO中，为数千用户提供服务。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven the adoption of
copilots in complex technical scenarios, underscoring the growing need for
specialized information retrieval solutions. In this paper, we introduce FLAIR,
a lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems'
retrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR
operates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user
feedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these
indicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track
ranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected
indicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query.
Extensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance
gains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches. The system has been successfully integrated into Copilot DECO,
serving thousands of users at Microsoft, demonstrating its scalability and
effectiveness in operational environments.

Result: CASPER在八个科学检索基准测试中优于强大的密集和稀疏检索基线。此外，通过简单的后处理，CASPER可以有效地用于关键短语生成任务，在产生更多样化的关键短语的同时，实现了与已建立的CopyRNN具有竞争力的性能，并且速度快了近四倍。

Conclusion: CASPER在八个科学检索基准测试中优于强大的密集和稀疏检索基线。此外，通过简单的后处理，CASPER可以有效地用于关键短语生成任务，在产生更多样化的关键短语的同时，实现了与已建立的CopyRNN具有竞争力的性能，并且速度快了近四倍。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly
difficult for researchers to keep up with the literature. In an attempt to
alleviate this problem, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for
scientific search that utilizes tokens and keyphrases as representation units
(i.e. dimensions in the sparse embedding space), enabling it to represent
queries and documents with research concepts and match them at both granular
and conceptual levels. To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we
propose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals
that capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different
settings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and
co-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on
eight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through
simple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase
generation tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established
CopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times
faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency in conversational job recommendation systems.

Method: leveraging autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools and employs a user query complexity identification mechanism

Result: AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% and significantly improves recommendation accuracy in Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios.

Conclusion: AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics.

Method: L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency.

Result: L3AE achieves gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Conclusion: L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了 HeteroIR 和 HeteroIM 两个模型，以解决推荐系统和影响力最大化方法中的问题。HeteroIR 旨在释放用户推荐系统的传播潜力，而 HeteroIM 弥合了 IM 方法和推荐任务之间的差距，提高了交互意愿并最大化了传播覆盖范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐方法通常侧重于建模交互意愿。影响力最大化（IM）方法侧重于识别一组用户，以最大限度地扩大信息传播。然而，现有方法面临两个重大挑战：推荐方法未能释放候选者的传播能力；IM 方法未能考虑互动意愿。

Method: HeteroIR 引入了一个两阶段框架来估计传播利润。HeteroIM 增量式地选择最具影响力的受邀者进行推荐，并根据包含邀请者和受邀者的反向可达（RR）集数量进行重新排序。

Result: HeteroIR 和 HeteroIM 显著优于最先进的基线，p 值 < 0.05。

Conclusion: HeteroIR和HeteroIM在腾讯的在线游戏平台部署后，在线 A/B 测试分别获得了 8.5% 和 10% 的改进。

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ENCODE: An efficient two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach that balances online service efficiency and precision by clustering the entire behavior sequence and extracting accurate interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadvertently destroy two basic requirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire sequence; R2) extract information from the most relevant behaviors. The performance of online serving systems is significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest information obtained by existing methods.

Method: An efficient two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering based twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction stage and online inference stage.

Result: ENCODE not only meets the aforementioned two basic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service efficiency and precision.

Conclusion: The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ENCODE method have been demonstrated through extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore
users' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging
to accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior
sequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet
such requirements, existing methods "inadvertently" destroy two basic
requirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire
sequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information
from the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned
interests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems
is significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest
information obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient
two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering
based twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction
stage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two
basic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service
efficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE
clusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To
reduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric
learning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative
pairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online
inference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the
associations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance
between user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric
throughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and
comparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed ENCODE.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Calibrated recommendation system guarantees the inclusion of less representative areas in the recommended list. Evaluated with fifteen models on movie datasets, outlier detection models provide a better understanding of the structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience. To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list.

Method: We implement fifteen models that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain.

Result: The results indicate that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the structures.

Conclusion: The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their groups of preferences to the same degree.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MUFFIN是一种新的频域序列推荐模型，它通过用户自适应滤波来解决现有模型的频率覆盖范围有限和缺乏个性化频率过滤的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的频域SR模型仍然面临两个主要缺点：(i) 频率覆盖范围有限，经常遗漏特定频率范围内的关键行为模式，以及 (ii) 缺乏个性化的频率过滤，因为它们对所有用户应用相同的过滤器，而不管其不同的频率特征如何。

Method: 提出了一种新的频域模型，即用户自适应频率过滤混合 (MUFFIN)。

Result: MUFFIN在五个基准数据集上始终优于最先进的频域SR模型。

Conclusion: MUFFIN在五个基准数据集上始终优于最先进的频域SR模型。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions
by modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency
domain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.
However, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:
(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns
in a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency
filtering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their
distinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg
(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering
module (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive
behavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively
emphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other
ranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to
generate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique
characteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse
user behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive
experiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
frequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets. The source code is

*Shouxing Ma,Yawen Zeng,Shiqing Wu,Guandong Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: REARM addresses data sparsity in multi-modal recommender systems by refining multi-modal contrastive learning and homography relations, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal recommender systems using graph neural networks are hindered by sparse data. Existing methods have limitations in producing effective multi-modal feature contrasts and exploring homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence.

Method: The paper proposes a framework for Refining multi-modal contrastive learning and homography relations (REARM). It employs meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies for multi-modal contrastive learning and integrates a newly constructed user interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with existing graphs for graph learning.

Result: REARM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets and improves the distinction between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

Conclusion: The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that REARM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Visualizations show REARM improves distinguishing between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (
i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these
methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although
contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.
  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for
\textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning
and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement
multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal
constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and
retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine
homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user
interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user
co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM
to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an
improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and
modal-unique features. Code is available

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: UniECS is a unified multimodal e-commerce search framework that outperforms existing methods and improves real-world metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems have limitations in handling various modality pairings and lack comprehensive benchmarks.

Method: A unified multimodal e-commerce search framework with a gated multimodal encoder and a training strategy combining CMAL, CLAL, IMCL, and adaptive loss weighting.

Result: UniECS outperforms existing methods on four e-commerce benchmarks, achieving up to 28% gain in R@10 for text-to-image retrieval on M-BEER, while maintaining parameter efficiency. It also improves Click-Through Rate (+2.74%) and Revenue (+8.33%) in real-world deployment.

Conclusion: UniECS demonstrates strong performance on e-commerce benchmarks and in real-world deployment, improving click-through rate and revenue.

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

### [150] [CARE: Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders for LLM-based Conversational Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13889)
*Chuang Li,Yang Deng,Hengchang Hu,See-Kiong Ng,Min-Yen Kan,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARE, a framework that integrates LLMs with external recommender systems to improve recommendation accuracy in conversational recommendation systems (CRS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero- or few-shot methods, but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space, resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative relationships among entities or item sequences.

Method: We introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE customizes LLMs for CRS tasks and synergizes them with external recommendation systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts, producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those recommendations by leveraging contextual information.

Result: incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets

Conclusion: Incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS. The most effective strategy involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. The CARE framework effectively addresses the identified challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with
external recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational
recommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-
or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,
but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific
adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,
resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue
context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative
relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,
we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE
customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation
systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,
producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those
recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and
unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that
incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information
significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average
of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in
the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that

indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified
challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.

Motivation: Improving synthetic query generation pipelines for Neural Information Retrieval (NIR).

Method: Leveraging the InPars Toolkit, fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), and replacing static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts using the DSPy framework.

Result: The two introduced extensions reduce the need for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance.

Conclusion: This paper introduces two extensions to the InPars Toolkit for synthetic query generation in Neural Information Retrieval (NIR): (1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) and (2) replacing static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts using the DSPy framework. The results show that both extensions improve retrieval performance and reduce the need for aggressive filtering.

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large

InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:

*Hardy,Sebastian Padó,Amelie Wührl,Tanise Ceron*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 A2CG 框架，通过在推荐流程的早期阶段引入多样性，并考虑民主价值观，来改进新闻推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于过去点击的新闻推荐系统旨在提高参与度，但代价是限制了建议内容的多样性。虽然存在感知多样性的算法，但它们有两个主要的局限性。首先，它们未能考虑规范性多样性，这需要公平地获取广泛的观点。其次，它们通常在系统的后期应用多样性，在很多内容已经被过滤掉之后。这两种限制都限制了它们的有效性，并阻止它们在新闻推荐中促进真正的规范性多样性。

Method: 提出了一种 Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) 框架，该框架将多样性引入到最早的流程阶段，并使用可配置的机制来使多样性与特定的民主目标保持一致。A2CG 使用多个视角方面（例如，情感、政治倾向、框架）来表示每篇新闻文章，并使用向量量化变分自动编码器 (VQ-VAE) 来创建离散的多方面表示。然后，仅解码器模型学习用户对这些方面代码的偏好。然后，通过在候选检索过程中反转某些查询向量的方面的符号来直接注入多样性，从而确保更多样化的候选项目。

Result: 在 MIND 数据集上进行评估，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在推荐流程的早期阶段实现了个性化和多样性之间的灵活权衡，并生成了更多新颖、多样化和偶然的候选项目，同时有效地考虑了加强民主价值观的方面。这些经验结果使其成为下游民主化新闻推荐系统的一种有前途的方法。

Abstract: Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for
engagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested
content. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which
requires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically
apply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has
already been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and
prevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.
  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these
limitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline
stage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific
democratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of
perspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted
representation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these
aspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some
of the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring
a more diverse set of candidates.
  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off
between personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It
also generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while
effectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.
These empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream
democratized news recommendation systems.

Result: TaoSR1在离线数据集上显著优于基线，并在在线人工评估中获得了显著的提升。

Conclusion: TaoSR1在离线数据集上显著优于基线，并在在线人工评估中获得了显著的提升，为将CoT推理应用于相关性分类引入了一种新的范例。

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

Motivation: To tackle visual question answering on plots, a subtask of visual question answering.

Method: Developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. Trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier.

Conclusion: The cross-modality module in VisualBERT is not essential in aligning plot components with question phrases.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络通过将它们的结构和给定的条件直接纳入损失函数来逼近微分方程。这使得在建模阶段可以轻松添加诸如不变量之类的条件。此外，该方法可以被认为是无网格的，并且可以在训练阶段之后用于计算任意网格上的解。因此，物理信息神经网络正在成为用数值数学方法求解微分方程的一种有前途的替代方法。然而，它们的性能高度依赖于多种因素。

Method: 我们系统地研究和评估了该方法的核心组成部分，即训练点分布。我们用五种训练数据生成策略和浅层网络架构测试了两个常微分方程和两个偏微分方程，这些架构有一层和两层隐藏层。除了常见的分布外，我们还介绍了基于正弦的训练点，其动机是切比雪夫节点的构造。

Result: 结果表明训练点分布对解的准确性有影响，我们发现证据表明它们与微分方程的特性有关。

Conclusion: 训练点分布会影响解的准确性，并且它们与微分方程的特性相关。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Motivation: 先前的时间交互网络(TIN)学习被认为是一个粗粒度的多序列预测问题，忽略了网络拓扑结构的影响。

Method: 提出了一种用于TIN的深度图神经点过程(DGNPP)模型。DGNPP由节点聚合层和自注意力层两个关键模块组成。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验评估表明，DGNPP在事件预测和时间预测任务中取得了优异的性能，效率很高。

Conclusion: DGNPP在事件和时间预测任务中表现出色，显著优于基线模型，并有效缓解了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

effectiveness of the method is confirmed.

TL;DR: RISE is a two-stage framework that overcomes the limitations of SFT and Visual-RFT in complex image annotation tasks by generating visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs and leveraging them for supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning, resulting in improved performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.

Method: RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework. Reason stage: reinforcement learning-driven annotation-reasoning-annotation closed-loop. Inspire and Strengthen stage: supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: RISE achieves robust performance and enhanced explainability on complex and simple image annotation tasks.

Conclusion: RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) for sensor-based HAR using physics simulation to address the scarcity of labeled data. PPDA outperforms traditional methods and reduces the need for large training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the activity labels.

Method: introducing and systematically characterizing Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation. PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to their STDA counterparts. assess how combining multiple PPDAs can reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects used for training.

Result: Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs.

Conclusion: This study highlights the advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in HAR.

Motivation: 现有系统并非旨在实现人机互补：人类使用算法匹配系统做出的决策不一定优于人类或算法单独做出的决策。

Method: 提出了一种协同匹配 (comatch) 的数据驱动算法匹配系统，该系统选择其最有信心的决策，将其余决策推迟给人类决策者。

Result: 大规模人类受试者研究表明，comatch 匹配结果优于人工或算法单独匹配的结果。

Conclusion: comatch 匹配结果优于人工或算法单独匹配的结果。

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction (CP) treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels.

Method: The authors formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem and identify a well-structured subset of candidate solutions.

Result: An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of the approach, and a user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.

Conclusion: This paper presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of prediction sets. The approach maintains coverage guarantees while providing more structured and informative prediction sets.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

*Zhengyan Huan,Jacob Boerma,Li-Ping Liu,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to generate samples via Flow Matching that satisfy given constraints, using either a differentiable distance function or a membership oracle. The approaches show significant gains in constraint satisfaction and can be used for training adversarial example generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given constraints.

Method: The paper proposes an adaptation of the Flow Matching (FM) objective with an additional term that penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples when a differentiable distance function is given. It also proposes employing randomization and learning a mean flow for cases where the constraint set is only available via queries to a membership oracle.

Result: The proposed approaches achieve significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target distributions. The approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator, using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with several future research directions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper studies machine language acquisition with partial observability, proposes a learning-based algorithm to decode private information, and discusses challenges in more general settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores relaxing the assumption of full observability in machine language acquisition, thereby posing a more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent.

Method: A learning-based algorithm is presented to perform the decoding of private information.

Result: Motivating examples are shown and how they can be solved in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general settings.

Conclusion: A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new fMRI classification framework using dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for ASD diagnosis, achieving improved accuracy and AUC compared to static graph-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the development of neuroscience. Current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively.

Method: The study uses a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms. It infers functional brain connectivity using transformer-based attention mechanisms and constructs time-varying graphs processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers.

Result: The model achieves 63.2% accuracy and 60.0% AUC on the ABIDE dataset, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN: 51.8%).

Conclusion: The study validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Conclusion: X-MoE在AMD MI250X GPU驱动的Frontier超级计算机上，将DeepSeek风格的MoE模型扩展到5450亿参数，使用1024个GPU，比现有方法在相同硬件预算下可训练的最大模型大10倍，同时保持高训练吞吐量。

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Motivation: 未来的轨迹在自动驾驶、飓风预测和流行病建模等领域起着重要作用，在这些领域中，从业者通常通过对概率模型进行采样或利用多个自回归预测器来生成集成路径。虽然这些轨迹反映了固有的不确定性，但它们通常是未校准的。

Method: 基于共形预测的统一框架，通过引入新的在线更新步骤和捕获步间依赖性的优化步骤，将采样的轨迹转换为具有理论覆盖保证的校准预测区间。

Result: 该方法可以产生不连续的预测区间，更好地捕获时间依赖性，并提供更清晰和自适应的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法可以围绕每个轨迹生成不连续的预测区间，自然地捕获时间依赖性，并产生更清晰、更自适应的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework (J3O) to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy and how to route queries to maximize overall inference accuracy under constraints. J3O achieves near-optimal accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems. Many real-world applications require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection, segmentation, and depth estimation, but most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios.

Method: We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge, maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads.

Result: J3O consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: J3O achieves over 97% of the optimal accuracy with less than 15% of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

*Nooshin Bahador,Milad Lankarany*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于啁啾事件分析的癫痫灶定位新方法，该方法通过检测异常脑电通道并结合空间信息，尤其在手术成功的患者中，能够有效定位癫痫灶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究提出了一个定量框架，用于评估临床定义的癫痫发作起始区 (SOZ) 与通过啁啾事件的时频分析识别的统计异常通道之间的空间一致性。

Method: 局部离群因子 (LOF) 分析与自适应邻域选择

Result: 基于 LOF 的方法有效地检测异常值，其中指数匹配（按通道邻近度加权）在 SOZ 定位中优于精确匹配。无癫痫患者（指数精确度平均值：0.903）和手术成功患者（指数精确度平均值：0.865）的性能指标（精确度、召回率、F1）最高，而失败病例的一致性较低（指数精确度平均值：0.460）。

Conclusion: 基于啁啾的异常值检测与加权空间度量相结合，为 SOZ 定位提供了一种补充方法，尤其是在手术成功的患者中。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

*Chuyun Deng,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种网络感知的UCB算法，实现了自适应信息共享，并在模拟定价环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑网络上的上下文线性bandits，这是一种序贯决策问题，其中学习同时发生在多个位置，奖励分布共享结构相似性，同时也表现出局部差异。在网络环境中，当信息被部分共享时，很多东西仍有待探索。

Method: 开发了两种网络感知的UCB算法，NetLinUCB和Net-SGD-UCB。

Result: 建立了遗憾界限，表明我们的方法将与共享结构相关的学习复杂性从$O(N)$降低到亚线性$O(\\sqrt{N})$，其中$N$是网络的大小。NetLinUCB在具有细粒度异质性的低噪声状态中表现出色，而Net-SGD-UCB对高维、高方差状态具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出了两种网络感知的UCB算法（NetLinUCB和Net-SGD-UCB），它们能够实现由动态更新的网络权重引导的自适应信息共享。这两种算法在模拟定价环境中表现出有效性。

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAVIS 是一种轻量级的推理时对齐框架，无需修改基本模型的权重，即可动态控制 LLM 的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地部署在需要平衡多个通常相互冲突的目标（例如，有用性、无害性或幽默性）的各种应用中。在这种多目标设置中，使输出与用户特定的偏好相一致通常需要为每个目标或偏好配置微调模型，这在计算上是昂贵的且不灵活。

Method: 一种轻量级的推理时对齐框架，通过价值引导的推理时搜索实现多目标对齐。

Result: MAVIS训练了一组小的价值模型，每个模型对应于一个不同的目标。在推理时，这些价值模型使用用户指定的权重组合，以产生一个倾斜函数，该函数将基本模型的输出分布调整为期望的权衡。

Conclusion: MAVIS在性能上优于微调每个目标模型的基线，甚至接近为用户特定偏好微调模型的理想化设置的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

*Yunfeng Ge,Ming Jin,Yiji Zhao,Hongyan Li,Bo Du,Chang Xu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EventTSF是一种用于事件感知非平稳时间序列预测的自回归生成框架，它集成了历史时间序列和文本事件来进行后续预测，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将基于自然语言的外部事件纳入其中以改进非平稳预测在很大程度上仍未得到探索，因为大多数方法仍然依赖于单一模态，导致上下文知识有限和模型性能不佳。时间序列预测在能源和交通等关键领域起着至关重要的作用，在这些领域中，非平稳动态与其他模态（如文本）中的事件密切相关。

Method: EventTSF使用自回归扩散，并在每个步骤中进行流匹配，以捕获细微的时序-事件交互。为了处理事件引起的不确定性，根据事件语义信号自适应地控制流匹配时间步长。底层去噪器采用多模态U型扩散Transformer，可以有效地融合不同分辨率的时间和文本模态。

Result: EventTSF的预测精度提高了10.7%，训练效率提高了1.13倍。

Conclusion: EventTSF在8个合成和真实世界的数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明，在不同的事件感知非平稳时间序列预测场景中，EventTSF优于12个基线，在预测精度上提高了10.7%，训练效率提高了1.13倍。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的有向图神经网络通常难以共同捕获方向语义和全局结构模式，因为它们具有各向同性聚合机制和局部滤波机制。

Conclusion: SVDformer在节点分类任务上始终优于最先进的 GNN 和方向感知基线，为有向图上的学习表征建立了一个新范例。

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective adaptation requires careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes instability.

Method: dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency

Conclusion: ASAP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC faces challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in MTL. Traditional MTL approaches suffer from "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias.

Method: The paper proposes a classifier called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. It includes prototype perturbation mechanism and introduces a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR).

Result: Experiments on three datasets demonstrate higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed HCAL classifier achieves higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate compared to baseline models on three datasets.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent

Conclusion: DyMixOp在各种PDE基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著降低了预测误差，特别是在对流主导的场景中，降幅高达86.7%，同时保持了计算效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Method: Examine two ways of understanding opacity and explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness.

Result: Opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness.

Conclusion: Explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed MuFlex, an open-source platform for multi-building control strategy testing, addressing limitations of existing testbeds. Demonstrated its capabilities in a case study reducing peak demand while maintaining indoor environmental quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios

Method: MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters.

Result: developed MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination

Conclusion: aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

TL;DR: CALYPSO 是一种混合框架，它集成了神经网络与机制性元群体模型，以捕捉 MRSA 在医疗保健和社区环境中的传播动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 更好地了解 MRSA 风险、评估干预措施和预测 MRSA 发生率是重要的公共卫生问题。现有的预测模型依赖于统计或神经网络方法，这些方法缺乏流行病学可解释性，并且性能有限。机制性流行病模型难以校准，并且在整合各种数据集方面受到限制。

Method: CALYPSO，一个混合框架，它将神经网络与机制性元群体模型相结合，以捕捉传染病（即 MRSA）在医疗保健和社区环境中的传播动态。

Result: 该模型利用患者级别的保险索赔、通勤数据和医疗保健转移模式来学习控制 MRSA 传播的特定区域和时间参数。这使得能够在多个空间分辨率（县、医疗机构、区域、州）进行准确、可解释的预测，并支持对感染控制策略和爆发风险的反事实分析。

Conclusion: CALYPSO 提高了全州范围内的预测性能，与机器学习基线相比提高了 4.5% 以上，同时还确定了高风险区域和具有成本效益的感染预防资源分配策略。

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

### [187] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Input Time Scaling, a method that improves LLM performance by refining inputs during training and testing. It achieves SOTA results on AIME benchmarks with 32B models and finds that high-quality data isn't always necessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on data & training scaling and inference time scaling. This work explores a complementary scaling method: Input Time Scaling.

Method: The paper introduces Input Time Scaling, a new scaling paradigm that refines inputs using meta-knowledge from LLMs during training and testing.

Result: The paper demonstrates that seemingly low data quality datasets can achieve high performance, contradicting the "garbage in, garbage out" bias. They achieve SOTA results on AIME24 (86.7%) and AIME25 (80%) using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B models.

Conclusion: The paper achieves state-of-the-art performance among 32B models on AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks by using input time scaling and training-testing co-design. They also plan to release datasets, pipelines, and checkpoints.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The CROC approach is more accurate than the FROC approach when the number of common variants in the data decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive tests formed on existing common genetic loci have lacked sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Future disease prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants.

Method: collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach

Result: A prediction model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on common variants alone AUC = 0.585. the CROC reached an AUC value of 0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Conclusion: A prediction model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy than one built on common variants alone. The CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when the number of common variants in the data decreased.

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Result: 通过使用两个真实世界的数据集将其与判别式和生成式机器学习模型进行比较，证明了我们模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型可以通过回答医院管理人员的许多重要问题来降低MRSA感染的风险。

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

*Lingyu Si,Jingyao Wang,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper generalizes self-supervised contrastive learning methods into a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) and proposes Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability without using labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated superiority in multiple downstream tasks. However, it is challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies intra-class compactness and inter-class separability since SSCL can not use labels.

Method: The paper proposes a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of an aligning part and a constraining part. It analyzes BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV under GLF. It introduces Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure samples near/far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer/further away in the feature space.

Result: The paper provides empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Both the theoretical analysis and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC), a plug-and-play method that iteratively captures the dynamic relationship between anchor and other samples to induce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

*Tobias Maringgele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis compares a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal scenarios, and releases an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods through a unified interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of practical guidance.

Method: We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS).

Result: Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations.

Conclusion: We distill our findings into a practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data characteristics. All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods through a unified interface.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOL通过知识蒸馏和伪标签细化，在单次通信中构建一个更大、更全面的服务器模型，以解决联邦学习中的资源异构性和通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习(FL)需要统一的模型架构和多轮通信，这忽略了资源异构性，对客户端提出了繁重的计算需求，并增加了通信开销。客户端的预测可能由于倾斜的本地数据分布而有偏差，并且公共数据集中缺少真实标签进一步使可靠的学习复杂化。

Method: FedOL采用知识蒸馏，客户端仅在未标记的公共数据集上交换模型预测输出。FedOL引入了一种专门的目标函数，迭代地细化伪标签和服务器模型，提高学习可靠性。FedOL结合了一种定制的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略，有效地整合了不同的知识。

Result: FedOL通过传输紧凑的预测而不是完整的模型权重来减少通信开销，并通过允许异构模型架构来实现模型定制。

Conclusion: FedOL显著优于现有基线，为客户端拥有宝贵私有数据但计算资源有限的移动网络提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

Motivation: 现有的学习率调整方案可能很复杂，或者需要手动调整一个或多个额外的超参数，这在实践中会带来巨大的计算支出、时间和能源消耗。

Method: 通过利用随机二阶算法，开发了一种可解释的学习率调整方案

Result: 所提出的学习率调整方案表现出与启发式算法相似的模式，但实现起来很简单，不需要任何参数调整，其中学习率应该随着随机梯度的范数减小（增大）而自动增加（减小）。

Conclusion: 该学习率调整方案在不同的经典随机算法（包括 SGD、SGDM 和 SIGNSGD）以及机器学习任务中表现出高效性、稳健性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: FedSheafHN在各种图数据集上优于现有的个性化子图联邦学习方法，并且模型收敛速度快，能有效地推广到新的客户端。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Result: GRAFT通过在低秩子空间中操作和训练精心选择的示例而不是完整批次，保留了训练轨迹，同时减少了实际时间、能源消耗和$\\mathrm{CO}_2$排放。

Conclusion: GRAFT在多个基准测试中，在准确性和效率方面与最新的选择基线相匹配或超过了它们，从而在准确性、效率和排放之间提供了良好的权衡。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Conclusion: PS-PFN在三个基准任务上的实验结果表明，与其他bandit和AutoML策略相比，PS-PFN具有优越的性能。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for heavy-tailed bandits that works well in both adversarial and stochastic environments, with provable regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies on heavy-tailed bandits focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs).

Method: The proposed framework performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. A data-dependent learning rate, termed heavy-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching (HT-SPM), is also introduced.

Result: The proposed algorithm for heavy-tailed MABs achieves an  $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ worst-case regret in the adversarial regime and an $\widetilde{O}(\log T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. The algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed linear bandits achieves an $\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret. HT-SPM guarantees BOBW regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a general framework and algorithms for adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, achieving best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) regret bounds in both adversarial and stochastic regimes for heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs) and linear bandits.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

### [201] [Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy for Reliable Pulmonary Nodule Detection on Chest X-Ray](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13236)

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of medical AI in lung cancer diagnosis by incorporating physicians' background knowledge. The model shows improved sensitivity and reduced uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physicians' trust in medical AI is limited due to concerns about diagnostic uncertainty stemming from knowledge deficiency.

Method: Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that learns physicians' background knowledge alongside Chest X-ray lesion information.

Result: The model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a 10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also decreasing entropy by 0.2.

Conclusion: The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy addresses knowledge deficiency by learning physicians' background knowledge alongside Chest X-ray lesion information, achieving 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a 10% sensitivity enhancement and a 0.2 entropy decrease.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.
