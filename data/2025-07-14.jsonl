Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model.

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role\nin ensuring system security and operational integrity.

In this paper, we advocate for a\ncausal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially\ndistributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect\nrelationships.

Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as\nwater treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early\nwarning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of\nblack-box detectors.

However, they are still constrained by the inherent\nlimitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative\nreasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,\nwe propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought\n(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute\nprogrammatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.\nTherefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,\nwhich can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six\nbenchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,\nwith an average improvement of 7.95\\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.\nFurthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best\nperforming method at baseline by 58.3\\%.

Rather than\nlearning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the\nconsequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this\nwork, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many\ninstances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA\nfine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model\ntowards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task\nand in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising\ngeneralization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these\ntasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even\nfor a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model\nbackdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is\nsufficient.

In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image.

Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model.

To address this, we\nsystematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and\nneural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.\nSpecifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages\nfrom four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and\nhigh-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their\ncorrelation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of\nevaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,\nn-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to\nisolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper\ntokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich\nfusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we\nshow that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as\nCOMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with\nhuman judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the\nlimitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater\ninvestment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks."}

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality."}

In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents.

These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making.

Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive\nexperiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in\nSFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods."}

This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to\ndesign structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned\nend-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer\narchitecture that we successfully adapt to different structures.

To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided\nFeature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),\nwhich simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student\ndistillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion\npatterns into feature representation while transferring the purified\ndiscriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch\nthrough reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware\nVision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern\nembeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding\nocclusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature\nErasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent\nis employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that\ncontain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and\nsubstitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature\ncontamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.\nAfterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch\neffectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust\nrepresentation regardless of the interference of occlusions."}

Moreover, they exhibit limited\nadaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration\nframeworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time\nKG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge\ngraph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion\nwithout any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification.

Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively.

These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of\nLCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose\nHieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables\nmulti-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies.

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy.

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of\nargumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of\nrelationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,\nthe field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and\nextracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep\nlearning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the\nquality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the\noperation of these models in publicly available argument classification\ndatabases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse\ndatasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,\nLlama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the\nChain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms\nthe others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models\nincorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its\nsuperiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still\nmake errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our\nknowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned\ndatasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses\nof known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions\nfor their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of\nthe available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings."}

In general, risk-aversion leads\nto conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in\nconverging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,\nin some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an\nexploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic\n(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper\nconfidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a\nlocal lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value\nfunction. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value\nis increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint\nvalue. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the\nenvironment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety\nconstraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach\nprevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the\nreward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as\nSafety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment\nCityLearn."}

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to\nprior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our\none-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of\nhyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,\nmaking it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation."}

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal\ntube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to\navoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.
