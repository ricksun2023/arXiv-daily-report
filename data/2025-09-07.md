TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用大型语言模型进行基于语音的痴呆症筛查，旨在解决美国阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆症患者未确诊率高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决美国超过一半的阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆症患者未被诊断的问题，并探索基于语音的筛查方法。

Method: 通过在DementiaBank语音语料库上评估九个纯文本模型和三个多模态音频-文本模型，比较了用于痴呆症检测的大型语言模型调整策略，包括上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态集成。

Result: 结果表明，类中心演示实现了最高的上下文学习性能，推理改进了较小的模型，token级微调通常产生最佳分数。添加分类头显着改善了表现不佳的模型。多模态模型表现良好，但未超过最佳纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调，模型调整策略（包括演示选择、推理设计和调整方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测至关重要，并且适当调整的开放权重模型可以匹配或超过商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为RBA的框架，以提高SpeechLMs的语言生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SpeechLMs在指令跟随方面与基于文本的LLM相比仍存在显著的性能差距，尤其是在面对动态和可变的用户语音时。

Method: 采用一种自我合成方法，通过一个强大的教师LLM生成大量高保真对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师的行为对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效地提高了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，优于传统的蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: RBA可以无缝扩展到包括口语问答和语音到文本翻译在内的任务，仅使用自我生成的数据即可在开放基准测试中获得最先进的性能。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

### [3] [Multilevel Analysis of Cryptocurrency News using RAG Approach with Fine-Tuned Mistral Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03527)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用微调的 Mistral 7B 大语言模型和 RAG 进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过图和文本摘要以及情感评分，对加密货币新闻进行多层次分析，提供全面的报告。

Method: 使用 PEFT/LoRA 方法，通过 4 位量化微调 Mistral 7B 模型。将加密货币新闻表示为知识图谱。

Result: 使用微调的 Mistral 7B LLM 模型进行多层次加密货币新闻分析，可以进行信息丰富的定性和定量分析，提供重要的见解。

Conclusion: 知识图谱可以有效消除大语言模型的幻觉问题

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

### [4] [The ProLiFIC dataset: Leveraging LLMs to Unveil the Italian Lawmaking Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03528)
*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 ProLiFIC，一个关于意大利立法过程的综合事件日志，时间跨度为 1987 年至 2022 年。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律领域应用过程挖掘（PM）的有效性受到数据集的可访问性和质量的限制。

Method: 从 Normattiva 门户的非结构化数据创建，并使用大型语言模型（LLM）进行结构化。

Result: 本文展示了初步分析，并将 ProLiFIC 作为一个法律 PM 的基准。

Conclusion: 本文提出了 ProLiFIC，旨在促进法律领域过程挖掘的新发展。

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于生成财报电话会议的语义丰富和结构感知嵌入的多模态框架，通过将它们编码为分层话语树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析系统无法捕捉电话会议的分层结构。

Method: 使用双阶段Transformer架构，第一阶段使用对比学习在节点级别编码多模态内容和元数据，第二阶段综合整个会议的全局嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，生成的嵌入形成了稳定、有意义的表示，反映了情感基调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该系统可推广到其他高风险的非脚本通信领域，并为下游任务（如财务预测和话语评估）提供实用性。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的任务和方法，即在青少年在网上论坛上明确表达自杀意念之前，根据论坛帖子预测自杀意念和行为 (SIB)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是青少年死亡的主要原因，但预测仍然是一个重大挑战。许多病例由于缺乏与精神健康服务的接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了一个独特的机会，因为年轻人经常在网上实时分享他们的想法和挣扎。

Method: 引入了 Early-SIB，这是一种基于 transformer 的模型，可以按顺序处理用户编写和参与的帖子，以预测他们是否会编写 SIB 帖子。

Result: 该模型在预测荷兰青年论坛上的未来 SIB 方面实现了 0.73 的平衡准确率，表明此类工具可以为传统方法提供有意义的补充。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，在青少年在网上论坛上明确表达自杀意念之前，根据论坛帖子预测自杀意念和行为 (SIB) 是可行的。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种廉价、可扩展的方法，用于实时识别长文本生成中的幻觉 token，并将其有效扩展到 70B 参数模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法不适用于实际应用，因为它们要么仅限于简短的事实查询，要么需要昂贵的外部验证。

Method: 利用网络搜索来注释模型响应，使用 grounded labels 指示哪些 token 对应于捏造的实体。使用线性探针等简单有效的方法训练有效的幻觉分类器。

Result: 在长文本响应中，分类器始终优于基线，包括更昂贵的方法，例如语义熵（例如，Llama-3.3-70B 的 AUC 为 0.90 对 0.71），并且在简短问答设置中也有所改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种有前景的、可扩展的、真实的幻觉检测新方法。

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主题识别方法UDIB，用于检测大型语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义发散指标（SDM）依赖于识别提示和响应之间共享的潜在主题，但现有方法优化的是空间邻近性，而非下游信息理论分析。本文旨在弥合这一差距。

Method: 通过将确定性信息瓶颈（DIB）方法转换为高维数据的实用算法，用计算高效的上界代替其难以处理的KL散度项，从而开发了UDIB方法。该方法可以解释为熵正则化和鲁棒化的K-means算法。

Result: 通过将UDIB应用于LLM提示和响应嵌入的联合聚类，生成了一个共享的主题表示，该表示不仅在空间上连贯，而且从根本上被构建为对提示-响应关系提供最大信息。

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供了更好的基础，并为检测幻觉提供了一种新的、更敏感的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究致力于开发一个多模态问题生成系统，以解决目前学习资源丰富但缺乏配套练习材料的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习者面临缺乏与现有教育资源相匹配的练习材料的挑战。

Method: 开发一个多模态问题生成系统，包含多模态输入处理、问题生成、基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）以及端到端交互界面四个主要组成部分。

Result: 该系统能够自动生成来自各种内容格式的多样化问题类型。

Conclusion: 该项目为自动化、可扩展和智能的问题生成奠定了基础，同时兼顾了资源效率、强大的功能和流畅的用户体验。

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

### [10] [AR$^2$: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03537)
*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，旨在提高大型语言模型（LLM）的抽象能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的训练LLM的方法主要关注表面模式识别，忽略了对抽象的显式训练。

Method: 该研究提出AR$^2$，一种对抗性强化学习框架，通过教师模型将核心问题转换成具有丰富叙述性的挑战性描述，同时训练学生编码模型来解决这些问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR$^2$显著提高了学生模型在以前未见过的、具有挑战性的编程任务上的准确性。

Conclusion: 抽象是提高LLM泛化能力的关键技能。

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [11] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，该框架在推理过程中动态构建和扩展知识图谱（KG），整合从LLM提取的内部知识和从外部来源检索的外部信息，以提高LLM的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）由于其参数记忆的限制，在产生符合事实的答案方面经常遇到困难。检索增强生成（RAG）方法通过在推理时整合来自可信来源的外部知识来解决这个问题。然而，这些方法通常将知识视为非结构化文本，这限制了它们支持组合推理和识别事实不一致的能力。

Method: 该方法首先通过提示从问题中提取种子KG，然后使用LLM的潜在知识进行迭代扩展。然后通过外部检索有选择地细化图，从而增强事实覆盖率并纠正不准确之处。

Result: 我们在三个不同的事实问答基准上评估了我们的方法，证明与基线提示和静态KG增强方法相比，在事实准确性、答案精确性和可解释性方面都有持续的改进。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，推理时KG构建是增强LLM事实性的一个有希望的方向，它以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式进行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多文档科学推理任务，旨在提取和对齐相关论文中的动机、方法和实验结果，以重建研究发展链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解科学思想的演变需要跨文档的结构化推理，而不仅仅是总结单个论文。

Method: 提出了一个名为ResearchPulse的基于代理的框架，该框架集成了指令规划、科学内容提取和结构化可视化。它由三个协调的代理组成：用于任务分解的Plan Agent，构建动机-方法思维导图的Mmap-Agent，以及合成实验折线图的Lchart-Agent。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在使用7B规模的代理的情况下，在语义对齐、结构一致性和视觉保真度方面始终优于GPT-4o等强大的基线。

Conclusion: 本文形式化了多文档科学推理，并提出了ResearchPulse框架和ResearchPulse-Bench基准数据集，实验结果表明该系统性能优越。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

yet existing solutions often struggle with efficiency. We present NoteBar, an
AI-assisted note-taking tool that leverages persona information and efficient
language models to automatically organize notes into multiple categories and
better support user workflows. To support research and evaluation in this
space, we further introduce a novel persona-conditioned dataset of 3,173 notes
and 8,494 annotated concepts across 16 MBTI personas, offering both diversity
and semantic richness for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that
NoteBar can be deployed in a practical and cost-effective manner, enabling
interactive use without reliance on heavy infrastructure. Together, NoteBar and
its accompanying dataset provide a scalable and extensible foundation for
advancing AI-assisted personal knowledge management.

*Aryan Gupta,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为 Sprinklr-Edge-OCR 的新型 OCR 系统，该系统专为资源受限环境中的边缘部署而优化。论文对五种先进的 LVLM 和两种传统 OCR 系统进行了大规模的比较评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言、嘈杂和多样化的真实世界图像中进行光学字符识别 (OCR) 仍然是光学字符识别系统面临的重大挑战。随着大型视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 的兴起，人们越来越关注它们在固定 OCR 管道之外进行泛化和推理的能力。

Method: 该研究在多语言图像的专有、双重手动注释数据集上，对五种最先进的 LVLM（InternVL、Qwen、GOT OCR、LLaMA、MiniCPM）和两种传统 OCR 系统（Sprinklr-Edge-OCR、SuryaOCR）进行了大规模的比较评估。评估涵盖了广泛的指标，包括准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖范围、计算效率（延迟、内存、GPU 使用率）和部署成本。为了更好地反映实际应用性，还进行了边缘案例部署分析，评估了模型在仅 CPU 环境中的性能。

Result: Qwen 达到了最高的精度 (0.54)，而 Sprinklr-Edge-OCR 提供了最好的整体 F1 分数 (0.46)，并且在效率方面优于其他系统，处理图像速度提高了 35 倍（平均每张图像 0.17 秒），成本不到 LVLM 的 0.01（每 1,000 张图像 0.006 美元）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使在 LLM 时代，由于其低计算要求、低延迟和非常高的可负担性，用于边缘部署的最佳 OCR 系统仍然是传统的 OCR 系统。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时，存在自我偏好偏差，这会损害评估的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用对比激活添加（CAA）和基于优化的方法构建 steering vectors，并使用一个区分合理和不合理自我偏好的数据集进行评估。

Result: Steering vectors 可以减少高达 97% 的不合理的自我偏好偏差，优于 prompting 和直接偏好优化基线。但在合理的自我偏好和无偏见一致性方面不稳定。

Conclusion: Steering vectors 作为 LLM 评估的保障措施具有潜力和局限性，需要更强大的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [16] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用MIMIC-IV数据库，探讨了SNOMED CT概念共现模式与基于嵌入的语义相似性之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙述，但其非结构化格式给大规模分析带来了挑战。标准化的术语，如SNOMED CT，提高了互操作性，但对概念如何通过共现和语义相似性相关联的理解仍有待探索。

Method: 使用归一化点互信息（NPMI）和预训练的嵌入（例如，ClinicalBERT，BioBERT），我们研究了频繁共现的概念是否在语义上也很接近，嵌入是否可以建议缺失的概念，以及这些关系如何随时间和跨专业演变。

Result: 我们的分析表明，虽然共现和语义相似性之间的相关性较弱，但嵌入捕获了临床上有意义的关联，而这些关联并不总是反映在文档频率中。基于嵌入的建议经常与后来记录的概念相匹配，支持了它们在增强临床注释方面的效用。概念嵌入的聚类产生了与患者表型和护理模式相关的连贯临床主题（症状、实验室、诊断、心血管疾病）。

Conclusion: 总的来说，我们的研究结果强调了共现统计和语义嵌入在提高文档完整性、揭示潜在的临床关系以及为决策支持和表型应用提供信息方面的互补价值。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨领域和目标的立场检测方法，即基于度量学习的小样本学习方法（MLSD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高跨领域立场检测的性能。

Method: 利用度量学习和三重损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异。

Result: 在多个跨目标和跨领域场景中，MLSD 在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型中表现出显著的改进。

Conclusion: MLSD 通过构建区分性嵌入空间，使跨目标或跨域立场检测模型能够从新的目标域中获取有用的示例。

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种新的基于嵌入的语义感知评估指标，用于评估手语生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手语生成评估方法（通过反向翻译）存在局限性，无法捕捉手语的多模态特性，且难以确定评估误差的来源。

Method: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成的方法。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore在区分正确和随机配对方面表现出色（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠 < 7%），大大优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore 能够有效评估手语生成，且对语义和韵律的变化具有鲁棒性，但同时也存在跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型视觉语言模型(VLM)在交互式环境中的grounding能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要在单轮或问答设置中评估VLM，无法充分衡量其在交互式 grounding 过程中的表现。人与人之间的 grounding 是一个通过持续交流逐步达成共识的互动过程。

Method: 引入一个包含四个指标（grounding 效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和人类相似性）的评估套件，用于系统地评估 VLM 在交互式 grounding 环境中的性能。在三个 VLM 之间的 150 个交互式指称游戏的自玩会话中部署该套件，并将它们与人类二元组进行比较。

Result: 所有三个模型在至少三个指标上与人类模式不同，而 GPT4o-mini 总体上最接近。任务成功得分并不表示成功的 grounding，并且高图像-话语对齐不一定能预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件和研究结果为未来 VLM grounding 研究提供了一个框架。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的文档级机器翻译评估框架Align-then-Slide，用于解决现有评估方法在处理长文档翻译时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法假设句子与句子对齐，无法有效评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的整篇文档输出的机器翻译结果。

Method: 该框架首先推断句子级源-目标对应关系，然后重建目标以匹配源句子数量，从而解决遗漏和多对一/一对多映射问题。之后，通过n-Chunk滑动评估阶段，计算1-、2-、3-和4-chunk下的平均指标得分，进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中，该方法与专家MQM排名之间的Pearson相关系数为0.929。在一个新策划的真实世界测试集中，该方法再次与人类判断紧密吻合。Align-then-Slide产生的偏好数据能够实现有效的CPO训练，并可直接用作GRPO的奖励模型，从而产生优于vanilla SFT基线的翻译结果。

Conclusion: 验证了该框架作为文档机器翻译系统的准确、稳健和可操作的评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的部分音频深度伪造检测（PADD）方法，该方法利用命名实体知识，通过语音命名实体识别（SpeechNER）和PADD两个并行分支实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子级别音频深度伪造检测（ADD）与部分音频深度伪造检测（PADD）不同，后者需要在帧级别定位伪造语音的位置。利用来自音频的语义信息，特别是命名实体，仍然是一个未被充分探索的方面。

Method: 该方法包含两个注意力聚合机制：用于组合注意力权重的注意力融合（AF）和用于使用辅助损失引导PADD的具有命名实体语义的注意力转移（AT）。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的基线，证明了在PADD中整合命名实体知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了将命名实体知识整合到PADD中的有效性。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型虽然在许多自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但在理解“具有深度的胡说八道”这类具有隐式含义的语言现象方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型 (LLM) 难以掌握 Drivelological 文本的分层语义。

Method: 构建了一个包含 1200 多个精心策划的示例的小型但多样化的基准数据集，包括英语、普通话、西班牙语、法语、日语和韩语的选定实例。通过分类、生成和推理任务评估了一系列 LLM。

Result: LLM 经常将 Drivelology 与浅层胡说八道混淆，产生不连贯的理由，或者完全忽略了隐含的修辞功能。这些发现突显了 LLM 在语用理解方面存在更深层次的表征差距。

Conclusion: 统计流畅性并不意味着认知理解。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT推理在提高语言模型准确性和可解释性方面取得了进展，但对其如何影响模型的可信度仍缺乏全面的理解。

Method: 本文综述了推理模型和CoT技术的最新研究，并按时间顺序对五个可信推理维度进行了结构化概述，详细分析了它们的方法、发现和局限性。

Result: 推理技术有望通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提高鲁棒性来增强模型的可信度，但推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私方面存在相当或更大的漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在为AI安全社区提供有价值的资源，以了解推理可信度的最新进展。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 该研究重新评估了基于探针的大语言模型安全性检测方法，发现它们学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于探针的方法在检测大语言模型安全性方面存在 आउट-ऑफ-डिस्ट्रिब्यूशन 性能差的问题。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验，包括使用 n-gram 方法、语义清洗的数据集等，来分析探针学习到的模式。

Result: 探针学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而不是真正的语义危害性。

Conclusion: 现有的基于探针的方法存在安全漏洞，需要重新设计模型和评估协议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型（LLM）的移动代理存在依赖LLM理解能力、缺乏与外部环境的交互以及缺乏记忆能力等问题。

Method: MobileRAG包括InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG，利用RAG来更快速、准确地识别用户查询并完成复杂的移动任务。

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval上的实验结果表明，MobileRAG可以轻松处理真实的移动任务，并且比现有方法提高了10.3%的性能，同时减少了操作步骤。

Conclusion: MobileRAG能够有效解决现有移动代理的不足，并在真实移动任务中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM思想结构，称为矩阵思想（MoT），通过列单元通信机制在水平和垂直维度上探索问题，减少冗余并增强推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在问答（QA）方面表现出色，但在面对复杂的QA任务时，由于推理能力不足，性能会显著下降。

Method: 提出了矩阵思想（MoT），一种新颖高效的LLM思想结构，通过“列单元通信”机制在水平和垂直维度上探索问题。此外，通过构建来自检索到的知识图三元组和原始文本的知识单元，开发了一种事实校正机制，以增强LLM推理的初始知识并纠正错误答案。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的数据集上，MTQA框架在F1和EM得分方面优于最先进的方法，并且推理时间仅为基线方法的14.4％，证明了其效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MoT 是一种高效且准确的 QA 框架。

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于现代韩国诗歌情感计算分析的新数据集 KPoEM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在基于文本的情感分类方面取得了显著进展，但由于其比喻语言和文化特殊性，诗歌（尤其是韩国诗歌）仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个包含 7,662 个条目的多标签情感数据集，包括来自 483 首诗歌的 7,007 个行级条目和 615 个作品级条目，并由五位有影响力的韩国诗人注释了 44 个细粒度的情感类别。使用最先进的韩国语言模型在该数据集上进行微调，显著优于之前的模型。

Result: 在 KPoEM 数据集上进行训练的 KPoEM 模型，不仅增强了识别时间和文化特定情感表达的能力，而且还具有保留现代韩国诗歌核心情感的强大能力。在该数据集上微调的韩国语言模型，其 F1-micro 达到了 0.60，而基于通用语料库训练的模型的 F1-micro 值为 0.34。

Conclusion: 这项研究将计算方法和文学分析联系起来，为通过忠实保留韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别的结构化数据，定量探索诗歌情感提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在RAG场景下微调时容易发生灾难性遗忘，导致模型失去先前获得的知识和通用能力。现有的解决方案存在需要访问通用指令数据或难以保持模型原始分布的局限性。

Method: 论文提出SelfAug方法，通过对齐输入序列的logits来保持模型的语义分布，从而减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 大量实验表明，SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 论文的研究结果不仅加深了对RAG场景下灾难性遗忘的理解，而且提供了一种适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL: A self-play fine-tuning method for Text-to-SQL that addresses the limitations of SPIN by using verification-based iterative fine-tuning and an error-driven loss method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN has limitations in the Text-to-SQL task because it doesn't generate new information and the opponent model produces many correct SQL queries.

Method: Introduces a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach to synthesize high-quality data and an error-driven loss method to incentivize incorrect outputs from the opponent model.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL improves the ability of the main model to generate correct SQL by distinguishing between correct and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了 VoxRole，一个用于评估语音角色扮演对话代理的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究主要集中在文本模态，忽略了语音中的语调等副语言特征，并且缺乏标准化的评估基准。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动流程，首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用 LLM 系统地构建每个角色的多维配置文件。

Result: 对当代语音对话模型进行了多维度评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole 填补了语音角色扮演对话代理评估基准的空白，并为未来的研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个名为 CANDY 的中文虚假信息事实核查基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在此任务上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型的使用日益广泛，但它们在事实核查方面的有效性仍不确定。本研究旨在系统地评估 LLMs 在事实核查中文虚假信息方面的能力和局限性。

Method: 研究人员创建了一个 тщательно 注释的数据集，包含约 2 万个实例，并使用 chain-of-thought 推理和 few-shot prompting 等技术来增强 LLMs 的性能。

Result: 研究表明，当前的大型语言模型在生成准确的事实核查结论方面存在局限性，最常见的失败模式是捏造事实。

Conclusion: 虽然单独使用 LLMs 进行事实核查并不可靠，但研究结果表明，当作为辅助工具部署时，它们在提高人类表现方面具有相当大的潜力。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在低资源语言上的效果不佳，主要是因为缺乏标注数据。针对拉丁语缺乏高质量NLP数据集的问题，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用少量的拉丁语-意大利语句对，通过翻译意大利语的单语数据，合成情感分析和多项选择问答(MCQA)数据集。为了保证语言质量和可靠性，采用了严格的过滤和回译程序。

Result: 将合成数据集加入到机器翻译训练中，与现有的意大利语-拉丁语翻译基线相比，结果有显著提高。

Conclusion: 本文贡献包括首次公开发布的拉丁语情感分析和MCQA数据集，为这种代表性不足的语言的更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用奠定了基础资源。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时间约束，缺乏处理更复杂时间查询的能力，并且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播的问题。

Method: RTQA框架采用递归分解问题、自下而上使用LLM和TKG知识解决问题，并采用多路径答案聚合来提高容错性。该框架包含时间问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器三个核心组件。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在“Multiple”和“Complex”类别中取得了显著的Hits@1改进，优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归分解和多路径答案聚合，有效提升了复杂时间知识图谱问答的性能。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在不同释义问题上的鲁棒性，发现模型在面对语言变异时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有LLM评估方法是否能真实反映模型在实际应用中的能力，因为实际应用中存在语言变异性。

Method: 通过对六个基准测试中的问题进行释义，评估34个先进LLM的性能变化。

Result: LLM排名相对稳定，但绝对性能显著下降，表明模型在语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 现有的基准测试可能无法完全捕捉模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性，需要更注重鲁棒性的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the

practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统功能语法在中文文本处理中缺乏自动标注工具，限制了相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 该研究选取人民日报语料库，人工标注构建数据集，并使用RoBERTa模型进行微调，实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 该模型在测试集上取得了0.852的F1值，在识别主语、谓语等核心句法成分方面表现出色，但在不平衡标签样本的识别上仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将功能语法与注意力机制的NLP模型相结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供了一种新方法，并为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for training and evaluating LLMs and MLLMs on sheet music interpretation using synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning, hindering the development of AI musicians.

Method: The authors propose a data synthesis framework to generate sheet music questions in textual and visual formats, creating the SSMR-Bench benchmark and a training set for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Evaluation shows the importance of reasoning abilities, the challenges MLLMs face, and improvements achieved by Qwen models through RLVR. The trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 on MusicTheoryBench. Music composition is also facilitated.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of synthesizing sheet music problems for advancing model reasoning in music understanding and enabling AI-assisted music creation.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other

Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以检测细微的措辞和隐藏的意图，因此需要研究叙事检测和解释。

Method: 微调BERT模型进行叙事检测，使用GPT-4o pipeline优化预测一致性，提出ReACT框架结合语义检索和少量样本提示生成解释，并加入结构化分类表作为辅助知识库。

Result: 整合辅助知识到提示中可以提高分类准确性和解释可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域有应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 为了在人机对话中实现词汇对齐，研究着眼于构建稳定、个性化的词汇Profile，作为词汇对齐的基础。

Method: 研究通过改变转录语音数据量和词性类别中项目的数量，并使用召回率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标评估了Profile的性能。

Result: 研究表明，较小且更紧凑的Profile在性能和数据效率之间提供了最佳平衡。这些Profile是在10分钟的转录语音后创建的，包含形容词5个、连词5个、副词、名词、代词和动词各10个。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建稳定、个性化的词汇Profile提供了实践见解，同时考虑了最小数据需求，为对话Agent中的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模工作主要关注实体特征或话语关系特征，很少关注两者的结合。

Method: 探索了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，整合这两种类型的特征显著提高了连贯性模型的性能。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和话语关系有利于连贯性评估。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Conclusion: 使用MAGneT生成的对话进行微调的开源模型表现更好，在CTRS上，一般咨询技能平均提高6.3%，CBT特定技能平均提高7.3%。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

### [45] [Explicit and Implicit Data Augmentation for Social Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04202)
*Congbo Ma,Yuxia Wang,Jia Wu,Jian Yang,Jing Du,Zitai Qiu,Qing Li,Hu Wang,Preslav Nakov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SED-Aug的用于社交事件检测的双重增强框架，该框架结合了显式文本增强和隐式特征空间增强，以提高数据多样性和模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交事件检测依赖于标注数据，但标注成本高且劳动密集。

Method: 该框架包含显式文本增强（利用大型语言模型通过五种不同的生成策略来增强文本信息）和隐式特征空间增强（设计了五种新的扰动技术，这些扰动技术在结构融合嵌入的特征空间中运行）。

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上，SED-Aug的平均F1得分比最佳基线模型高出约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上高出约15.57%。

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效地提高了社交事件检测的性能。

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)在各种任务中表现出色，但常常表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与监督微调期间学习的标准模式相冲突的指令。本文提出了逆向IFEval，这是一个评估模型反直觉能力的基准，即覆盖训练引起的偏差并遵守对抗性指令的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在遵循与训练数据相悖的指令时的局限性，强调模型在非常规环境下的适应性。

Method: 提出了逆向IFEval基准，包含八种挑战类型，并通过人工循环流程构建了一个包含1012个高质量中英文问题的数据集，这些问题涵盖23个领域，并在优化的LLM-as-a-Judge框架下进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有的领先llm需要进行逆向IFEval基准测试，未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还要考虑在非常规环境下的适应性。

Conclusion: 逆向IFEval可以作为一种诊断工具和开发方法的基础，以减轻认知惯性，减少对狭窄模式的过度拟合，并最终提高llm在各种不可预测的现实场景中的指令遵循可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗保健领域有巨大潜力，但它们依赖于静态训练数据，这可能导致它们提供过时的医疗建议。本研究通过引入两个新的问答数据集MedRevQA和MedChangeQA来评估LLM在这方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识随新研究不断发展，LLM依赖静态训练数据可能导致其提供有害建议或在临床推理任务中失败。

Method: 创建了两个新的问答数据集MedRevQA和MedChangeQA，并使用它们来评估八个主流LLM。

Result: 所有模型都表现出对过时知识的依赖。

Conclusion: 分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略的影响，并为开发更可靠的医疗AI系统提出了未来方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: PARCO: A phoneme-aware contextual ASR system that improves recognition of domain-specific named entities, especially homophones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contextual ASR systems fail to capture fine-grained phoneme variations and treat entities as independent tokens, leading to incomplete multi-token biasing.

Method: Proposes Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation (PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.

Result: Achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. Also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PARCO enhances phonetic discrimination, ensures complete entity retrieval, and reduces false positives under uncertainty, leading to significant improvements in ASR performance.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [49] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在评估大型语言模型(LLM)中的性别偏见时，任务提示的信号作用如何影响偏见测量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关注到LLM在社会影响领域应用日益广泛，性别偏见问题日益突出，需要对其进行测量和缓解。现有的评估方法依赖于与自然语言分布不同的评估任务，这些任务通常包含精心构建的提示，这些提示会显式或隐式地暗示性别偏见相关的内容。

Method: 通过改变提示条件，使测试环境或性别内容变得突出，然后在四种任务格式下，使用token概率和离散选择指标来评估模型的偏见。

Result: 即使是微小的提示变化也会显著改变偏见结果，有时甚至会完全逆转其方向。相对于概率测量，离散选择指标往往会放大偏见。

Conclusion: LLM性别偏见评估具有脆弱性，并提出了一个新的问题：良好控制的测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的“测试模式”性能，以及这对未来基准的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用特征预测框架 (GFP)，用于高效的掩码骨骼建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将重建目标限制为原始关节坐标或其简单变体，导致计算冗余和有限的语义表示。

Method: 用高级特征预测代替传统的低级重建，引入了一个协作学习框架，其中轻量级目标生成网络在空间-时间层次上动态生成多样化的监督信号，避免依赖于预先计算的离线特征。该框架结合了约束优化，以确保特征多样性，同时防止模型崩溃。

Result: 在 NTU RGB+D 60、NTU RGB+D 120 和 PKU-MMD 上进行的实验表明，该方法具有计算效率（比标准掩码骨骼建模方法快 6.2 倍）和卓越的表示质量，在各种下游任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的 GFP 框架能够更有效地进行掩码骨骼建模，并在动作识别任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于UNet分割骨干网络的师生模型，该模型集成了领域泛化模块，用于同时解决有丝分裂检测和非典型有丝分裂分类问题，从而提高特征区分能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家进行有丝分裂计数非常耗时，并且会导致观察者之间的差异。人工智能可以通过自动检测有丝分裂像并保持决策一致性来提供解决方案。然而，人工智能工具容易受到领域转移的影响，并且有丝分裂的数量远小于正常细胞核的数量，这为检测任务带来了严重的不平衡数据。

Method: 该方法将有丝分裂检测转化为像素级分割，并提出了一个师生模型，该模型集成了领域泛化模块，即对比表示学习和领域对抗训练。采用了一种师生策略来生成像素级伪掩码，不仅用于注释的有丝分裂和困难负样本，还用于正常细胞核，从而增强了特征区分能力。

Result: 在初步测试集上，该算法在Track 1中实现了0.7660的F1分数，在Track 2中实现了0.8414的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，将基于分割的检测和分类集成到一个统一的框架中，可以实现稳健的有丝分裂分析。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 GMBM 的框架，用于解决现实世界图像中多个重叠偏差的问题，这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法充分解决多个偏差问题，因为缓解一个偏差通常会允许或加剧其他偏差。

Method: GMBM 包含两个阶段：自适应偏差集成学习 (ABIL) 和梯度抑制微调。ABIL 识别已知捷径的影响，梯度抑制微调从主干网络的梯度中修剪这些偏差方向。

Result: GMBM 在 FB CMNIST、CelebA 和 COCO 上进行了验证，提高了最差组的准确性，减少了多属性偏差放大，并在偏差复杂性和分布转移加剧的情况下，实现了 SBA 的新低。

Conclusion: GMBM 是第一个实用的、端到端的视觉识别多偏差解决方案。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级U-Net模型，用于左心室分割，该模型在保持与nnU-Net模型相当性能的同时，显著减小了模型大小和推理时间。

Motivation: 现有的nnU-Net模型虽然分割效果好，但模型较大较慢，限制了实时应用。

Method: 通过消融实验，评估了nnU-Net中不同组件对心脏分割的影响，包括数据增强方案、架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术。在此基础上，开发了一种轻量级U-Net。

Result: 轻量级U-Net模型在CAMUS数据集上取得了与nnU-Net模型相当的性能（Dice score分别为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），但模型大小缩小了16倍，速度提高了4倍（1.35ms vs 5.40ms）。

Conclusion: 通过消融实验，确定了nnU-Net中对心脏分割最有效的组件，并据此开发了一种轻量级U-Net模型，该模型在保持性能的同时，显著减小了模型大小和推理时间，更适合实时应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的treeX算法，用于从激光扫描数据中分割树木个体，该算法资源效率高，性能与深度学习方法相似，并提供开源Python实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的树木个体分割深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，因此需要一种资源效率高的替代方案。

Method: 该方法是一种无监督方法，结合了基于聚类的树干检测和区域生长进行树冠划分。针对地面和无人机激光扫描数据，提供了两个参数预设。

Result: 对于地面数据，改进后的treeX算法比原始算法提高了精度，F1得分提高了0.11到0.49。对于ULS数据，改进后的算法F1得分为0.58，而原始算法无法分割任何正确的实例。对于TLS和PLS数据，该算法的精度与最新的开源方法（包括深度学习）相似。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为深度学习方法的资源高效替代方案，并可用于半自动生成深度学习模型的标签。该方法提供了一个开源Python实现。

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

TL;DR: Reg3D通过结合几何感知监督来改进3D场景理解，克服了现有方法中仅依赖文本监督的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得了显著进展，但将其扩展到3D场景理解仍然是一个重大挑战。现有方法主要依赖于纯文本监督，无法提供学习鲁棒的3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: Reg3D引入了一个新的重建几何指令调整框架，该框架通过将几何感知监督直接纳入训练过程来解决这一限制。Reg3D采用了一种双重监督范式，利用3D几何信息作为输入和显式学习目标。在双编码器架构中设计了互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，强制执行几何一致性，以鼓励空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D上的大量实验表明，Reg3D提供了实质性的性能改进。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了深度学习，尤其是 EfficientNetB0，在开发使用叶脉特征的自动化植物分类的可扩展且准确的工具方面的潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种更有效的图比较方法，它通过将跨图节点级交互延迟到联合嵌入架构的末尾，并使用可微分图内核作为距离函数，从而在提高速度的同时，保持或优于图匹配网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图比较方法（如图匹配网络）依赖于代价高昂的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理速度较慢。

Method: 提出LayoutGKN，一种将跨图节点级交互延迟到联合嵌入架构末尾的方法，并使用可微分图内核作为距离函数。

Result: LayoutGKN在计算相似度方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度。

Conclusion: LayoutGKN是一种更有效的图比较方法。

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种参数高效的多模态CLIP模型适应技术，它利用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP的内部参数空间，无需注入额外的模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于依赖提示工程和完整模型微调的高成本，将像CLIP这样的视觉语言模型(VLM)适应到新的细粒度领域仍然很困难。现有的适应方法依赖于增强的组件，如提示令牌和适配器模块，这可能会限制适应质量，破坏模型的稳定性，并损害预训练期间学习的丰富知识。

Method: 我们提出CLIP-SVD，一种新颖的多模态和参数高效的适应技术，它利用奇异值分解(SVD)来修改CLIP的内部参数空间，而无需注入额外的模块。具体来说，我们只微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值，以重新调整基向量的比例，用于领域适应，同时保留预训练的模型。

Result: CLIP-SVD在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下，其准确性和泛化能力均优于以往的方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD是一种有效的CLIP模型适应方法，它能够在保持模型泛化能力的同时，提高模型在新的细粒度领域中的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [60] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于边缘设备部署的轻量级植物病害诊断网络STA-Net，该网络具有形状-纹理注意力模块（STAM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高全球粮食安全需求，精准农业和基于深度学习的植物病害诊断至关重要。然而，在边缘设备上部署高精度模型具有挑战性。大多数轻量级网络使用为通用对象识别设计的注意力机制，这些机制难以捕捉到诸如不规则病变形状和复杂纹理等细微的病理特征。

Method: 1. 使用无训练的神经架构搜索方法（DeepMAD）创建一个用于边缘设备的高效网络骨干。2. 引入形状-纹理注意力模块（STAM），将注意力分为两个分支：一个使用可变形卷积（DCNv4）进行形状感知，另一个使用Gabor滤波器组进行纹理感知。

Result: 在公开的CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型（具有401K参数和51.1M FLOPs）达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。消融研究证实，STAM显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力整合领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了一条有希望的路径。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

TL;DR: 本文介绍了水下伪装目标检测 (UCOD) 任务，并提出了一个名为 DeepCamo 的基准数据集和一个名为 SLENet 的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测 (UCOD) 对海洋生态至关重要，但由于光学畸变、水浊度和海洋生物的复杂特征而受到严重阻碍。

Method: 本文提出了语义定位和增强网络 (SLENet)，它包含 Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) 模块和定位指导分支 (LGB)，以增强多尺度特征表示，同时生成包含全局语义信息的位置图，该图指导多尺度监督解码器 (MSSD) 产生更准确的预测。

Result: 在 DeepCamo 数据集和三个基准 COD 数据集上的实验表明，SLENet 的性能优于 SOTA 方法，并强调了其对更广泛的 COD 任务的高度通用性。

Conclusion: 本文引入了 UCOD 任务，提出了 DeepCamo 数据集和 SLENet 框架，实验结果表明 SLENet 具有优越的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改进扩散训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图像训练忽略了时间信息，导致收敛速度慢、分布覆盖率有限和泛化能力降低。

Method: 该方法无需架构修改，可无缝集成到标准扩散训练流程中。

Result: 在HandCo数据集上，该方法加速收敛超过2倍，并在训练和验证分布上实现了更低的FID。它还通过鼓励模型捕获有意义的时间变化来提高生成多样性。

Conclusion: 该正则化减少了梯度方差，从而有助于更快的收敛。

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉-语言预训练框架，它通过局部和全局图像-文本对齐以及放射学语义匹配库来解决现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（如漏读、无意盲视和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，这些问题通常源于遗漏的局部异常、有限的全局背景以及报告语言的可变性。在3D成像中，这些挑战更加突出。现有3D视觉-语言模型无法同时满足精确的局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告这三个需求。

Method: MedVista3D执行局部和全局图像-文本对齐，以在完整体积上下文中进行细粒度的表示学习。为了解决报告可变性，应用了语言模型重写，并引入了放射学语义匹配库以进行语义感知对齐。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面取得了最先进的性能，同时可以很好地转移到器官分割和预后预测。

Conclusion: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的有效框架，它通过多尺度语义增强视觉-语言预训练来提高性能。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CaPL的因果引导文本提示学习方法，通过视觉粒化来提高CLIP模型在细粒度数据集上的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时能力有限。

Method: 该方法包含两个模块：(1) 属性解耦模块，使用布朗桥扩散模型将视觉特征分解为非个体化属性和个体化属性；(2) 粒度学习模块，通过整合上述属性，在两种因果推理策略下构建用于识别的视觉粒度。

Result: 在15个数据集上的大量实验结果表明，CaPL方法显著优于现有的提示学习方法，尤其是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过学习到的视觉粒度，可以学习到更具区分性的文本提示。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

### [65] [EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03808)
*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an event-driven approach to turbulence mitigation (TM) that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to overcome the limitations of frame-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning TM methods are computationally expensive and inefficient due to the need for high-capacity networks to learn from coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames. Event cameras offer a potential solution with their efficient sparse and asynchronous imaging mechanism.

Method: The authors propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion, based on the 'event-lucky insight' which reveals the correlation between turbulence distortions and the inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art TM methods in terms of model size, inference latency, and model complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art restoration quality on a newly created real-world event-driven TM dataset.

Conclusion: The introduction of event modality into the TM task demonstrates great efficiency merit.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba achieves better accuracy and efficiency in RGB-Event detection by adaptively sparsifying multimodal features and efficiently integrating complementary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods uniformly process low-information regions in RGB and Event data, leading to high computational costs and suboptimal performance. Current token sparsification methods use fixed thresholds, hindering informative token retention for varying complexities.

Method: The paper proposes FocusMamba, which includes an Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy to adaptively discard low-information regions and a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module to integrate complementary features.

Result: Experiments on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets show FocusMamba achieves superior performance in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FocusMamba effectively balances accuracy and efficiency by adaptively sparsifying multimodal features and integrating complementary information, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有食物识别方法无法识别新出现的菜肴类别，因此需要零样本食物学习（ZSFL）。

Method: 提出了SalientFusion方法，该方法包含两个组成部分：SalientFormer（去除背景冗余并利用深度特征解决角色混淆）和DebiasAT（通过将提示与视觉特征对齐来减少语义偏差）。

Conclusion: SalientFusion是一种有效的组合零样本食物识别方法，能够解决背景冗余、角色混淆和语义偏差等挑战。

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing

the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自回归的方法在长期生成中存在效率低下、时间退化和缺乏可控性的问题。为了解决这些问题，本文将占据世界模型重新表述为一个时间下一个尺度预测（TENS）任务。

Method: 本文将时间序列建模问题分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测的建模，并使用TensFormer来管理占据序列的时间因果关系和空间关系。此外，还提出了一种整体姿势聚合策略，用于统一建模占据和自我运动。

Result: 实验表明，OccTENS在占据质量和推理速度方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: OccTENS可以有效地管理占据序列的时间因果关系和空间关系，并实现可控的、高保真的长期占据生成，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，用于在不同类别的图像对之间建立密集对应关系，该方法利用了对象的功能信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别图像中建立密集对应关系的任务具有挑战性。对象的功能可以指导如何建立对应关系，因为实现特定功能的对象部分通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 该方法利用视觉-语言模型来伪标记多视图图像以获得功能部件，并将其与像素对应的密集对比学习相结合，以将功能和空间知识提炼到一个新模型中。

Result: 在合成和真实评估数据集上的结果表明，该方法优于baseline解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在建立密集功能对应关系方面具有优势。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Attn-Adapter的新型在线少样本学习框架，通过双重注意力机制增强CLIP的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在零样本图像识别方面表现出色，但在少样本场景中面临挑战，因为使用prompt learning进行计算密集型离线微调存在过拟合的风险。

Method: 该方法通过Memory Attn-Adapter提炼类别嵌入，并使用Local-Global Attn-Adapter整合局部和全局特征来丰富图像嵌入。

Result: Attn-Adapter在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于现有方法，同时保持了高效的推理和跨CLIP骨干网络的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter 能够在不重新训练基础模型的情况下，通过少量标记样本进行动态适应。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

*Xiaofu Chen,Israfel Salazar,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种新的图像描述评估指标SPECS，它在效率和与人类判断的相关性之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标要么无法捕捉语义正确性，要么计算成本太高，不适合在模型开发过程中迭代使用。

Method: SPECS修改了CLIP模型，引入了一个新的目标，强调特异性，奖励正确的细节，惩罚不正确的细节。

Result: SPECS在与人类判断的相关性方面与基于LLM的指标相当，但效率更高。

Conclusion: SPECS是一种用于图像描述模型开发的实用替代方案。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Result: ChexGen通过专家评估和定量指标实现了X光片的精确合成。它在数据增强和预训练方面表现出效用，并在疾病分类、检测和分割任务中提高了性能。此外，该模型能够创建多样化的患者队列，通过检测和减轻人口统计学偏差来增强模型的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项研究支持了生成式基础模型在构建更准确、数据高效和公平的医疗AI系统中的变革性作用。

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端学习的多视角视频编码（LMVC）框架，该框架确保随机访问和向后兼容性，同时提高压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体积视频的关键数据源，可实现沉浸式 3D 场景重建，但由于其海量数据量，在存储和传输方面带来了巨大的挑战。最近，基于深度学习的端到端视频编码取得了巨大的成功，但大多数集中在单视角或立体视频上，而对一般多视角场景的探索不足。

Method: 本文的关键创新在于有效地利用独立视角的运动和内容信息来增强相关视角的压缩。具体来说，为了利用视角间的运动相关性，我们提出了一种基于特征的视角间运动矢量预测方法，该方法将相关视角的运动编码建立在解码后的独立视角运动特征的基础上，以及一个学习视角间运动先验的视角间运动熵模型。为了利用视角间的内容相关性，我们提出了一种无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，该模块从解码后的独立视角内容特征预测视角间上下文，并结合一个捕获视角间上下文先验的视角间上下文熵模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们提出的 LMVC 框架大大优于传统 MV-HEVC 标准的参考软件。

Conclusion: 本文为该领域未来的研究奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.

Method: TopoSculpt adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and employs a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Substantial improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving by nearly 10%.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects critical topological errors and advances the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动气胸分割流程，用于辅助放射科医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气胸是一种潜在的致命疾病，胸部X光是主要的诊断工具，但小面积气胸难以检测。

Method: 使用带有EfficientNet-B4编码器的U-Net模型来分割气胸区域，使用数据增强和二元交叉熵加Dice损失进行训练。

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，该模型实现了0.7008的IoU和0.8241的Dice score。

Conclusion: 结果表明该模型可以准确定位气胸，并为放射科医生提供支持。

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零样本、无训练的OOD检测方法，该方法利用多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)生成自适应负文本空间(ANTS)，以提高远OOD和近OOD的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假阴性标签的存在会显著降低其近OOD性能。

Method: 利用MLLM来描述可能是OOD样本的图像，生成表达性的负面句子，精确地描述OOD分布并增强远OOD检测。对于近OOD设置，首先识别与负面图像视觉上相似的ID类子集，然后利用MLLM的推理能力为该子集生成视觉上相似的负面标签，从而有效地减少假阴性并提高近OOD检测。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ANTS显著降低了4.2%的FPR95，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法是免训练和零样本的，具有很高的可扩展性，并且自适应加权分数的设计使其能够在不同的OOD任务设置中处理，而无需依赖于特定于任务的先验知识。

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图像和文本模态的多模态遥感变化检测方法MMChange，以提高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数遥感变化检测方法仅依赖于图像模态，限制了特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力，尤其是在光照和噪声干扰下。

Method: 1. 引入图像特征细化（IFR）模块，以突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声。
2. 使用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成双时相图像的语义描述，以克服图像特征的语义限制。
3. 文本差异增强（TDE）模块捕获细粒度的语义变化，引导模型关注有意义的变化。
4. 设计图像文本特征融合（ITFF）模块，实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 验证了MMChange对于多模态遥感变化检测的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决WSI分类问题，现有方法无法充分利用空间信息且计算复杂度高。

Method: 该方法包括一个位置编码模块，用于编码位置信息；以及一个SAC模块，用于执行完整的实例相关性计算。位置编码模块利用切片中的实例坐标来编码空间关系，SAC模块是一个基于MLP的方法，以线性时间复杂度执行完整的实例相关性。

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL方法在WSI分类任务中表现出色，具有高效性和易部署性。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在磁共振成像数据中分割肝脏血管对于血管重塑的计算分析非常重要，血管重塑与各种弥漫性肝脏疾病有关。现有的方法依赖于对比度增强的成像数据，但必要的专用成像序列并未统一获取。没有对比度增强的图像获取频率更高，但血管分割具有挑战性，并且需要大规模的带注释数据。

Method: 我们提出了一种多任务学习框架来分割没有对比度的肝脏 MRI 中的血管。它利用仅在训练期间可用的辅助对比度增强 MRI 数据，以减少对带注释的训练示例的需求。我们的方法利用具有和不具有血管注释的配对原始和对比度增强数据进行模型训练。

Result: 结果表明，辅助数据提高了血管分割的准确性，即使它们在推理期间不可用也是如此。如果只有少数注释可用于训练，则优势最为明显，因为特征表示受益于共享任务结构。

Conclusion: 对该方法进行验证以增强脑肿瘤分割模型证实了其在不同领域的优势。辅助信息成像方式可以增强专家注释，即使它仅在训练期间可用也是如此。

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型多模态模型(LMMs)在多项选择题回答(MCQA)中prompt设计的敏感性问题，发现即使是prompt措辞和结构的微小变化也会导致准确率偏差高达15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LMMs在MCQA中prompt设计理解不足，且模型通常报告最佳性能，缺乏透明和公平的评估。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种prompt类型，覆盖15个类别和6个超类，用于评估10个LMMs在3个MCQA基准上的prompt敏感性。

Result: 发现专有模型对prompt措辞更敏感，而开源模型更稳定但难以处理细致和复杂的措辞。

Conclusion: 根据分析，为专有和开源LMMs提出了定制的Prompting原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出 SliceSemOcc，一个基于垂直切片的多模态框架，用于 3D 语义 occupancy 表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在处理 voxel 特征时忽略了高度轴信息，并且传统的 SENet 式通道注意力在所有高度层上分配统一的权重，限制了它们强调不同高度特征的能力。

Method: 使用全局和局部垂直切片提取沿高度轴的 voxel 特征。然后，一个全局局部融合模块自适应地调和细粒度的空间细节与整体上下文信息。此外，我们提出了 SEAttention3D 模块，它通过平均池化保留高度方向的分辨率，并为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重。

Result: 在 nuScenes-SurroundOcc 和 nuScenes-OpenOccupancy 数据集上的大量实验验证了我们的方法显著提高了 mean IoU，尤其是在大多数小物体类别上获得了显著的收益。

Conclusion: 详细的消融研究进一步验证了所提出的 SliceSemOcc 框架的有效性。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在LML问题上取得了良好的效果，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于飞腾处理器和寒武纪加速卡异构计算架构的无人机跟踪凝视系统，实现了毫秒级响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机系统在动态场景中存在超过200ms的响应延迟，无法满足复杂场景中的实时性要求，这是由于自动识别算法的深度特征提取能力不足和计算架构的效率瓶颈所致。

Method: 该系统在硬件层面采用飞腾FT-2000/4处理器和MLU220加速卡的协同计算架构，通过多卡并行增强计算能力；在软件层面，创新性地集成了轻量级的YOLOv5s检测网络和DeepSORT级联跟踪算法，形成“检测-跟踪-反馈”的闭环控制链。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片的应用提供了一种创新性的解决方案。

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的重排序方法，通过聚合邻居的特征来生成多视角特征，以提高行人重识别的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中在单视角图像的特征，这会导致视角偏差以及姿势变化、视点变化和遮挡等问题。使用多视角特征来表示一个人可以帮助减少视角偏差。

Method: 利用 K-近邻加权融合 (KWF) 方法，通过聚合邻居的特征来生成多视角特征。选择 K 个相邻特征以生成多视角特征，并探索特征聚合过程中的权重选择策略。

Result: 在 Market1501、MSMT17 和 Occluded-DukeMTMC 数据集上进行了评估，结果表明，该方法在 Rank@1 和 mAP 方面均有显著提高。在 MSMT17 和 Occluded-DukeMTMC 等具有挑战性的数据集上，Rank@1 分别提高了 9.8%/22.0%。

Conclusion: 该重排序方法不需要模型微调或额外的注释，使其适用于大型数据集，并且在计算效率方面相比其他重排序方法有显著提高。

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将噪声片段级伪标签视为可靠监督，或让注意力机制将伪标签分散到所有帧，导致初始错误在训练过程中被重复放大。

Method: 结合BiT模块和CATS模块。BiT模块用于语义注入和动态校准音频和视觉模态特征，以定位和提纯更清晰和丰富的语义线索。CATS模块用于语义传播和连接，以实现精确的语义信息跨时间传播。

Result: 在LLP和UnAV-100两个基准数据集上，该方法在多个关键指标上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了弱监督音频-视频解析任务中的问题，并在实验中取得了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个用于生成多角色故事的框架，通过迭代过程保持角色一致性，并通过后处理实现准确的对话分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在角色一致性方面存在困难，导致伪影生成和不准确的对话渲染，从而导致故事不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练的LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，然后使用基于边界注意力的每框掩码技术来控制角色交互并减少伪影。然后，应用身份一致的自注意力机制以确保跨帧的角色一致性，并应用区域感知交叉注意力以实现精确的对象放置。对话也呈现为气泡，并通过CLIPSeg分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion是一种用于生成多角色故事的新颖框架，它优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂提示和风格多样性方面存在不足。

Method: 该框架包含位置风格感知（PSA）模块（利用微调的LLM将提示分解为空间坐标和风格编码的语义指令）和多专家扩散（MED）模块（通过动态专家路由实现跨区域生成）。

Result: 实验表明，MEPG在图像质量和风格多样性方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MEPG框架通过集成位置和风格感知LLM与空间语义专家模块，有效提升了图像生成质量和风格多样性，并具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Motivation: 现有deepfake检测器在受控数据集上表现良好，但在实际应用中表现不佳。Deepfake-Eval-2024是一个新的“in-the-wild”基准测试，旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 重新审视了Ojha等人提出的基线方法，该方法将预训练的视觉骨干网络调整为通用的deepfake检测器，并通过调整超参数来优化其性能。

Result: 通过更好地调整超参数，该方法在Deepfake-Eval-2024上的准确率达到了81%，超过了之前报告的18%，并且与商业deepfake检测器相媲美。

Conclusion: 经过优化的基线方法在准确率上具有竞争力，并讨论了准确率、计算成本和可解释性之间的权衡，着重关注了这些deepfake检测器在实际部署中的可行性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 可靠的缺陷检测需要高分辨率数据和有效的多光谱图像处理方法。

Method: 开发了一个集成了可见光和热通道的基于YOLO的深度学习模型集成，通过复杂的边界框融合算法结合通用YOLOv8模型和专用热模型的预测结果。

Conclusion: 结合多个YOLO架构和融合多光谱数据能够更可靠地检测视觉和热缺陷。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web application that streamlines image labeling through AI-assisted automation, integrating foundation models and a filtering pipeline to reduce manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image annotation tools require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets.

Method: VisioFirm employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors and zero-shot models to generate initial annotations, and uses Segment Anything for on-the-fly segmentation. It also incorporates clustering and IoU-graph for improved accuracy.

Result: VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90% reduction in manual effort while maintaining high annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: VisioFirm is a tool that enhances accessibility and efficiency in image labeling with AI assistance.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Motivation: 现有的UCIR方法通常难以处理领域差距，因为对于检索至关重要的对象特征经常与特定领域的风格纠缠在一起。

Method: DUDE利用文本到图像的生成模型将对象特征与特定领域的风格解耦，并以渐进的方式对齐来自域内的互近邻到跨域，以实现解耦对象特征的可靠对齐。

Result: DUDE在三个基准数据集的13个域上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DUDE是一种有效的UCIR方法，它通过特征解耦和互近邻对齐来缩小领域差距，从而提高检索性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

TL;DR: LASER improves VLM performance in GUI grounding by enabling multi-step perception and precise coordinate prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective reasoning over image regions is challenging for VLMs in GUI grounding, especially with high-resolution inputs and complex interactions.

Method: LASER: a self-evolving framework integrating Monte Carlo quality estimation and IoU-based region quality evaluation.

Result: LASER achieves consistent performance gains on ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks and sets a new SoTA among 7B-scale models on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Conclusion: LASER effectively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities for precise coordinate prediction.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: 将DMP整合到语义分割网络中可以提高遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Motivation: 准确量化tau病理对于诊断和监测阿尔茨海默病(AD)至关重要，但tau PET的高成本和有限的可用性限制了其广泛使用。结构MRI和血浆生物标志物提供了与大脑解剖结构和疾病进展相关的非侵入性和广泛可用的补充信息。

Method: 利用来自结构MRI和血浆测量的多模态条件，提出了一个文本引导的3D扩散模型，用于3D tau PET图像合成。文本提示来自血浆p-tau217测量，这是AD进展的关键指标，而MRI提供了结构约束。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法可以生成在各种疾病阶段都具有临床意义的3D tau PET。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于在不同设置下进行tau PET数据增强，为可视化tau病理提供了一种非侵入性、经济有效的替代方案，并支持在不同的血浆生物标志物水平和认知条件下模拟疾病进展。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种半监督医学图像分割框架，该框架有效整合了空间正则化方法和体积先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割网络忽略了特征提取的有效方法指导和数据集的重要先验信息。

Method: 该方法将图像尺度的显式体积先验和阈值动力学空间正则化，以及基于弱隐式体积先验的数据集尺度的Wasserstein距离损失函数整合到主干分割网络中。

Result: 在2017 ACDC数据集、PROMISE12数据集和股肌肉MR图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种有效的半监督医学图像分割框架。

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

*Jianning Deng,Kartic Subr,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自监督框架，用于从稀疏视图、无姿势图像中学习铰接对象表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究需要密集的multiview观测和真实的相机姿势，而本文的方法只需要每个关节四个视图，并且不需要相机监督。

Method: 首先，使用稀疏视图3D重建的最新进展独立地重建每个关节，然后学习一个变形场，该变形场建立跨姿势的密集对应关系。渐进式解缠策略进一步将静态部分与移动部分分离，从而能够稳健地分离相机和对象运动。最后，我们使用自监督损失联合优化几何、外观和运动学，从而增强了跨视图和跨姿势的一致性。

Result: 在标准基准和真实示例上的实验表明，与现有方法相比，该方法在明显较弱的输入假设下，能够生成准确而详细的铰接对象表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图和无相机姿势的条件下，也能准确地重建铰接物体。

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种利用合成图像来解决图像分类数据集中语义噪声问题的新方法。该方法使用合成图像作为可靠的参考点，以识别和纠正噪声数据集中的错误标记样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督学习方法在存在语义噪声的图像分类数据集中面临挑战，即视觉上相似的类别经常被错误标记。因此，需要一种能够处理这种噪声的新方法。

Method: 该方法利用先进的文本到图像模型生成的合成图像作为可靠的参考点，以识别和纠正噪声数据集中的错误标记样本。与传统方法不同，该方法不直接使用合成图像进行训练，而是利用它们来指导噪声数据的清洗。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在各种噪声条件下显着提高了分类准确率，尤其是在具有语义标签噪声的具有挑战性的场景中。在 CIFAR-10 上提高了 30%，在 CIFAR-100 上提高了 11%（70% 的语义噪声），在 ImageNet-100 上提高了 24%（真实世界噪声）。

Conclusion: 该方法与现有的噪声鲁棒学习技术是正交的，当与最先进的噪声鲁棒训练方法相结合时，它可以实现卓越的性能。

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

TL;DR: 现有的GUI智能体无法捕捉页面之间复杂的转换关系，难以泛化到新的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI智能体通常使用跨页面的多步骤操作的连续片段作为先验GUI知识，无法捕捉页面之间复杂的转换关系，使得智能体难以深入感知GUI环境并泛化到新的场景。

Method: 我们设计了一个自动化的pipeline，将连续的片段转换成页面图，显式地建模了页面之间的图结构，这些页面通过动作自然地连接起来。为了充分利用页面图，我们进一步引入了检索增强生成（RAG）技术，以有效地从中检索可靠的GUI感知指南，并提出了一个定制的多智能体框架PG-Agent，该框架具有任务分解策略，可以注入指南，使其能够泛化到未知的场景。

Result: 在各种基准测试上的大量实验表明了PG-Agent的有效性，即使在页面图构建的片段有限的情况下也是如此。

Conclusion: PG-Agent是有效的，即使在页面图构建的片段有限的情况下也是如此。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Motivation: 研究在内生变量被观察而外生变量未完全指定的情况下，精确计算概率值可能不可行的问题。

Method: 提出一种新算法，通过利用内生变量的输入概率来简化程序的构建。对于单次干预的情况，应用列生成通过一系列辅助线性整数程序来计算概率界限。

Result: 实验表明，列生成技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 表明外生变量可以使用多项式基数表示。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于扩散概率模型的自主冲突消解框架Diffusion-AC，用于解决空中交通管理中的冲突检测与消解(CD&R)问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度强化学习(DRL)的CD&R方法存在“单峰偏差”，导致在复杂动态约束下缺乏决策灵活性，容易出现“决策死锁”。

Method: 该框架将策略建模为一个由价值函数引导的反向去噪过程，生成丰富、高质量和多模态的动作分布。同时，采用密度渐进安全课程(DPSC)训练机制，确保agent在从稀疏到高密度交通环境中的稳定高效学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法显著优于现有DRL基准方法。在高密度场景下，Diffusion-AC不仅保持了94.1%的高成功率，而且将空中接近相撞事件(NMACs)的发生率降低了约59%。

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC通过独特的多模态决策能力，允许agent灵活切换到有效的替代操作，从而显著提高了系统的安全裕度。

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态规划框架，使LLM agents能够灵活地决定何时分配测试时计算资源进行规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ReAct）总是进行规划，计算成本高，且在长时程任务中性能下降；而从不规划则会限制性能。

Method: 提出了一个简单的两阶段训练流程：(1) 在多样化的合成数据上进行监督微调，以启动模型的动态规划；(2) 使用强化学习在长时程环境中改进这种能力。

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，使用该方法训练的动态规划agents具有更高的样本效率，并且能够始终如一地实现更复杂的目标。此外，这些agents可以有效地由人工编写的计划来指导，超越了他们独立的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次探索了在序列决策任务中训练LLM agents进行动态测试时计算分配，为更高效、自适应和可控的agentic系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Motivation: 现有的RAG系统透明度低，依赖数据质量，在医疗等敏感领域存在可靠性问题。

Method: 该框架通过扰动、相似性计算和训练加权线性代理，识别对生成输出影响最大的图实体和关系。

Result: KG-SMILE能够生成稳定且符合人类理解的解释。

Conclusion: KG-SMILE能够在模型效果和可解释性之间取得平衡，从而提高机器学习技术的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large

often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升大型语言模型的复杂推理能力方面非常有效，但其背后的机制仍然不清楚。

Method: 提出了层级感知信用分配（HICRA）算法，将优化重点放在高影响力的规划tokens上。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于现有基线方法，验证了专注于战略瓶颈对于解锁高级推理能力的关键作用。语义熵是衡量战略探索的更好指标。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型的强化学习存在一个两阶段动态过程，优化应该集中在高影响力的规划tokens上。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Conclusion: 等长分割方法和新的归一化技术可以有效提高时间序列分类模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Motivation: 现有的自动红队测试方法没有考虑身份的作用，而红队人员的身份和背景会影响他们的红队测试策略以及他们可能发现的风险类型。

Method: 该方法首先引入了一种基于“红队专家”角色或“普通 AI 用户”角色来改变提示的方法。然后，开发了一种动态角色生成算法，该算法可以自动生成适应不同种子提示的各种角色类型。此外，还开发了一组新的指标来显式测量“突变距离”以补充现有的对抗性提示的多样性测量。

Result: 实验表明，与最先进的自动红队测试方法 RainbowPlus 相比，通过角色突变，对抗性提示的攻击成功率有了显着提高（高达 144.1%），同时保持了提示的多样性。

Conclusion: 讨论了不同角色类型和突变方法的优势和局限性，揭示了未来探索自动和人工红队测试方法之间互补性的机会。

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）中的人格特征，发现指令对齐稳定了特征表达，但自我报告的特征不能可靠地预测行为，且角色注入对行为的影响不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否像人类一样展现出一致的行为模式，类似于友善性和自我调节等人格特质。现有研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证。

Method: 系统地表征LLM人格的三个维度：(1) 特征在训练阶段的动态出现和演变；(2) 自我报告的特征在行为任务中的预测有效性；(3) 目标干预（如角色注入）对自我报告和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定了特征表达，并加强了特征相关性，与人类数据相似。然而，这些自我报告的特征不能可靠地预测行为，观察到的关联也常常与人类模式不同。角色注入虽然可以成功地引导自我报告，但对实际行为的影响很小或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，并强调需要在对齐和可解释性方面进行更深入的评估，区分表面层次的特征表达和行为一致性。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的能力使人们认为合成智能体可以代替人类受试者参与研究。但是，该研究发现LLM在不同的实验环境中不能保持内在一致性，因此无法准确地代替人类受试者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否可以作为人类受试者的替代品。之前的研究主要关注LLM生成的调查数据是否与人类的反应一致。本文则关注LLM是否能保持内在一致性。

Method: 设计了一个实验来揭示智能体的内部状态，并在一个基本的对话环境中检查智能体的行为。通过这个设计来评估智能体的对话行为是否与其内部状态一致。

Result: 研究结果表明，不同模型家族和不同模型大小的LLM都存在显著的内在不一致性。

Conclusion: 虽然智能体可以生成与人类相似的反应，但它们无法保持内在一致性，因此无法准确地代替人类受试者参与研究。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAGuard is a RAG framework that integrates safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals to improve the accuracy and safety of LLMs in Offshore Wind maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLMs often fail when confronted with highly specialised or unexpected scenarios in Offshore Wind maintenance, where accuracy and safety are paramount.

Method: RAGuard issues parallel queries to two indices and allocates separate retrieval budgets for knowledge and safety. It also includes a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool, hard-clamping exact slot guarantees to safety.

Result: RAGuard shows an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0% in RAG to more than 50% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60%.

Conclusion: RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Method: 构建了一个供应链计划代理（SCPA）框架

Result: 在京东的真实场景中部署了该框架，证明了LLM-agent在供应链中的应用是可行的。它有效地减少了劳动力，提高了准确性、库存可用性和其他关键指标。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型的快速发展为解决实际问题提供了新的工具。

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多智能体 LLM 系统框架，该框架通过学习元认知策略来提高复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型多智能体系统通常受限于固定的协作协议，忽略了智能体内部的认知能力，使得智能体无法根据内部认知状态调整策略。

Method: 论文提出了 Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF)，其中智能体学习一组高级元认知动作（坚持、改进和让步）的去中心化策略。为了解决传统策略梯度不稳定的问题，论文还开发了一种新的强化学习算法 SoftRankPO。

Result: 实验结果表明，与六种最先进的启发式和基于学习的多智能体推理算法相比，MPDF 与 SoftRankPO 在五个数学和通用推理基准测试中实现了 4-5% 的平均准确率绝对提升。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种学习多智能体 LLM 系统自适应元认知策略的新范例，将重点从设计固定协议转移到学习动态的、审慎的策略。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在社会政策制定中提供新见解的潜力，特别是在解决无家可归问题方面。

Method: 开发了一个新的基准，该基准由跨四个地区的政策选择的决策场景组成（美国南本德；西班牙巴塞罗那；南非约翰内斯堡；中国澳门特别行政区）。范围内的政策以人类发展的能力方法的概念框架为基础。我们还提出了一个自动化的管道，将基准政策连接到基于代理的模型，并且我们通过模拟的社会情景探索了推荐政策的社会影响。

Result: 论文结果揭示了利用LLM进行社会政策制定的潜力。

Conclusion: 如果在与当地领域专家合作的情况下引入负责任的保障措施和情境校准，LLM可以大规模地为人类提供有价值的见解，以替代政策的形式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于模型上下文协议（MCP）的零训练、防幻觉映射系统，用于将源医学术语映射到OMOP标准概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在OMOP CDM中，将源医学术语映射到OMOP标准概念是数据标准化的关键步骤，但该过程耗费资源且容易出错。大型语言模型（LLM）有潜力促进这一过程，但由于其幻觉倾向，未经训练和专家验证，它们不适合临床部署。

Method: 该系统基于模型上下文协议（MCP），允许LLM与外部资源和工具进行交互。该系统实现了可解释的映射，并显著提高了效率和准确性。

Result: 该系统提供实时词汇查找和结构化推理输出，适用于探索性和生产环境。

Conclusion: 该系统能够以最小的努力显著提高效率和准确性，适用于临床部署。

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种综合的、数据驱动的方法来解码游客感知，并有助于在旅游、遗产保护和具有审美吸引力的公共空间设计中做出明智的决策。

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Motivation: 当前评估方法主要依赖于主观的人工评估，限制了可扩展性、透明度和有效性。因此，需要一种更客观和可扩展的方法。

Method: 构建两个并行的 KG：(i) 使用显式基于规则的方法构建的确定性 KG，以及 (ii) 从实时文本数据流动态导出的 LLM 生成的 KG。然后，使用 KG 指标量化结构偏差和语义差异。

Result: 通过建立基于历史结构指标分布的动态异常阈值，该方法主动识别并标记重大偏差，从而及时检测语义异常或幻觉。

Conclusion: 这种在确定性和动态生成的 KG 之间进行结构化的、指标驱动的比较，提供了一个强大且可扩展的评估框架。

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Motivation: 传统的探索方法（如Novelty Search）在局部新颖性耗尽时常常停滞，无法到达遥远、未探索的区域。

Method: E&E利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)生成语言目标，即对有趣但假设的模式的描述，从而驱动探索进入未知的区域。通过在与人类感知对齐的语义空间中操作，E&E以概念上有意义的方式评估新颖性并生成目标。

Result: 在Flow Lenia上进行测试，E&E比现有的探索方法发现了更多样化的解决方案。来自探险的解决方案不成比例地影响长期探索，解锁了新的行为生态位，作为后续搜索的垫脚石。

Conclusion: E&E有能力突破局部新颖性边界，并以与人类对齐的、可解释的方式探索行为景观，为人工生命及其他领域的开放式探索提供了一个有希望的模板。

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的医学基础模型通常以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部有根据的可解释性，这阻碍了它们的实际临床部署。

Method: DeepMedix-R1 利用顺序训练管道：首先在精选的CXR指令数据上进行微调，以具备基本的CXR解释能力，然后暴露于高质量的合成推理样本以实现冷启动推理，最后通过在线强化学习进行改进，以提高有根据的推理质量和生成性能。

Result: 定量评估表明，在报告生成（例如，比LLaVA-Rad和MedGemma分别提高14.54%和31.32%）和视觉问答（例如，比MedGemma和CheXagent分别提高57.75%和23.06%）任务中，DeepMedix-R1 取得了显著的改进。专家对生成的推理步骤的审查表明，与已建立的Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型相比，DeepMedix-R1 具有更好的可解释性和临床合理性（总体偏好为0.7416 vs. 0.2584）。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了医学FM朝着整体、透明和临床可操作的CXR解释建模发展。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Motivation: 现有的方法将控制参数作为约束来处理，而不是作为决策点。

Method: 开发了一种best-first的启发式搜索算法，该算法在由控制参数定义的无限决策空间上运行，并证明了在一定条件下的极限完整性。

Result: 结果表明，这种新的搜索算法是解决涉及控制参数的规划问题的现有方法的有竞争力的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该算法通过延迟部分扩展的概念，逐步扩展状态的后继节点，从而在具有控制参数的规划问题中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身智能中，一个持续的挑战是使智能体能够稳健地适应新的领域，而不需要大量的数据收集或重新训练。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

### [126] [Meta-Policy Reflexion: Reusable Reflective Memory and Rule Admissibility for Resource-Efficient LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03990)
*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR) improves LLM agent performance by consolidating reflections into a reusable Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applying it during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies are ephemeral, and reinforcement learning requires substantial updates.

Method: The paper introduces Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR), a hybrid framework that uses a Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) with soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks (HAC).

Result: MPR shows consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness compared to Reflexion baselines, with rule admissibility further improving stability. The mechanisms behind these gains are analyzed.

Conclusion: MPR externalizes reusable knowledge, enforces domain constraints, and retains adaptability. Future directions include multimodal and multi-agent extensions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

*Jinyuan Li,Yi Chu,Yiwen Sun,Mengchuan Zou,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为AutoPBO的新框架，该框架利用大型语言模型（LLM）来自动增强伪布尔优化（PBO）局部搜索求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PBO求解器设计通常需要大量专家工作和手动调整，而大型语言模型在自动化算法设计方面具有潜力，但尚未应用于优化PBO求解器。

Method: 该论文提出了AutoPBO，一种基于LLM的框架，用于自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器。

Result: AutoPBO在四个公共基准测试中表现出优于现有局部搜索方法的显著改进，并在与最先进的竞争对手相比保持了竞争优势。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了CoT-Space框架，将LLM推理视为连续语义空间中的优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级别的强化学习框架无法与复杂的多步骤思维过程（如CoT）的推理级别性质对齐，因此存在理论差距。

Method: 该论文提出了CoT-Space框架，将LLM推理从离散的token预测任务重塑为连续的、推理级别的语义空间中的优化过程，并从噪声和风险的角度分析了这一过程。

Result: 该论文证明了收敛到最佳CoT长度是欠拟合和过拟合之间基本权衡的自然结果，并通过大量实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为过度思考等经验现象提供了一个连贯的解释，而且为指导未来开发更有效和更通用的推理代理提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

TL;DR: 神经符号LLM推理利用LLM将自然语言转换为形式语言，并使用符号求解器来推导正确的结果。论文表明，形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理成功的一个重要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经符号LLM推理成功的因素，特别关注形式语言的选择。

Method: 通过比较三种数据集和七个LLM上的四种形式语言，研究形式语言的选择对句法和语义推理能力的影响。

Result: 形式语言的选择会影响句法和语义推理能力，并且不同LLM的影响不同。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理中一个重要的考虑因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

TL;DR: 利用强化学习（RL）和基于搜索的路径规划器来加速客机的飞行路径优化，在紧急情况下快速重新计算路径至关重要。训练一个强化学习代理来基于位置和大气数据预先计算接近最优的路径，并在运行时使用这些路径来约束底层的路径规划求解器，并在距初始猜测一定距离内找到解决方案。该方法有效地减少了求解器的搜索空间大小，从而显着加快了路线优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急情况下，快速重新计算路径至关重要，因此需要加速客机的飞行路径优化。

Method: 训练一个强化学习代理来预先计算接近最优的路径，并使用这些路径来约束底层的路径规划求解器。

Result: 燃料消耗与无约束求解器几乎相同，偏差通常在 1% 以内。与单独使用传统求解器相比，计算速度最多可提高 50%。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以有效地加速飞行路径优化，同时保持燃料消耗与无约束求解器几乎相同。

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在简化的扑克游戏Leduc Hold'em中，DQN和CFR两种算法是否会虚张声势。结果表明，两种算法都会虚张声势，但方式不同，且成功率大致相同。这表明虚张声势是游戏的一个重要方面，而不是算法本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机扑克的研究主要关注胜率等性能指标，而忽略了虚张声势这一重要技能。本文旨在研究DQN和CFR这两种流行的算法是否表现出虚张声势的行为。

Method: 通过让DQN和CFR智能体相互对战，并记录它们的行为，来观察它们是否以及如何虚张声势。

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出虚张声势的行为，但方式不同。它们的虚张声势尝试频率不同，但成功率大致相同。

Conclusion: 虚张声势是扑克游戏的一个重要方面，与算法无关。未来的工作应该关注不同的虚张声势风格以及完整的扑克游戏。

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工智能是否会超越人类，成为宇宙的领导者。

Method: 通过比较人类和人工智能的差异，特别是中枢神经系统（CNS）的作用，来探讨这个问题。

Result: 人类的中枢神经系统使我们能够体验情感，从而发展可持续的道德体系，这使得我们更有资格成为宇宙的领导者。人工智能即使发展出意识，也无法超越人类。

Conclusion: 宇宙领导者的最佳基础将永远是 DNA，而不是硅。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在大域上的性质，因为MLN在有限域上定义概率分布，需要了解当域趋于无穷大时分布的性质。

Method: 分析三种MLN的具体例子，包括：1. 仅有一个一元关系符号的无量词MLN；2. 倾向于更少三角形的图的MLN；3. 倾向于更少高次顶点的图的MLN。

Result: 1. 完整刻画了第一种MLN的随机结构的极限行为；2. 得到了关于一阶逻辑的“δ近似0-1定律”；3. 证明了不同MLN的软约束会导致随机结构的极限行为非常不同，并且软约束的权重可能影响或不影响极限行为；4. 证明了无量词MLN和提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上是不可比的；5. 证明了MLN在大域上将几乎所有的概率质量集中在与均匀分布完全不同的可能世界空间部分。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束和权重对大域上的随机结构性质有重要影响，并且MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在表达能力上存在差异。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Result: EvoEmo在成功率、效率和买方节省方面始终优于基线。

Conclusion: 自适应的情感表达对于实现更有效的LLM多轮谈判至关重要。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在测试环境中部署AlphaZero代理的问题，并提出了改进性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练环境在测试时不会改变，这限制了其适用性。本文旨在解决在潜在变化的环境中部署AlphaZero代理的问题。

Method: 通过对标准框架进行简单的修改。

Result: 即使在规划预算较低的情况下，性能也能显著提高。

Conclusion: 对标准框架进行简单的修改可以显著提高性能。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 该研究旨在通过MBTI人格类型来引导LLM代理，从而控制其在认知和情感方面的行为。

Method: 通过提示工程，使用不同的人格原型来启动代理。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个心理学增强的AI代理的基础，无需任何微调，并且可以推广到其他心理学框架，如Big Five, HEXACO或Enneagram。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在推理过程中获得的知识无法持久化，且基于实例的外部记忆方法可重用性和可扩展性有限。

Method: 设计了一种新的概念级记忆方法，包括从rollout中提取抽象概念的策略和检索相关条目的策略，并在测试时动态更新记忆。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准测试中，该方法相对于无记忆基线提高了7.5%，并且性能随着推理计算规模的增加而持续提高。动态更新记忆优于固定记忆设置。

Conclusion: 概念级记忆是一种更一致的记忆设计，可以实现LLM的自我改进。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

*Daryl Chang,Yi Wu,Jennifer She,Li Wei,Lukasz Heldt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为自动约束目标（ACT）的框架，该框架自动找到满足这些警戒线所需的最小超参数变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通常必须最大化主要目标，同时确保次要目标满足最小阈值或“警戒线”。

Method: ACT使用对无偏数据的离线成对评估来寻找解决方案，并不断重新训练以适应系统和用户行为的变化。

Result: 从经验上证明了其有效性，并描述了其在大型生产环境中的部署。

Conclusion: ACT框架自动调整超参数以满足推荐系统中的警戒线要求，无需手动调整，并在实际部署中表现出有效性。

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

### [143] [LLMs for estimating positional bias in logged interaction data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03696)
*Aleksandr V. Petrov,Michael Murtagh,Karthik Nagesh*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，利用大型语言模型（LLM）来估计位置偏差，以解决推荐和搜索系统中学习排序模型中的位置偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐和搜索系统中，由于用户倾向于点击排名较高的项目，导致交互数据存在位置偏差。这使得新模型继承并加强了先前排序模型的偏差，而不是真正提高相关性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）应用于记录的用户交互数据来估计位置偏差。这种方法为在线实验提供了一种经济高效的替代方案。

Result: 使用LLM估计的倾向性得分在不同得分桶中是稳定的，并揭示了Viator网格布局的行-列效应。使用这些倾向性得分训练的IPS加权重新排序器在标准NDCG@10上与生产模型匹配，同时将加权NDCG@10提高了约2%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，使用LLM估计位置偏差是有效的，并且可以在离线评估中获得收益。

Abstract: Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models
trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance.
However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are
more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of
their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and
reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving
relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity
Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a
propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given
position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,
especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models
(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a
cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that
propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score
buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler
heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities
matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted
NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming
live-traffic experiments.

*Anushya Subbiah,Vikram Aggarwal,James Pine,Steffen Rendle,Krishna Sayana,Kun Su*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法，将item IDs作为LLM中的一等公民，从而提高推荐质量和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推荐方法难以处理大规模的item catalogs，并且需要将item tokenize成多个token，这导致了推理效率瓶颈。

Method: 该论文通过简单的训练和推理修改，实现了item的单token表示和单步解码。

Result: 该方法在Amazon购物数据集上，推荐质量（Recall和NDCG）优于现有技术，并且推理效率提高了5-14倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提供了一种新的视角，可以有效地将item IDs集成到LLM中，并为未来的研究开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance
recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item
catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs),
poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text
vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based
recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first
class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into
multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck
in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications.
  Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as
first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective,
novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token
representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows
improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing
techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving
inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective
distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation,
potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for
integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here

TL;DR: 使用微调的LLM自动进行相关性评估，以提高效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注成本高、周期长，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用微调的LLM自动进行相关性评估。

Result: LLM生成的判断与人工标注高度一致，显著提高了评估效率，并降低了在线实验测量中的最小可检测效应（MDE）。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的标注能够扩展查询集、优化抽样设计，并大规模评估更广泛的搜索体验。

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAG系统通过检索到的证据来支持LLM，但会引入LLM可能吸收和复制错误信息的漏洞。本研究系统评估了RAG在健康领域的鲁棒性，并检查了模型输出与真实答案之间的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统容易受到检索到的证据中错误信息的影响，尤其是在包含对抗性材料时。由于不正确的回答可能造成伤害，因此本文关注健康领域。

Method: 使用常见的健康问题进行对照实验，改变检索文档的类型和组成（有帮助的、有害的和对抗性的），以及用户问题的框架（一致的、中性的和不一致的）。

Result: 对抗性文档会显著降低对齐效果，但当检索池中也存在有用的证据时，可以保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在设计高风险领域的更安全的RAG系统时，需要检索保障措施。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

Motivation: 解决传统 NER 方法依赖固定模式或微调模型的问题，探索利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的内部表示进行开放域实体类型检索。

Method: 利用 LLM 的中间层 Transformer 块的 Value Vectors 编码细粒度的类型信息，并训练对比投影网络对齐类型兼容的实体，分离不相关的类型。

Result: NER Retriever 在三个基准测试中显著优于词汇和密集句子级检索基线。

Conclusion: 该研究为 LLM 中表征选择提供了经验支持，并展示了一种可扩展的、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Result: 在 RAG-EDA 和 Rust-Docs-QA 两个公共数据集上，Technical-Embeddings 显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 集成查询扩展和上下文总结可以有效提高技术领域的信息访问和理解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product
development workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于静态兴趣偏好的个性化内容生成策略难以满足互联网应用中用户兴趣的动态演变和日益增长的多模态需求。

Method: 该模型通过对用户兴趣的长期时间演变进行建模，并捕获具有强时间依赖性的动态兴趣表示来实现。同时，该模型支持融合文本、图像、视频和音频等多模态特征，并根据多模态偏好提供定制内容。

Result: TIMGen模型能够灵活、动态地建模用户的多模态兴趣，更好地理解和捕捉他们的兴趣和偏好，克服了基于静态偏好的个性化内容推荐方法的缺点。

Conclusion: TIMGen模型可以扩展到各种实际应用场景，包括电子商务、广告、在线教育和精准医疗，为未来的研究提供见解。

Abstract: With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal
demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies
based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application
requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal
Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal
evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations
with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of
multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers
customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns
temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest
representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content
needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation
methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of
users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests
and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application
scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision
medicine, providing insights for future research.

Result: 在各种下游任务的离线和在线环境中，都取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架已部署在Pinterest的生产广告排序系统中，并在在线指标上获得了显著收益。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的图像检索系统主要采用全局到局部的方法，但这种方法会遗漏局部匹配。新兴的高效局部特征搜索方法和全局特征重排序为新的检索方式提供了可能。

Method: 提出了一种局部到全局的检索范式，其中全局特征是基于局部特征检索的相似性进行计算的。利用多维缩放技术创建嵌入，从而实现显著的重排序提升。

Result: 在Revisited Oxford和Paris数据集上取得了新的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: 实验证明了该方法具有可靠的检索性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

Motivation: 从几何角度出发，并使用诱导度量，开发了一种新的优化器，并将其与现有的方法进行了比较。

Method: 通过采用几何视角并使用诱导度量。

Result: 这种新的优化器类在低维示例中非常有效，并且相对于用于训练神经网络的最新方法提供了略微的改进。

Conclusion: 这些新的优化器具有理论上理想的属性。

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EHR人工智能模型通用性和实用性有限。

Method: 该模型采用了一种新的基于时间令牌的学习框架，可将患者的动态时间线显式编码到模型结构中，以支持对临床序列的时间推理。

Result: CEHR-GPT在所有三个任务中均表现出强大的性能，并通过词汇扩展和微调有效地推广到外部数据集。

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT具有多功能性，无需针对特定任务进行重新训练，即可实现快速模型开发、队列发现和患者结果预测。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

Result: PCC可以稳定估计NMF的有效秩，解决NMF非识别问题。NMF可以近似实现PCC，用于聚类和数据去噪。

Conclusion: NMF和PCC之间存在互补关系，可以相互促进

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Motivation: 联邦学习 (FL) 有效地促进了物联网 (IoT) 场景中具有隐私考虑的分布式客户端之间的协作训练。除了数据异构性之外，FL 客户端还可能受到有限的能量和可用性预算的限制。因此，有效选择参与训练的客户端对于全局模型的收敛和客户端贡献的平衡至关重要。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SharedRep-RLHF框架，以解决MaxMin-RLHF在少数群体上的表现不佳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的从人类反馈中进行强化学习的方法无法捕捉不同人群的意见差异，并且MaxMin-RLHF在最小奖励群体是少数群体时表现不佳。

Method: SharedRep-RLHF学习并利用各群体注释中的共享特征，而不是为各群体学习单独的奖励模型。

Result: 在多个自然语言任务上的实验表明，与MaxMin-RLHF相比，SharedRep-RLHF的胜率提高了20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF在学习共享特征方面优于MaxMin-RLHF，并且在实际应用中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统供应链中效率损失、中小企业融资难、风险传递等问题，促进高质量发展。

Method: 结合交易成本理论、信息不对称理论，利用随机森林、LSTM、聚类/回归算法、博弈论、强化学习和XGBoost等机器学习技术，构建数据驱动的三维分析框架，并采用“核心企业信用赋能+动态质押融资”的FSCM模型。

Conclusion: 该SCM-FSCM模型有效降低了运营成本，缓解了融资约束，并支持了高质量的供应链发展。

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了直接跟踪梯度动态的重要性，旨在弥合理论预期和经验行为之间的差距，并为未来的优化研究提供见解。

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型不断增长，利用来自无线设备的地理分布式数据变得越来越重要，从而产生了联邦基础模型 (FFM)。最近，FM 已经发展成为能够跨多个任务处理各种模态的多模态多任务 (M3T) FM（例如，GPT-4），这激发了一种新的未被充分探索的范例：M3T FFM。

Method: HF-FMs 战略性地调整 M3T FM 的模块化结构，包括模态编码器、提示、混合专家 (MoE)、适配器和任务头，以及雾/边缘基础设施的分层性质。此外，HF-FM 允许选择使用设备到设备 (D2D) 通信，从而在可行时实现节点之间的水平模块中继和本地化协作训练。

Conclusion: 为了展示它们的潜力，我们在无线网络环境中对 HF-FM 进行了原型设计，并发布了 HF-FM 开发的开源代码，旨在促进对这一未开发领域的探索。

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

Motivation: Navigating and understanding the vast collection of post-trained LLMs is challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.

Method: Represent finetuned models as vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to a base model.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EmbedOR算法，改进SNE算法在高维数据可视化上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNE算法（如UMAP和tSNE）在处理噪声和高维数据时，无法保持数据的几何结构，可能错误地分离连接的组件，且难以发现聚类数据中的集群。

Method: 引入离散图曲率，使用曲率增强的距离度量随机嵌入数据，强调潜在的聚类结构。

Result: EmbedOR能更好地保持数据的连续性，减少数据碎片化。

Conclusion: EmbedOR算法在可视化和几何结构保持方面表现出色，其距离度量可用于注释现有可视化，以识别碎片并提供对数据几何结构的深入了解。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个在线学习问题，旨在为一系列受试者寻找最佳测试策略，每个受试者都可以通过从一个公共池中抽取的一系列候选测试进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当测试相关且成本高昂时，最好只选择一个子集并在部分信息下做出决策。当受试者未被完全测试时，由此产生的缺失数据会使估计产生偏差，使得该问题从根本上比标准情景 MDP 更难。

Method: 我们提出了一个 Explore-Then-Commit 算法，其累积后悔值为 $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$，适用于离散和高斯分布。

Result: 我们证明了 minimax 后悔值必须至少以 $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ 的速度缩放，这与情景 MDP 中的 $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ 速率形成对比，揭示了缺失性引入的困难。对于在线成本敏感的最大熵采样问题，我们提出了一个迭代消除算法，该算法实现了 $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ 的后悔值，打破了 OTP 的 $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ 下界。

Conclusion: 这项工作加深了对缺失数据下探索-利用权衡的理解，并指导了高效的序列测试策略的设计。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可微的范围分割熵估计器，它可以使算法适应其输入的“有序性”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围分割熵在算法设计中提供了强大的保证，但尚未被深度学习所用。

Method: 1. 提出了范围分割熵的可微近似，使其可用作可训练的损失或正则化器; 2. 设计了EntropyNet，一个将数据重构为低熵形式的神经模块，以加速下游实例最优算法; 3. 通过将熵正则化直接应用于Transformer注意力，将这一原理扩展到几何之外。

Result: 在各种任务中，可微熵提高了效率，且不降低正确性：在几何中，该方法实现了高达4.1倍的运行时加速，误差可忽略不计（<0.2%）；在深度学习中，它诱导了结构化的注意力模式，与L1基线相比，在80%的稀疏性下，准确率提高了6%。

Conclusion: 熵界计算不仅在理论上是优雅的，而且是自适应学习、效率和结构化表示的实用机制。

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

Motivation: 尽管柏拉图表示假设表明神经网络在不同架构中会收敛到相似的表示，但神经算子的表示特性仍未得到充分探索，尽管它们在科学计算中的重要性日益提高。

Method: 比较了 SAE、lifted-SAE 和 SAE 神经算子的推理和训练动态。

Result: 重点介绍了提升和算子模块如何引入有益的归纳偏差，从而实现更快的恢复、改进的平滑概念恢复以及跨不同分辨率的稳健推理，这是神经算子独有的属性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个用于统一神经模型表示的稀疏模型恢复框架，并通过实验验证了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中于新的模型架构和训练算法来处理稀缺的训练数据，而不是直接对数据条件进行建模。因此，科学家和政策制定者不确定是否以及如何收集额外的数据以最大限度地提高性能。

Method: 提出了第一个在存在异构数据收集成本和实际预算约束的情况下优化空间训练数据的问题公式，以及解决该问题的新方法。

Result: 在模拟不同问题设置的实验中，我们的策略揭示了样本优化带来的巨大收益。进一步的实验划定了优化抽样特别有效的设置。

Conclusion: 我们引入的问题公式和方法旨在推广到SatML的各个应用领域；我们特别强调一个特定的问题设置，我们的合作者可以直接使用我们的发现来增强多哥的集群农业调查，以进行SatML监测。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Conclusion: 对抗性共同进化是一种强大的方法，可以学习工具性世界模型，从而推动智能体走向更大的战略深度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

Motivation: 研究奖励函数的哪些基本属性能够实现高效的稀疏奖励强化学习

Method: Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)

Result: PAMC在超过一半的系统抽样领域中发现了可利用的结构，与强探索、结构化和表征学习基线相比，PAMC将样本效率提高了1.6到2.1倍，而计算开销仅增加了约20%。

Conclusion: 结构化奖励学习是一种有前景的新范例，对机器人、医疗保健和其他安全关键、样本昂贵的应用具有直接影响。

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

Motivation: 现有的时间序列在线学习方法在应对数据分布偏移时存在不足，尤其是在数据 последовательно 到达的在线部署场景中。

Result: 实验结果表明，ADAPT-Z在多个数据集上优于标准基线模型和现有在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地解决时间序列预测中的分布偏移和延迟反馈问题。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于激光雷达的机器学习框架，用于将室内表面分类为半镜面和低镜面类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和亚太赫兹网络中的可靠连接依赖于周围表面的反射，因为高频信号很容易被阻挡。表面的散射行为不仅取决于材料的介电常数，还取决于粗糙度，粗糙度决定了能量是保持在镜面方向还是漫散射。

Method: 使用光学反射率作为电磁散射行为的代表，使用激光雷达驱动的机器学习框架将室内表面分类为半镜面和低镜面类别。收集了来自 15 种代表性室内材料的超过 78,000 个点的数据集，并将其划分为 3 厘米 x 3 厘米的patch，以便能够从部分视图进行分类。提取了捕获几何和强度的patch级特征，包括仰角、自然对数标度强度和最大值与平均值之比，并用于训练随机森林、XGBoost 和神经网络分类器。

Result: 结果表明，集成树模型始终在准确性和鲁棒性之间提供最佳折衷方案，这证实了激光雷达衍生的特征捕获了粗糙度引起的散射效应。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成散射感知环境地图和数字孪生，支持下一代网络中的自适应波束管理、阻塞恢复和环境感知连接。

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

reduction through autoencoders, followed by a dense network. The features are
related to traffic accident data and the target is to classify accident
severity. Our experiments show cross-validated results of up to 92% accuracy

Motivation: 研究动机是解决数据科学中的基本问题之一：社区发现，即如何将节点划分为不相交的社区。

Method: 该方法将CPM重新解释为一个潜在的享乐博弈，通过将全局哈密顿量分解为局部效用函数，并证明了通过更好地响应动态的CPM目标局部优化在伪多项式时间内收敛到平衡分区。同时，引入并关联了两个稳定性标准：一个基于鲁棒性新概念的严格标准，以及一个基于这些目标加权和的松弛效用函数。

Result: 在社区跟踪场景中，使用初始分区来引导Leiden算法与部分地面真实信息，实验表明，鲁棒分区在恢复地面真实社区方面产生更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 鲁棒分区在恢复地面真实社区方面产生更高的准确性。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用现代车辆中日益增多的传感器数据，并利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在任务中的适应性和推理能力。然而，MLLM 本质上缺乏三维空间理解。

Method: 通过收集邻近车辆的传感数据构建环境的 BEV，然后将该 BEV 表示与自车输入融合，为大型语言模型提供空间上下文。

Result: 在三个 V2I 链路预测任务（视距（LoS）与非视距（NLoS）分类、链路可用性和阻塞预测）中，所提出的 BEV 注入框架始终提高了性能。与仅使用自车信息的基线相比，该方法在准确率指标的宏平均值上提高了高达 13.9%。在具有挑战性的雨天和夜间条件下，性能提升高达 32.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架在恶劣环境中具有鲁棒性，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Conclusion: 该方法可以从不同但结构相似的任务中推断奖励，而无需事先了解底层环境或修改平均场博弈模型本身。

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

Motivation: 现有的KD和QAT工作主要集中在通过设计更好的KD损失函数或优化QAT的前向和后向传播来提高量化模型的准确性，但对输入转换（如数据增强（DA））的影响关注有限。量化感知KD和DA之间的关系仍未被探索。

Result: 通过广泛的评估表明，使用我们的指标选择DA策略可以显著提高各种模型架构和数据集上的最先进的QAT和KD工作。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的DA选择指标，可以有效提高量化感知训练和知识蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the

fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to

TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Motivation: 在医疗保健应用中，机器学习 (ML) 模型的使用在过去十年中迅速增加。尽管性能很高，但现代 ML 模型并不总是能捕捉到最终用户需要的模式。例如，在所有其他特征固定的情况下，模型可能会预测癌症分期与生存率之间非单调递减的关系。

Method: 通过调查收集临床知识，通过约束将其整合到 ML 模型中。通过随机实验，检查反馈驱动的对齐方法在非生成 AI 临床风险预测模型中的可行性。

Result: 该方法表明，在不影响性能的情况下，使 ML 模型与临床经验学习保持一致是可能的。通过使用提出的方法引出临床医生的模型偏好，约束模型和非约束模型对患者的预测差异越大，临床解释的差异就越明显。

Conclusion: 通过整合临床知识和采用反馈驱动的对齐方法，可以在不影响性能的情况下，提高 ML 模型在医疗保健应用中的临床可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习方法 FedQuad，旨在解决客户端数据异构性带来的挑战，尤其是在数据集规模有限和类别不平衡的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习由于其分布式数据和保护隐私的特性而备受欢迎，但客户端之间的数据异构性给全局模型的泛化带来了挑战，尤其是在数据集规模有限和类别不平衡的情况下。

Method: 该方法通过显式优化客户端内部类内方差更小和类间方差更大，从而减少模型聚合对客户端表示上全局模型的负面影响。FedQuad 最小化相似对之间的距离，同时最大化负对之间的距离，从而有效分离共享特征空间中的客户端数据。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 和 CIFAR-100 数据集上，通过各种数据分布和大量客户端的评估，证明了该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文详细分析了有监督和联邦学习范例中基于度量学习的策略，强调了它们在解决联邦环境中表征学习挑战方面的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的置信区间构建方法，通过合成数据提升 counterfactual 推断的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实推断方法在处理不平衡数据时，区间过于保守。

Method: 利用预训练的反事实模型生成合成数据，并结合风险控制预测集进行校准。

Result: 提出的 SP-CCI 方法在保证覆盖率的同时，缩小了预测区间。

Conclusion: SP-CCI 在不同数据集上都能有效减少区间宽度。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了算法追索中的不公平性问题，提出了一个基于社会负担的公平框架MISOB，并实验证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感决策应用中，机器学习预测越来越多地被使用，并且新兴立法要求分类器在给出否定决策时，必须提供可操作的步骤来逆转该结果。然而，追索过程本身的公平性存在问题。

Method: 本文对算法追索中的不公平性进行了全面的理论刻画，正式连接了追索和分类中的公平性保证，并强调了标准等成本范式的局限性。然后，引入了一个基于社会负担的新的公平框架。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，MISOB 降低了所有群体的社会负担，且不影响整体分类器精度。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个算法追索中不公平性的整体理论表征，并提出了一个实用的算法MISOB，可以在真实条件下广泛应用，以减少所有群体的社会负担，且不影响整体分类器精度。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为TAGAL的表格数据生成方法，它利用大型语言模型(llm)进行自动迭代，并通过反馈来改进生成的数据，无需额外的llm训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高机器学习任务的性能，通常采用生成数据的方法，包括训练分类模型。本文旨在提出一种新的表格数据生成方法。

Method: TAGAL使用agentic工作流，利用大型语言模型(llm)进行自动迭代，并通过反馈来改进生成的数据，无需任何进一步的llm训练。llm的使用还允许在生成过程中添加外部知识。

Result: TAGAL在各种数据集上进行了评估，并从不同方面评估了生成数据的质量。结果表明，TAGAL能够与需要llm训练的最新方法相媲美，并且通常优于其他无训练方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，agentic工作流具有潜力，并为基于llm的数据生成方法开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

### [191] [Attention as an Adaptive Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154)
*Peter Racioppo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了自适应滤波器注意力机制（AFA），该机制将可学习的动力学模型直接融入到注意力权重的计算中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的注意力机制直接比较查询和键，而本文将输入序列建模为线性随机微分方程（SDE）的离散观测值。

Method: 通过施加具有同时对角化状态矩阵和噪声协方差的线性动力学模型，利用微分 Lyapunov 方程的闭式解来有效地传播成对不确定性。注意力自然地产生为该线性 SDE 的最大似然解，其注意力权重对应于传播的成对精度的鲁棒残差重加权。

Result: 对状态矩阵的特征值施加额外的约束，可以得到一个简化的变体，其计算和内存复杂度与标准注意力相同。在动力学和过程噪声消失的极限情况下，并使用小角度近似，可以恢复普通的点积注意力。

Conclusion: AFA机制是一种新颖的注意力机制，它将可学习的动力学模型融入到注意力权重的计算中，并且在特定条件下可以简化为标准注意力或点积注意力。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Motivation: 探索语音自监督模型在非语音数据上的有效性，特别是在生物声学领域。

Method: 使用HuBERT、WavLM和XEUS等模型生成动物声音的潜在表征，并通过线性探测和下游架构分析模型属性。

Result: 结果表明，这些模型在生物声学任务中具有竞争力，尤其是在噪声鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 语音自监督学习有潜力成为推动生物声学研究的有效框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列预测模型中的成员推理攻击 (MIA) 问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 MIA 在分类模型中得到了广泛研究，但其对时间序列预测的影响在很大程度上尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文提出了两种新的攻击方法：(1) 将多元 LiRA 调整到时间序列预测环境，(2) 一种名为深度时间序列 (DTS) 攻击的端到端学习方法。同时，本文还将这些方法与分类环境中其他领先攻击的调整版本进行了比较。

Result: 在 TUH-EEG 和 ELD 数据集上，针对 LSTM 和 N-HiTS 两种预测架构，在记录和用户级别威胁模型下进行了评估。结果表明，预测模型是脆弱的，用户级别的攻击通常能实现完美的检测。所提出的方法在某些设置中实现了最强的性能。脆弱性随着预测范围的延长和训练人群的减少而增加。

Conclusion: 时间序列预测模型容易受到成员推理攻击，并且本文提出的方法为时间序列预测中的隐私风险评估建立了新的基线。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归下一个token预测语言模型在推理时计算和内存成本高昂，实际部署面临挑战。

Method: SBD允许模型并行采样多个未来token，并利用离散扩散文献中的高级求解器。

Result: 在Llama-3.1 8B和Qwen-3 8B上进行微调，SBD能够在实现与等效NTP训练相同性能的同时，将生成所需的正向传递次数减少3-5倍。

Conclusion: SBD无需架构更改或额外的训练超参数，保持与精确KV缓存的兼容性，并且可以通过微调现有的下一个token预测模型来实现。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

TL;DR: 提出了ZooCast，通过构建统一的嵌入空间，动态选择最佳模型进行预测，从而利用不同时间序列基础模型的互补能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同的时间序列基础模型对不同的时间模式有偏好，没有一个模型在所有情况下都表现最好。如何利用这些模型的互补能力是一个重要的问题。

Method: 提出了One-Embedding-Fits-All范式，构建统一的表示空间，用单个嵌入表示模型，从而实现高效的相似度匹配。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval零样本预测基准测试中表现出色，并保持了单个时间序列基础模型的效率。在实际场景中，可以无缝添加新模型，以较低的开销逐步提高准确性。

Conclusion: ZooCast能够有效地集成和利用不同的时间序列基础模型，并在实际应用中具有良好的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法来评估降维算法在保留预期聚类结构方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的降维质量指标不能解释为什么预期的结构会丢失。可视化分析解决方案可能会有所帮助，但由于超参数空间巨大，通常很耗时。

Method: 该论文引入了两个有监督的指标，精确率和召回率，以评估关系阶段。这些指标量化了建模关系与基于代表该结构的某些标签集的预期聚类结构的一致程度。

Result: 作者使用 t-SNE 和 UMAP 说明了它们的应用，并通过各种使用场景验证了该方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可以指导超参数调整，发现投影伪影，并确定预期结构是否在关系中被捕获，从而使 DR 过程更快、更可靠。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

Motivation: 当前序列模型（如Mamba和Transformer）的长期依赖建模能力缺乏理论研究，阻碍了对这一方面的系统性改进。

Method: 本文通过past inputs对hidden states的导数来定义长期依赖关系，并在此基础上比较了SSM和Transformer模型建模长期依赖关系的能力。

Result: SSM的长期依赖性随序列长度呈指数衰减，而Transformer中的注意力机制更灵活，理论上在充足的训练数据、计算资源和适当的训练下，可以更好地建模长期依赖关系。

Conclusion: 为了结合注意力机制的长期依赖灵活性和SSM的计算效率，本文提出了一种新的SSM隐藏状态更新公式，并证明了其在标准高斯分布输入数据下的稳定性。

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖于启发式噪声分配策略，缺乏对其理论基础的严格理解，无法将噪声分配与形式化的隐私-效用权衡联系起来。

Method: 提出了一种信噪比一致的噪声分配策略，统一了层间信噪比一致性和高效利用隐私预算。

Result: 在集中式和联邦学习设置中的大量实验表明，该方法始终优于现有的分配策略，实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了对先前方法的诊断性见解，而且为在深度模型中设计自适应和有效的噪声注入方案提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

Result: 研究发现，遗忘程度取决于分布偏移，分布偏移通过在新任务上评估的微调策略和基本策略之间的KL散度来衡量。On-policy RL 隐式地偏向于 KL 最小的解决方案，而 SFT 可能收敛到与基本模型相差甚远的分布。

Conclusion: 论文提出了“RL’s Razor”原则：在所有解决新任务的方法中，RL 倾向于选择与原始模型 KL 散度最小的方法。

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

Motivation: 现有的交互式多目标优化（MOO）方法在差分隐私中效率低下，因为它们无法利用问题的独特结构：Pareto前沿上的点可以通过最大化固定隐私级别的精度来直接生成。

Method: 1. 从理论上推导出权衡的形状，从而可以直接有效地对Pareto前沿进行建模。2. 用更具信息量的交互代替成对比较，向用户展示假设的权衡曲线，并要求他们选择自己喜欢的权衡。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的差分隐私逻辑回归和深度迁移学习实验表明，该方法以明显更低的计算成本和用户交互收敛到最佳隐私-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法优于基线。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.
