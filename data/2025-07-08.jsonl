Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome\nhand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face\nlimitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how\nLLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.\nThough promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly\nincluding high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost\nand suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token\nsequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical\nfeatures.\n  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to\nalleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \\textbf{LLM4Hint}\nthat leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization\nhints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model\nto produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the\nSQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously\nreducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting\nstrategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the\nbackbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit\nmatching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight\nmodel, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show\nthat LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the\nquery statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in\nterms of both effectiveness and generalization."}

However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance\ntradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while\nmaintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when\ntransferred across diverse VLMs and tasks.

Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos.

However, existing\nLLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information\ninherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental\narchitectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention\nmechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings\ndesigned primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.\nThis limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of\nuser preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\n  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal\nFramework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal\ninference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact\nof temporal information on recommendation outcomes.

While\ncomputational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease\ndetection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and\nbiases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and\nexpert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and\nthe cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial\nnoise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,\ntransformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels\nwith a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from\nEHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the\nscope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning\nembeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence\npatterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level\nrepresentations via a multi-layer transformer architecture.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale).

We prove this through a\nthree-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal\napproximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of\npractical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we\nprove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional\nto the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any\ntheoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the\nability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the\ndense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical\nNecessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is\nempirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing\nany successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities.

However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias.

To address\nthis gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the\nperformance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic\nconstraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of\nmaking a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining\nfrom a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the\nperformance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from\nthe MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better\naccuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds\n\\$0.01.

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation.

These selected bands were fed\ninto a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract\nspatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten\nclassical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,\nAdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and\nminimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and\ncross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA\nhighlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were\ndeployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral\nleaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification\nresults. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,\ncontributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the\ntraining dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease\nstages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and\nbroader crop applicability."}

However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus\non natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity\nand ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval\nmodule, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and\ndynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.\nThis Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a\nMixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to\nenhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test\ntime. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate\nthe original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,\nforming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG.

We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box\ntesting technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable\nagent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training\nflaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse\nenvironmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying\nconfigurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling.

We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts.

We further enrich and debias these signals\nthrough lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random\ntrace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter\nPreference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,\nenabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly\non these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on\nQwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate\nthat ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,\nTB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF\npresents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs\nthrough autonomous reward modeling."}

The effect of regional consistency on\nclassification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data\nare two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects.

This high-precision distillation pipeline is used\nto train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve\nevery instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch\npre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms\nmodels trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse\ndownstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on\nlighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer\ntraining tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text\nquality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches\nsuch as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a\nscalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in\nmodern LLM pipelines."}

We introduce\nWETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT\ndetection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia\neditors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,\nSummarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new\ndatasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three\nprompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing\nprompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,\ntraining-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot\ndetectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in\nrealistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such\nmodels on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in\neditor-driven contexts."}

Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked\nTemporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space\ntemporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages\na learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,\nthereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By\nintegrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end\ntraining tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,\nwe introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action\ngeneration space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to\nprioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end\nstates over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out\ntask-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action\nsequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on\nmost metrics.

As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for\nstreamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or\ncost-sensitive settings.

We demonstrate its efficacy by\nrecovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from\nnoise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of\nthe dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is\ncorrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that\nthis method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct\nsymbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount\nof data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method\nderives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as\nnetwork sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing\nyet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving\nmicroscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent\nrelationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and\nsynchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three\nintracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,\nprefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to\ndevelop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse\nneural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and\nmacroscale brain activity."}

Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies\npresent significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'\ncapabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),\nparticularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the\nprimary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,\nvision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into\na format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,\na deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to\nclassify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The\nViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with\nengineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and\nlocalization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning\ntechniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method\nachieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR\ndataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by\ngenerating bounding boxes around the regions of interest.

We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically\ncombining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs\ngenerate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,\nreasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts\nto the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables\nthe LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final\nanswer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG\noffers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs.

Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the\nEST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By\nmaintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST\nachieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively\nbreaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on\nthe STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,\ndemonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of\nthese tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an\neffective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard\nTransformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data\nscenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks."}

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases.

However, existing\nLLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information\ninherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental\narchitectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention\nmechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings\ndesigned primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.\nThis limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of\nuser preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\n  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal\nFramework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal\ninference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact\nof temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal\norder as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can\nquantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing\nwhat recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while\nkeeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to\ndesign a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the\nmodel's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute\ntimestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our\ncounterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively\nenhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were\ninteracted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between\nitems)."}

Despite\nthe remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their\nperformance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not\nbeen comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text\neffectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial\nbottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six\nLLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),\nand ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including\nzero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using\nthe ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference\ntimes is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization\nquality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a\nsentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows\nto summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while\nLLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long\nscientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.\nIn addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model\nparameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer\nactionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,\ncontributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems."}

In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results\nreveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,\nunderscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms\nfor LLM agents."}

Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can\nlead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework\nwith an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize\nunlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets\ndemonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves\nthe performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and\n(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD\nimages leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS\noutperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,\nrespectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes\nabundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this\nwork can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS"}

In long-term planning tasks,\nhowever, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize\nplanning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to\nanalyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules\nthat improve future behavior.

To address this issue, we propose\nSmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained\ncontrol over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each\nindividual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a\nshort-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length\nControl Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,\nwhich increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while\nreducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core\ncomponents: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward\nfunction, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a\ndifficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components\nenable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.\nEmpirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone\nmodels demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning\nwhile achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods."}

In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a\nbootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning\nthe scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's\nability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful\nway despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types\nmaterialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length\ntraffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that\nenable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct\nscenario categories.

In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is\noften necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space\nbased on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps\nin unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying\nmodels. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising\ndata while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time\nand memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the\ntransformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original\ndata. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and\nglobal shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in\nterms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the\nobjective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering\nguided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to\nserve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the\noriginal data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that\nmeasure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,\nrespectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of\ndatasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.\nResults reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic\ncomplexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and\ndifferent choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric."}

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details.

Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,\nusing both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques\neffectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary.

To achieve this, we propose\nObject-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided\nVisual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with\ncorresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation\nstrategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation\n(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To\neffectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation\nmetric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance\nacross various metrics.

To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our\napproach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive\nscore aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set.

By bridging gesture modeling and\nspatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing\nresearch in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.\n  Project page: https://groundedgestures.github.io/"}

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that\ntokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater\nimportance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our\nmethod results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to\nlayer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,\nwhile also achieving superior performance on LongBench."}

Traditionally, estimating item\ndifficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,\nfollowed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty\nestimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for\npreviously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated\nStudents Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with\ninstructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the\ndifficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct\npreference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how\nlikely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by\ngenerating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring\nmodel, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty\nestimates.

In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune\nchannels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive\nframework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected\nlayers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in\neach iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined\nnumber of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods\nand estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in\nthe validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy\ndrops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a\nset of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these\nlayers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these\nselected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the\ndeep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),\nin which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel\npruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and\npseudo-labelled samples from the target domain.

Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance\nmodel robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during\ntraining and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we\nintroduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.\nUnlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model\narchitecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal\ncontrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.\nThis process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both\nmodels, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the\nintrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically\nmeaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on\nseveral benchmark datasets."}

In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the\ninteractions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent\npredictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in\ntheir problem formulation but also in the model architectures and\nimplementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,\nwe systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,\nincluding post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the\nmodel for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We\nevaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and\ninference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and\nlimitations of each approach.

Hu and Y. Wang contribute equally", "summary": "Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on\nevaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another\ncritical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and\nretrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of\nbenchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results\nreveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,\nunderscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms\nfor LLM agents."}
