TL;DR: 这篇论文结合了Foursquare和OpenStreetMap (OSM) 的优势，利用Foursquare作为全面的商业POI基线，OSM作为丰富的元数据来源。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foursquare数据集中缺少完整的元数据，而OSM虽然详细但未正式验证POI是否代表实际业务。

Method: 通过计算Foursquare和OSM POI之间的名称相似度得分和空间距离来实现记录链接，从而识别并保留高置信度的匹配项。

Result: 构建了一个结合了两方数据的POI的图表示，从而实现高级空间分析和一系列下游应用。过滤后的数据集大小为631GB。

Conclusion: 该方法集成了Foursquare和OSM的优势，创建了一个更丰富、更实用的POI数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Foursquare released a global dataset with more than 100 million
points of interest (POIs), each representing a real-world business on its
platform. However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or
categories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In
contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with
detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify
whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a
methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a
comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched
metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full
version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable
thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download
and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce
the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity
scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures
identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses
in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.
Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation
of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial
analyses and a range of downstream applications.
