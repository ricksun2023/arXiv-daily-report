Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

TL;DR: RxBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型在处方审核中表现的综合基准，它涵盖了常见的处方审核类别，并包含了14种常见的处方错误类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的应用，特别是在处方审核方面的能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含单选题、多选题和简答题的基准测试，所有题目都经过经验丰富的临床药师审核。对18个先进的大型语言模型进行了基准测试，并根据任务对性能进行了分层。

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, 和 DeepSeek-R1-0528 在准确性和稳健性方面始终处于领先地位。在某些任务中，领先的LLM可以与持证药剂师的表现相匹配或超过。

Conclusion: RxBench建立了一个标准化的、面向错误类型的框架，不仅揭示了前沿LLM在处方审核中的能力和局限性，而且为构建更可靠和专业的临床工具提供了基础资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

TL;DR: ADORE: A self-sustaining framework enhances e-commerce search relevance by synergizing rule-aware discrimination, error-type-aware data synthesis, and key-attribute-enhanced knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic gaps in term-matching methods and neural models' reliance on scarce domain-specific hard samples.

Method: Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module, and Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module.

Result: Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE.

Conclusion: ADORE establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个模型选择方法(MSM)，以指导在特定用例中选择最合适的LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速发展的大语言模型领域，为特定应用选择最合适的模型变得越来越复杂。

Method: 通过分析当前的排行榜和基准，着重关注医学领域的案例研究，展示定量评估维度的演变、现状和实际意义。

Result: 论文提出了一个模型选择方法(MSM)。

Conclusion: MSM旨在指导LLM的导航、优先级排序和选择，使其与给定的用例最佳对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的扩散语言模型推理框架，通过利用历史信息来提高生成质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理方法依赖于局部指标，缺乏可靠的视角，导致生成质量下降。

Method: 提出了Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD) 框架，包含轨迹修正机制和自适应采样策略。

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA等基准测试中，推理速度提高3.48倍，性能提高3.91%。

Conclusion: CCD框架能够有效提高扩散语言模型的生成质量和速度。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一种用于LLM的内存高效、可逆架构，灵感来源于对称和辛微分方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的训练既昂贵又耗时，因此通常对LLM进行微调以解决特定任务。

Method: 该模型使用时间可逆动力学来检索反向传播期间的隐藏状态，从而无需存储激活。

Result: 结果表明，在多个数据集和基准测试中，以及在多个LLM上，性能相当或有所提高。

Conclusion: 该方法为降低与从头开始训练和微调LLM相关的内存和计算成本构建了一条可扩展且高效的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

### [7] [Towards Unification of Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02772)
*Weihang Su,Jianming Long,Changyue Wang,Shiyu Lin,Jingyan Xu,Ziyi Ye,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)经常出现幻觉，生成的内容流畅连贯但事实不正确。为了解决这个问题，出现了两种不同的研究范式：以模型为中心的幻觉检测(HD)和以文本为中心的事实验证(FV)。我们介绍了UniFact，它通过动态生成模型输出和相应的事实标签，实现了FV和HD之间的直接的、实例级的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的幻觉会降低信任度，并阻碍它们在现实世界中的应用。HD和FV使用不同的假设、数据集和评估协议，这种分离阻碍了它们的集体进步。

Method: 我们提出了一个统一的评估框架UniFact，它能够直接、实例级地比较FV和HD，通过动态生成模型输出和相应的事实标签来实现。

Result: (1)没有哪个范式是普遍优越的；(2)HD和FV捕捉到事实错误的互补方面；(3)集成这两种方法的混合方法始终能达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 综合实验结果表明，需要一个新的、综合的研究议程，以统一llm中的幻觉检测和事实验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探索了用于语音模型微调的内存高效微调 (MEFT) 方法，以解决方言识别 (DI) 任务中计算成本高和内存需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语音信号中识别同一种语言的不同方言的任务。微调语音模型进行方言识别成本高，计算量大，内存需求大。

Method: 将最初为语言处理提出的 MEFT 方法应用于通用预训练语音模型 Whisper，并分析了基于各种 MEFT 方法的 GPU 内存使用情况和微调速度。

Result: 在 KeSpeech 数据集上微调 Whisper 模型以识别六种普通话方言，与原始微调和 PEFT 方法相比，GPU 内存使用量减少了高达 73.25%，训练速度提高了 2.1 倍，同时保持了相当的准确率。

Conclusion: MEFT 方法可以显著提高语音模型微调的内存效率和训练速度，同时保持准确率。

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种数据高效的策略，用于在仇恨言论分类上微调 BERT，通过显著减少训练集大小而不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的辱骂性言论构成了一个持续的挑战，原因是不断出现旨在规避检测系统的新型俚语和混淆术语。

Method: 该方法采用基于 TF IDF 的样本选择机制，仅保留最具信息的 75% 的示例，从而最大限度地减少训练开销。为了解决 BERT 的原生词汇表在捕获不断发展的仇恨言论术语方面的局限性，我们使用在辱骂性语境中常见的特定领域俚语和词汇变体来扩充 tokenizer。

Result: 在广泛使用的仇恨言论数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法在提高计算效率的同时，实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展和自适应的辱骂性内容审核的潜力。

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

TL;DR: 现有的剪枝方法在标准LLM上很成功，但严重破坏了RLM。本文介绍了一种自反思结构剪枝框架RESP，通过自生成校准、仅解码梯度重要性估计和渐进式再生，使剪枝决策与模型的推理动态保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少计算和内存成本，通过删除不重要的参数，剪枝提供了一种有希望的解决方案。然而，尽管它们在标准LLM上取得了成功，但现有的剪枝方法严重损害了RLM，因为即使是适度的稀疏性也会降低准确性，并完全扰乱模型的推理连贯性。

Method: 本文介绍了一种自反思结构剪枝框架RESP，该框架通过自生成校准、仅解码梯度重要性估计和渐进式再生，使剪枝决策与模型的推理动态保持一致。

Result: 在GSM8K和MathQA上，RESP明显优于现有的结构化剪枝方法，在20-30%的稀疏度下保持接近密集的精度，并大大减轻了在更高稀疏度下的性能崩溃。在40%的稀疏度下，RESP在GSM8K上达到81.3%的准确率，在MathQA上达到59.6%的准确率，分别超过最强的基线66.87%和47%。

Conclusion: RESP在GSM8K和MathQA上明显优于现有的结构化剪枝方法，在20-30%的稀疏度下保持接近密集的精度，并大大减轻了在更高稀疏度下的性能崩溃。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Method: 该框架采用统计和基于规则的程序，结果是一个基于知识的语言模型，可用于生成和解析目标语言的新语句。研究人员可以控制实验的各个方面。

Result: 实验表明，女儿智能体可以基于包含成人智能体生成的不同数量的范例的训练和测试数据来获取和表示功能和内容类别。在机器生成的数据中也发现了类似于人类生成数据的模式。

Conclusion: 这些实验证实了MODOMA方法在建模语言习得方面的有效性，因为该程序成功地让儿童智能体获得了离散的语法类别。

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

*Alexander Gurung,Nikolay Malkin,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LiteReason的潜在推理方法，它可以与标准token抽样交错，并且易于与RL技术结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过生成长的思维链或“推理轨迹”来处理复杂的任务，这些轨迹在给定查询的情况下充当输出生成中的潜在变量。可以使用强化学习 (RL) 来优化模型生成此类轨迹的能力，以提高它们在预测答案中的效用。这种优化计算成本很高，尤其是对于涉及检索和处理许多token的叙述相关任务。

Method: LiteReason 采用了一个轻量级的推理投影模块，该模块经过训练可以生成连续的潜在token，以帮助模型“跳过”推理步骤。在 RL 期间，策略模型决定何时激活投影仪，根据需要latent和离散推理之间切换。

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成方面的实验结果表明，我们的方法优于latent推理基线，并且可以接近匹配非latent RL 训练，同时将最终推理长度减少 77-92%。

Conclusion: 总体而言，LiteReason 将 RL 训练引导到性能-计算权衡曲线的更有效部分。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

Result: Specificity提高了准确性，特别是对于较小的模型和程序性任务。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了自适应prompt策略的必要性，并提供工具和数据以支持进一步的研究。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate adaptation strategies are important for sustaining food production in response to climate change. Information exists in unstructured and structured data sources.

Method: A structured ScholarGuide prompt improves readability and citation reliability. A consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator is used for robust evaluation.

Result: CAIRNS outperforms baselines on most metrics using an expert-curated question-answer dataset. Ablation studies confirm the results.

Conclusion: CAIRNS enables readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

*Boya Zhang,Alban Bornet,Rui Yang,Nan Liu,Douglas Teodoro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型如何利用上下文信息回答健康问题，以及当上下文信息冲突时，模型的回答会受到怎样的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在长且冲突的生物医学上下文中进行推理的能力。

Method: 使用HealthContradict数据集，该数据集包含920个独特的实例，每个实例包含一个与健康相关的问题、一个由科学证据支持的真实答案和两个呈现矛盾立场的文档。考虑了几个提示设置，包括正确、不正确或矛盾的上下文，并衡量它们对模型输出的影响。

Result: 实验表明，微调的生物医学语言模型的优势不仅在于来自预训练的参数知识，还在于它们利用正确上下文同时抵抗不正确上下文的能力。

Conclusion: HealthContradict数据集能够更好地区分语言模型的上下文推理能力。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型既可以作为问题解决者，也可以作为解决方案验证者。验证者可以通过从候选答案池中选择高质量的答案来提高解决者的性能。我们对 37 个模型进行了系统研究，这些模型跨越了多个系列、大小以及基础模型与后训练变体，并在 9 个基准上进行了评估，涵盖逻辑推理、结构化谜题、符号计算、数学、常识、事实回忆和领域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前对求解器-验证器交互的研究有限，主要集中在自我验证上，很少检查验证器如何判断来自其自身或另一模型系列中的模型的输出。现代大型语言模型也经过了广泛的后训练，但其对验证的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 我们比较了同一系列内的自我验证与验证以及不同系列之间的验证。为了支持这一点，我们引入并通过经验验证了验证器增益，这是一种可以预测来自测试时基于验证器的拒绝采样的性能改进的指标。我们分析了验证器增益和假阳性率等指标如何随模型大小和后训练而变化，并描述了数据集可验证性的差异。

Result: 跨系列验证尤其有效；后训练减少了自我改进，但加强了跨系列改进；数学和逻辑任务表现出最高的固有可验证性。

Conclusion: 跨系列验证尤其有效，后训练减少了自我改进但加强了跨系列改进，数学和逻辑任务表现出最高的固有可验证性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

Conclusion: 本研究为在服务环境中构建可信赖和自适应的 QA 系统提供了一个全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

TL;DR: TaleFrame是一个结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与人机交互（HCI）的系统，通过结构化信息生成故事，实现对生成过程的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故事生成系统由于缺乏细粒度的控制和不明确的输入规范，难以准确地将用户意图转化为令人满意的故事输出，限制了其应用。

Method: 该方法将故事结构分解为四个基本单元：实体、事件、关系和故事大纲。利用Tinystories数据集，解析并构建一个包含9,851个JSON格式条目的偏好数据集，然后用于微调本地Llama模型。采用JSON2Story方法，将结构化数据转换为连贯的故事。TaleFrame还提供直观的界面，支持用户创建和编辑实体和事件，并通过结构化框架生成故事。

Result: 定量评估和用户研究表明TaleFrame的有效性。

Conclusion: TaleFrame通过结合LLMs和HCI，利用结构化信息生成故事，实现了对生成过程的精确控制，并通过用户友好的界面和迭代调整，最终生成令人满意的故事。

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

TL;DR: 本文评估了在线错误信息的两个实际任务：(i) 假新闻检测和 (ii) 在需要快速反应的操作环境中的病毒式传播预测。比较了文本嵌入和轻量级数字特征以及序列模型。结果表明，仅文本内容是假新闻检测的强大判别器，而仅数字管道在语言模型不可用或计算受限时仍然可行。病毒式传播预测比假新闻检测明显更难，并且对标签构建高度敏感。维度降低分析表明，非线性结构比假新闻检测更能提供病毒式传播的信息。

Result: 文本内容是假新闻检测的强大判别器，而仅数字管道在语言模型不可用或计算受限时仍然可行。病毒式传播预测比假新闻检测明显更难，并且对标签构建高度敏感。非线性结构比假新闻检测更能提供病毒式传播的信息。

Conclusion: 讨论了评估设计的意义，并报告了实际影响该领域的可重复性约束。在可能的情况下发布拆分和代码，并为指标选择提供指导。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

Conclusion: The novel synthesis pipeline enables scalable agentic post-training, improving generalization and instruction-following in complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-V3.2, a model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with superior reasoning and agent performance. The key technical breakthroughs of DeepSeek-V3.2 are as follows: (1) DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA): We introduce DSA, an efficient attention mechanism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance in long-context scenarios. (2) Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework: By implementing a robust reinforcement learning protocol and scaling post-training compute, DeepSeek-V3.2 performs comparably to GPT-5. Notably, our high-compute variant, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, surpasses GPT-5 and exhibits reasoning proficiency on par with Gemini-3.0-Pro, achieving gold-medal performance in both the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). (3) Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline: To integrate reasoning into tool-use scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This methodology facilitates scalable agentic post-training, yielding substantial improvements in generalization and instruction-following robustness within complex, interactive environments.

Motivation: 现有方法不加区分地混合正负信号，可能导致模糊的指导和有限的收益。

Method: 使用正向优势样本进行模仿学习，建立稳健的基础，然后引入负向信号来培养区分能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务中取得了稳定和显著的改进，并有效地推广到多模态图形用户界面（GUI）推理场景。

Conclusion: CAPO是一种通用且稳健的优化框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

Method: 构建包含支持、中立和反对三种立场的文章组合，并改变输入顺序，使用 Gemini 2.5 Flash 生成摘要，然后使用 ROUGE-L、BERTScore 和 SummaC 评估摘要的质量。

Result: BERTScore 显示出显著的首因效应，表明摘要在语义上更倾向于与第一个看到的文章对齐。位置 1 与位置 2 和 3 存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型生成的摘要存在风险，因为它们可能不成比例地受到输入顺序的影响，这对于依赖此类摘要的应用和自主人工智能系统尤其重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

TL;DR: 本研究对七种模型合并算法在减少大型语言模型（LLM）中的社会偏见方面进行了实证比较，发现偏见减少与下游任务性能之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会继承和放大预训练语料库中的社会偏见，威胁公平性和社会信任。因此，需要研究减轻社会偏见的方法。

Method: 对GPT、LLaMA和Qwen系列的13个开放权重模型应用了Linear、Karcher Mean、SLERP、NuSLERP、TIES、DELLA和Nearswap七种算法，并使用三个偏见数据集（BBQ、BOLD和HONEST）进行了综合评估。同时测量了这些技术对SuperGLUE基准下游任务中LLM性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，偏见减少与下游性能之间存在权衡：减少偏见的方法会降低准确性，特别是在需要阅读理解、常识和因果推理的任务中。Linear、SLERP和Nearswap在保持整体性能的同时，持续减少偏见，其中适度插值权重的SLERP是最平衡的选择。

Conclusion: 模型合并算法在减少偏见方面具有潜力，但过度去偏见或不适当的合并方法可能导致重要语言能力的下降。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

TL;DR: CREST is a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications, but existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages.

Method: The model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages.

Result: CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above) across six safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了大型语言模型在处理不确定性方面涌现出的原则性，并强调了准确率和贝叶斯倾向之间的相关性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为SurveyEval的综合基准，用于评估自动生成的调查报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM自动生成调查报告的质量是一个挑战。

Method: 通过三个维度评估自动生成的调查报告：总体质量、纲要连贯性和参考文献准确性。使用LLM-as-a-Judge框架，并加入人工参考以提高评估与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 通用长文本或论文写作系统生成的调查报告质量较低，而专业的调查报告生成系统能够提供更高质量的结果。

Conclusion: SurveyEval可作为一个可扩展的测试平台，用于理解和改进各种主题和评估标准的自动调查系统。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TriLex的三阶段检索增强框架，用于系统地扩展低资源语言的情感词典。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中仍然代表性不足，限制了词汇覆盖和多语言自然语言处理（NLP）系统的性能。

Method: 该方法包括基于语料库的提取、跨语言映射和检索增强生成（RAG）驱动的词汇细化。

Result: AfroXLMR模型表现优异，在isiXhosa语和isiZulu语上的F1分数超过80%，且具有很强的跨语言稳定性。AfriBERTa模型也取得了约64%的可靠F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，TriLex是一个可扩展且有效的框架，适用于多语言情感词典扩展和低资源南非语言的情感建模。

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部监督的对齐大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，通过模型表征提取内在的、无标注的质量信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM与人类偏好对齐方法依赖外部监督，面临人类标注稀缺和主观、奖励模型易受攻击、自评估方法敏感且有偏差等问题。

Method: 提出稳定秩（stable rank）的概念，通过计算隐藏状态的有效维度来衡量质量，并将其作为强化学习的奖励信号，提出了SR-GRPO方法。

Result: 稳定秩在RewardBench上达到84.04%的准确率，并通过Best-of-N抽样将任务准确率平均提高11.3个百分点。SR-GRPO在STEM上将Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct提高了10%，在数学推理上提高了19%，优于学习的奖励模型和自评估基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可以从内部模型几何结构中提取质量信号，为无需外部监督的可扩展对齐提供了一条途径。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估中医的“辨证论治”，尤其是在治疗决策方面。

Method: 构建了一个由中医专家主导的、基于临床案例的基准测试，并采用专门的奖励模型来量化处方-证候的一致性。数据标注遵循严格的流程。该基准测试包含四个任务：中医基础知识、医学伦理、LLM内容安全和辨证论治。评估框架整合了三种机制：选择反应评估、判断模型评估和奖励模型评估。

Result: 通过对15个主流LLM（包括通用和中医领域）的实验，证实了TCM-BEST4SDT的有效性。

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT现已公开，旨在促进智能中医研究的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

To address this, we introduce promptolution, a unified and modular open-source framework that provides all components required for prompt optimization within a single extensible system for both practitioners and researchers. It integrates multiple contemporary discrete prompt optimizers while remaining agnostic to the underlying LLM implementation.

Conclusion: 系统提示优化是实现准确和鲁棒的多语言LLM行为的可扩展途径。

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究针对低资源语言孟加拉语的仇恨言论识别问题，探讨了多种机器学习和Transformer模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语是一种使用人数众多的低资源语言，缺乏足够的计算资源用于仇恨言论检测，因此有必要进行自动化moderation的研究。

Method: 研究使用了包括支持向量机、Logistic Regression、Random Forest、Decision Tree等机器学习方法，以及DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa等Transformer模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，除DistilBERT外，所有Transformer模型均优于传统机器学习方法，其中BanglaBERT表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了预训练语言模型在低资源孟加拉语仇恨言论识别中的潜力和必要性。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages remains a difficult problem due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

Conclusion: 由此产生的人工参与工作流程创建了一个结构化的反馈循环，可以提高模型的可靠性并持续提高响应质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数投票在开放式推理中效果不佳，因为完整解决方案的“多数”难以定义。

Method: 运行K个并行推理轨迹，并在同步点平均它们的下一个token logits，以产生单个连贯的输出。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA上与多数投票相匹配或超过，在开放式编码任务上取得了持续的收益。在LiveCodeBench（hard）上，DeepCoder-14B-Preview的pass@1提高了+8.28%，Qwen3-8B提高了+7.58%。

Conclusion: 并行测试时扩展可以使开放式推理受益，而无需依赖于对完整输出进行投票。

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

TL;DR: SchED是一种无需训练、模型无关的提前退出算法，通过聚合完整跨度的logits边际并满足进度相关的置信度阈值来加速扩散大语言模型(dLLM)的解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLM)是自回归模型的一个有希望的替代方案，但其应用因迭代采样缓慢而受到严重阻碍。

Method: 提出了一种名为SchED的提前退出算法，该算法聚合完整跨度的logits边际，并在达到平滑的、与进度相关的置信度阈值时停止解码。

Result: 在指令调整模型上，SchED实现了3.8-4.0倍的加速，同时平均保留了99.8-100%的基线分数。在基础模型上，SchED产生了一致的加速增益，具有99.1-100%的性能保留，在更积极的设置下高达2.34倍。保守的速度指标显示，SchED是稳健的，并且明显优于先前的基于置信度的提前退出方法。

Conclusion: SchED通过将真正的置信度稳定转化为计算节省，使dLLM解码效率大大提高。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型（VLM）在NPU上表现不佳，因为Vision Transformers（ViT）的量化脆弱性以及自回归注意力机制的I/O限制。

Method: 提出AutoNeural，一种NPU原生的VLM架构，采用MobileNetV5风格的backbone和结合了State-Space Model（SSM）原则的Transformer层，以实现高效的整数推理。

Result: AutoNeural显著提高了效率，视觉编码器的量化误差降低了7倍，端到端延迟降低了14倍，解码速度提高了3倍，上下文窗口比基线长4倍。

Conclusion: 针对NPU约束重新设计模型拓扑是实现稳健的多模态边缘智能的先决条件。

Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

Result: 实验表明，在不同语法设置下训练的微调模型可以纠正原始模型产生的同类型幻觉，从而提供可靠的CNF生成。

Conclusion: 微调模型能够有效减少逻辑翻译任务中的幻觉，并生成可靠的CNF。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

*Saeid Jamshidi,Kawser Wazed Nafi,Arghavan Moradi Dakhel,Negar Shahabi,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为 Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP) 的框架，用于评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 的道德稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐框架依赖于静态数据集和事后评估，无法深入了解伦理推理在不同语境或时间尺度上的演变。

Method: MoCoP 是一种无需数据集的闭环框架，它结合了词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计和基于推理的判断建模，以自主生成、评估和完善伦理场景。

Result: 对 GPT-4-Turbo 和 DeepSeek 的实验结果表明，MoCoP 有效地捕捉了纵向伦理行为，揭示了伦理维度和毒性维度之间存在很强的负相关关系 (rET = -0.81, p < 0.001)，并且与响应延迟几乎无关 (rEL ≈ 0)。

Conclusion: 道德连贯性和语言安全性是模型行为的稳定且可解释的特征，MoCoP 为可扩展的持续审计提供了可复制的基础，并推进了自主 AI 系统中计算道德的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了利用 Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM) TerraMind 进行洪水范围测绘，通过 FloodsNet 数据集进行微调，并与 U-Net 模型进行比较，评估了 GFM 在全球洪水事件中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前洪水灾害频发，地球观测卫星为洪水监测提供重要数据，但 оперативная 准确性依赖于带标签的数据集和模型泛化能力。GFM 通过大规模自监督预训练提高了泛化能力，但其在全球洪水事件中的性能尚不清楚。

Method: 使用 FloodsNet 数据集对 TerraMind 进行微调，测试了四种配置（基础模型与大型模型；冻结与解冻骨干网络），并与 TerraMind Sen1Floods11 示例和 U-Net 进行了比较。

Result: 基础-解冻配置在准确率、精确率和召回率之间取得了最佳平衡，且计算成本低于大型模型。FloodsNet 训练的模型在召回率方面优于 Sen1Floods11 训练的示例。U-Net 的召回率高于所有 GFM 配置，但准确率和精确率略低。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，集成多模态光学和 SAR 数据并微调 GFM 可以提高近实时洪水测绘能力，并突出了 GFM 在气候适应和灾害恢复方面的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

*Woongyeong Yeo,Kangsan Kim,Jaehong Yoon,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldMM：一种新型多模态记忆代理，用于理解长视频，它结合了文本和视觉信息，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型难以处理长视频，因为上下文容量有限，且在抽象过程中丢失了关键视觉细节。现有方法依赖文本摘要，未能充分利用视觉证据，且固定时间尺度限制了捕捉不同时长事件的灵活性。

Method: 提出WorldMM，它构建并检索多个互补记忆，包括情景记忆（索引事实事件）、语义记忆（更新概念知识）和视觉记忆（保存场景细节）。自适应检索代理迭代选择最相关的记忆源，并利用多个时间粒度。

Result: WorldMM在五个长视频问答基准测试中显著优于现有基线，平均性能提升8.4%。

Conclusion: WorldMM在长视频推理方面非常有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对比损失函数，通过结合两个收敛目标来提高学习效率并解决信息失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习中的对比损失函数在区分样本相似性方面起着关键作用，但这种学习机制也会引入来自增强样本的信息失真。模型可能过度依赖相同标签的样本信息，而忽略来自同一初始图像的正样本对，尤其是在大型数据集中。

Method: 提出了一种上下文丰富的对比损失函数，包含两个收敛目标。第一个目标区分相同和不同类别的特征，提高对比训练效率；第二个目标拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本，并推远所有其他样本。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100、Caltech-101、Caltech-256、ImageNet、BiasedMNIST、UTKFace和CelebA等8个图像分类任务的大规模基准数据集上进行了评估。实验结果表明，该方法在泛化性能和学习收敛速度方面均优于16种最先进的对比学习方法。在解决系统性失真任务方面表现突出，在下游BiasedMNIST数据集中，与原始对比损失函数相比，提高了22.9%。

Conclusion: 该技术在解决系统性失真任务中表现出色，并且更高效和公平的下游训练具有潜力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个分层评估框架，用于评估文本到图像 (T2I) 模型生成图像时对用户提示的遵守能力，并揭示了现有评估指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 T2I 模型在生成图像时，通常无法准确捕捉用户提示中的特定属性，例如指定颜色的正确对象数量。视觉语言模型 (VLM) 的基准测试也没有跟上 VLM 注释的场景复杂性。

Method: 该研究提出了一种结构化的方法，通过测试 VLM 是否可以识别 T2I 模型在具有挑战性的提示下生成的图像中的 27 种特定失败模式，从而联合评估 T2I 模型和 VLM。同时，构建了一个包含提示和图像的数据集，这些图像由 5 个 T2I 模型生成，并由 VLM 注释，以测试 VLM 是否能正确识别生成图像中的失败模式。

Result: 通过分析一组精心策划的提示上的失败模式，揭示了属性保真度和对象表示方面的系统性错误。研究结果表明，当前的指标不足以捕捉这些细微的错误。

Conclusion: 强调了有针对性的基准测试对于提高生成模型可靠性和可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合架构，该架构统一了视觉语言模型和基于 OCR 的系统，以实现精确的上下文检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型 (VLM) 能够实现最先进的文档检索，但它们返回的是整个页面，而不是特定区域，从而限制了检索增强生成 (RAG) 的效用。而基于 OCR 的系统缺乏用于相关性评估的语义基础。

Method: 该方法使用 ColPali 的补丁级相似性分数作为 OCR 提取区域的空间相关性过滤器，并形式化了视觉变换器补丁网格和 OCR 边界框之间的坐标映射，引入了用于相关性传播的交叉度量，并建立了检索精度的理论界限。该方法在推理时运行，无需额外训练。

Result: 发布了一个名为 Snappy 的开源实现，证明了该方法的实际适用性，并正在进行实证评估。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的混合架构，能够结合视觉语言模型和 OCR 系统的优点，实现更精确的文档检索，从而提高检索增强生成 (RAG) 的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于医学图像预测患者体细胞突变谱的深度潜变量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗的有效性通常依赖于早期诊断和治疗。

Method: 构建了一个名为 LLOST 的模型，该模型具有由单独的共享潜在空间耦合在一起的双变分自动编码器，该空间统一了来自病灶点云和不同体细胞突变计数的特征。该模型由三个潜在空间组成，每个潜在空间都通过条件归一化流先验学习，以解释每个域的不同分布。

Result: 在来自癌症影像档案的已识别医学图像和来自癌症基因组档案的泛癌症数据集的相应体细胞突变上进行了定性和定量实验。结果表明，该模型在特定突变计数方面的预测性能以及准确预测突变发生的能力。

Conclusion: 该模型能够预测特定突变的计数和突变的发生，并揭示了图像和体细胞突变域之间反映癌症类型的共享模式。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

TL;DR: SplatSuRe selectively applies super-resolution (SR) to undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision in 3D Gaussian Splatting, yielding sharper and more consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating higher-resolution renders in 3D Gaussian Splatting leads to multi-view inconsistencies when applying super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views independently.

Method: SplatSuRe selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, using camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content.

Result: SplatSuRe surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, with significant gains in localized foreground regions.

Conclusion: The paper proposes SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content in undersampled regions, achieving sharper and more consistent results by leveraging camera pose and scene geometry.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 RobustSurg 模型，以提高手术场景分割在不同中心和成像模式下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术场景分割方法难以泛化到未见过的分布和模态，且现有方法无法直接应用于手术场景。

Method: 利用风格和内容信息，通过实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术实现鲁棒和泛化的特征表示，并引入恢复模块以保留重要的任务相关特征。

Result: 在 HeiCholSeg 数据集上，RobustSurg 相比 baseline DeepLabv3+ 提高了近 23%，相比 SOTA 方法提高了 10-32%。在 EndoUDA polyp 数据集上，相比 baseline 提高了近 22%，相比 SOTA 方法提高了近 11%。

Conclusion: RobustSurg 模型在手术场景分割任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了单分形和多分形重新校准两种归纳先验，以提高深度学习中多分形分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端多分形方法依赖于重池化或强特征空间抽取，限制了语义分割等任务。

Method: 利用指数概率质量与多分形谱之间的关系，形成编码器嵌入的统计描述，并在卷积网络中实现为通道注意函数。

Result: 在基于U-Net的框架中，多分形重新校准比配备其他也使用高阶统计量的通道注意机制的基线产生 существенное 收益。在三个公共医学图像数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 激发响应不会随着U-Net架构中编码器深度的增加而变得越来越专业，并且它们的有效性可能与实例变异性的全局统计有关。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [54] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Unified-VQA 的通用视频质量评估框架，该框架通过将 VQA 视为诊断混合专家 (MoE) 问题，从而适用于多种视频格式中的各种失真类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频质量评估 (VQA) 方法通常采用单片模型，这些模型通常为每个测试视频预测一个质量分数，无法提供诊断性的、可解释的反馈，并且是专门的、格式特定的指标，而不是真正的“通用”解决方案。

Method: Unified-VQA 采用多个“感知专家”，致力于不同的感知领域。一种新的多代理专家训练策略被设计来优化每个专家，使用受排名启发的损失，由其领域最合适的代理指标指导。我们还将一个诊断多任务头集成到该框架中，以生成全局质量分数和一个可解释的多维伪像向量，该向量使用弱监督学习策略进行优化，利用为此工作生成的大规模训练数据库的已知属性。

Result: Unified-VQA 在包含高清、超高清、HDR 和 HFR 格式的各种流媒体伪像的 17 个数据库中，在通用 VQA 和诊断伪像检测任务方面，与超过 18 种基准方法相比，展示出一致且卓越的性能（使用静态模型参数，无需重新训练或微调）。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了朝着实用、可操作和可解释的视频质量评估迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了AV-SpeakerBench，一个用于评估MLLM在真实视频中以说话者为中心的视听推理能力的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频基准很少评估关于人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务在视觉上是可解的或仅粗略地评估语音，无法深入了解模型是否可以对齐谁在说话、说了什么以及何时发生。

Method: 创建了一个包含3,212个多项选择题的AV-SpeakerBench基准，该基准以说话者为中心，问题设计中嵌入了视听依赖关系，并由专家策划了注释，以确保时间精度和跨模态有效性。

Result: Gemini系列模型表现优于开源系统，Gemini 2.5 Pro取得了最佳结果。在开源模型中，Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但仍然落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，这主要是由于较弱的视听融合而不是视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为推进未来多模态系统中细粒度的视听推理奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为时空金字塔流（SPF）的新型流匹配方法，用于模拟地球气候变化，该方法在多个时间尺度上高效、并行地进行气候模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的生成方法依赖于天气尺度的自回归进行气候模拟，但对于长时间的气候范围来说，这 inherently 很慢，并且尚未证明在非平稳强迫下的稳定展开。

Method: SPF 将生成轨迹划分为一个时空金字塔，逐步提高空间分辨率以减少计算，并将每个阶段与相关的时间尺度耦合，以实现金字塔中任何时间级别的直接采样。此外，每个阶段都以规定的物理强迫（例如，温室气体或气溶胶）为条件。

Result: 在 ClimateBench 上，SPF 在年度和月度时间尺度上优于强大的流匹配基线和预训练模型，同时提供快速采样，尤其是在较粗的时间级别上。此外，SPF 模型在气候模型的预留情景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF 和 ClimateSuite 为跨时间尺度和实际未来情景的准确、高效、概率气候模拟奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用文本到视频模型CogVideo进行图像修复的方法，通过微调使其生成修复轨迹而非自然视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本到视频模型在图像修复中的潜力。

Method: 通过构建合成数据集，微调CogVideo模型，使其学习将时间进展与修复质量相关联。采用了两种prompt策略：统一文本prompt和场景特定prompt。

Result: 实验表明，CogVideo能有效恢复空间细节和光照一致性，同时保持时间连贯性。在ReLoBlur数据集上表现出强大的零样本鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CogVideo模型能够有效地进行图像修复，并在真实场景中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MORP--Synth的两阶段合成增强框架，以提高模型在地中海和秘鲁之间的迁移能力，解决SAR油膜分割模型泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在SAR油膜分割上泛化性差，尤其是在缺乏标注数据的秘鲁沿海地区。由于不同地区的海况、后向散射统计和油膜形态存在差异，导致模型难以泛化。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：1) 形态区域扰动（Morphological Region Perturbation），通过曲率引导的标签空间方法生成真实的油膜和类油膜区域的几何变化；2) 使用条件生成INADE模型从编辑后的掩模渲染SAR样式的纹理。

Result: 在秘鲁数据集上，使用地中海数据预训练的模型性能从67.8% mIoU下降到51.8%；MORP--Synth将性能提高了高达+6 mIoU，并提高了少数类的IoU（油膜+10.8，类油膜+14.6）。

Conclusion: MORP--Synth框架能够有效提高SAR油膜分割模型在不同区域之间的迁移能力，尤其是在缺乏标注数据的区域。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Motivation: 现有的自监督跟踪器在视觉线索变得模糊时表现不佳，限制了它们的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 该方法利用视频扩散模型在早期高噪声阶段隔离运动的特性，提取运动表征用于跟踪。

Result: 该方法在区分视觉上相似的物体方面显著提高了性能，并在基准测试和新测试中取得了高达 6 个点的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法利用扩散导出的运动表征，实现了对具有挑战性视点变化和形变的相同物体的鲁棒跟踪。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Motivation: 现有的方法在保持时间一致性方面存在局限性，例如假设有效性、局部对齐范围和噪声几何下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架具有鲁棒性和通用性，可与不同的3D基础模型和相机配置兼容。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MS-CAM的可视化解释方法，以提高CNN在SAR图像处理中的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在SAR任务中取得了显著成功，但其复杂性和不透明性限制了它们在高可靠性要求下的应用。提高CNN的可解释性对于其在SAR中的发展和部署至关重要。

Method: MS-CAM将SAR图像与CNN提取的特征图和梯度进行匹配，并结合通道和元素权重，以可视化模型在SAR图像中学习的决策基础。

Result: 在自建的SAR目标分类数据集上进行的大量实验表明，MS-CAM能够更准确地突出网络感兴趣的区域，并捕获详细的目标特征信息，从而增强网络的可解释性。此外，验证了MS-CAM在弱监督目标定位中的可行性。

Conclusion: 分析了影响定位精度的关键因素，如像素阈值，为未来的工作提供参考。

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

TL;DR: 统一多模态模型在理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但同时也带来了推理效率低下的问题。该研究通过训练自由剪枝方法对统一多模态模型组件进行了系统分析，发现理解组件具有显著的可压缩性，而生成组件对压缩高度敏感。为了解决这个问题，该研究提出了一种混合专家（MoE）自适应方法，通过稀疏激活来恢复生成质量。实验结果表明，该方法能够在激活大约一半参数的情况下，达到与完整模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一的多模态模型集成了异构组件，以支持单一框架内的理解和生成能力，但这种统一性引入了推理效率低下的问题，因为特定任务或样本可能不需要统一模型的全部知识或能力。然而，对于这些低效率如何在不同组件中表现出来的系统性理解仍然有限。

Method: 该研究首先使用训练自由剪枝作为探测方法，对统一多模态模型组件进行了系统分析，包括深度剪枝和宽度缩减。然后，为了解决生成组件对压缩的敏感性问题，该研究提出了一种混合专家（MoE）自适应方法，该方法将生成模块划分为多个专家，并启用稀疏激活以恢复生成质量。

Result: 研究表明，理解组件在理解和生成任务中都表现出显著的可压缩性，尤其是在后者中更为明显。相比之下，生成组件对压缩高度敏感，即使在适度的压缩率下，性能也会急剧下降。通过专家冻结调整验证了稀疏激活的有效性，并进一步证明了完全可训练的自适应可以带来额外的收益。经过调整的BAGEL模型在仅激活大约一半参数的情况下，实现了与完整模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了统一多模态模型中理解和生成组件的不同特性，并提出了一种混合专家自适应方法，通过稀疏激活来提高推理效率，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习多视角人群计数方法需要大量且昂贵的人群注释和相机校准。现有的免校准方法仍然需要昂贵的图像级人群注释来训练单视角计数模块。

Method: 提出了一种弱监督的免校准多视角人群计数方法 (WSCF-MVCC)，直接使用人群计数作为单视角计数模块的监督，而不是密度图。利用利用多尺度先验的自监督排序损失来增强模型的感知能力，而无需额外的注释成本。利用语义信息来实现更准确的视图匹配，从而实现更精确的场景级人群计数估计。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的多视角计数数据集上，该方法在弱监督设置下优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法比校准方法更适合实际部署。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Conclusion: VACoT框架能够显著提高视觉语言模型在各种感知任务中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，尤其是在对抗性环境中，且具有较低的训练复杂性和计算开销。

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

Motivation: 传统微调或适配方法受到隐私和安全约束的限制，需要输入级别的策略来增强泛化能力，而无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: SAGE有效地弥合了冻结模型不变性与未见领域多样性之间的差距。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

*Yuqing Shao,Yuchen Yang,Rui Yu,Weilong Li,Xu Guo,Huaicheng Yan,Wei Wang,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FDTA的特征细化框架，以提高端到端多目标跟踪（MOT）方法中的对象区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端MOT方法由于过度强调单帧内的类别级区分，导致对象嵌入的 inter-object 相似度过高，从而降低了关联精度。

Method: FDTA 包含三个互补的视角：空间适配器（SA）、时间适配器（TA）和身份适配器（IA），分别用于整合深度感知线索、聚合历史信息和利用质量感知对比学习。

Result: FDTA 在多个具有挑战性的 MOT 基准测试中取得了 state-of-the-art 的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了所提出的区分性嵌入增强策略的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的雷达语义分割方法，通过相机引导的雷达标记流水线生成精确的雷达点云标签，无需人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的雷达语义分割研究受到开源数据集和标签稀缺的限制。现有的RaDelft数据集只提供LiDAR注释，没有公开代码来生成雷达标签，限制了可重复性和下游研究。

Method: 该方法通过将雷达点云投影到基于相机的语义分割中，并应用空间聚类来创建标签，从而提高雷达标签的准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法可以生成精确的雷达点云标签，并建立了一个可重复的框架，允许研究人员训练和评估标记的4D雷达数据。

Conclusion: 本文的研究建立了一个可重复的框架，可以训练和评估标记的4D雷达数据，并研究了不同雾度水平如何影响雷达标记性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将图像处理和网络搜索视为分离的能力，并且依赖于昂贵的强化学习，缺乏基于真实工具执行轨迹的规划。

Method: 使用监督微调在少于30,000个高质量的、规划-执行一致的轨迹上进行训练，并通过逐步一致性过滤进行验证。

Result: 在MMSearch上获得66.1分，在FVQA上获得67.2分，超过了Gemini 2.5 Flash在所有11个指标上的表现。

Conclusion: 复杂Agent多模态智能可以通过精心策划的监督学习来实现，而无需依赖强化学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在定位未见过的物体时，决策过程不透明，成功率低。

Method: 提出Nav-R^2框架，通过链式思考(CoT)和相似性感知记忆来建模目标-环境关系和环境-行动规划。构建NavR^2-CoT数据集，教导模型感知环境，关注目标相关物体，并制定行动计划。使用相似性感知记忆(SA-Mem)从时间和语义角度保留目标相关和当前观察相关的特征。

Conclusion: Nav-R^2通过简化的流程有效地定位了未见过的物体。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多模态问题上的辩论效果，现有研究主要集中在纯语言任务上。

Method: 提出了加权迭代专家社会（WISE）框架，将智能体分为生成解决方案的解决者和验证正确性并提供反馈的反射者，并使用改进的Dawid-Skene算法进行后处理。

Result: 在SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA和SMART-840++数据集上，WISE的准确率比现有MAD方法提高了2-7%。

Conclusion: WISE框架在各种多模态任务和LLM配置中始终提高了准确性。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以检测薄结构组件，并且生成的mask边界不规则，缺乏后续矢量化所需的几何精度。

Method: 一种混合神经网络架构，利用分层 Mix-Transformer 编码器来捕获全局上下文，以及一个增强了 scSE 注意力块的 U-Net 解码器来实现精确的边界恢复。此外，还提出了一种基于 Tversky 损失函数的优化策略，以有效平衡精度和召回率。

Conclusion: MitUNet 为自动 3D 重建管道中的数据准备提供了一个强大的工具。

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为GuiDG的框架，用于解决视觉-语言模型（VLM）微调中的领域泛化问题。该框架通过训练多个参数高效的领域专家模型，并利用跨模态注意力模块指导视觉编码器的微调，从而在领域特异性和领域泛化能力之间取得平衡。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的VLM微调方法在领域特异性和领域泛化能力之间存在trade-off，直接在整个数据集上微调通用模型可能会损害其泛化到未见领域的能力。

Method: 该论文首先从理论上分析了VLM微调的泛化能力，然后提出了一个两步走的领域专家引导的DG（GuiDG）框架。GuiDG首先使用prompt tuning获得源领域专家，然后引入跨模态注意力模块，通过自适应专家集成来指导视觉编码器的微调。

Result: 在标准DG基准和ImageNet-DG上的大量实验表明，GuiDG优于最先进的微调方法，同时保持了效率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的GuiDG框架能够有效地提高VLM在领域泛化方面的性能，同时保持效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在GUI导航中具有优势，并为构建更强大和通用的GUI智能体提供了实践指导。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Conclusion: LightHCG模型在青光眼检测方面具有更高的性能和效率，并为AI驱动的干预分析提供了可能性。

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Motivation: 在医疗健康领域，获取详细的标注数据非常困难，因此需要强大的视觉-语言模型。对比学习是训练视觉-语言模型的关键范式，但需要大的批次大小，计算需求高，并且通常仅限于资源充足的机构。此外，由于医疗保健数据有限，重要的是在训练期间优先考虑从数据和模型中提取知识，以提高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法旨在通过减少资源需求同时提高优于 SOTA 方法的性能来推进高效的多模态学习。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据和计算预算有限的情况下，将大型预训练模型适应于未见过的任务仍然具有挑战性。虽然元学习方法可以显式地学习良好的初始化，但它们需要额外的元训练阶段，产生高训练成本，并且可能不稳定。同时，特定于任务的预训练模型的数量持续增长，但是如何以最少的额外训练将它们转移到新任务的问题仍然相对未被探索。

Method: BOLT框架离线阶段从多个任务向量中收集主奇异方向，并逐层正交化它们，以形成可重用的基。在线阶段，我们冻结这些基，并且仅为新任务训练每层的一小组对角线系数，从而产生具有极少可训练参数的秩控制更新。

Result: 结果表明，与常见的PEFT基线以及代表性的元学习初始化相比，将适应限制在任务相关的正交子空间内，为未见过的任务转移提供了一种有效的替代方案，实现了稳健的性能。

Conclusion: BOLT框架通过重用现有微调模型，提取正交谱基并在子空间内调整，为未见过的任务转移提供了一种有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为时间动态增强器 (TDE) 的新方法，以增强 Spiking 神经⽹络 (SNN) 的时间信息建模能力，并降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 SNN 通常直接复制输⼊或以固定间隔将其聚合到帧中，导致神经元在时间步⻓上接收到⼏乎相同的刺激，严重限制了模型的表达能⼒，尤其是在对象检测等复杂任务中。

Method: 该⽂提出了时间动态增强器 (TDE)，它由两个模块组成：⼀个⽣成跨时间步⻓的各种输⼊刺激的 Spiking 编码器 (SE) 和⼀个基于时间依赖性指导 SE ⽣成的注意⼒门控模块 (AGM)。此外，为了消除 AGM 引⼊的⾼能乘法运算，该⽂提出了⼀种 Spike 驱动的注意⼒ (SDA) 来降低注意⼒相关的能耗。

Result: ⼤量实验表明，TDE 可以⽆缝集成到现有的基于 SNN 的检测器中，并且始终优于最先进的⽅法，在静态 PASCAL VOC 数据集上实现了 57.7% 的 mAP50-95 分数，在神经形态 EvDET200K 数据集上实现了 47.6% 的 mAP50-95 分数。在能源消耗⽅⾯，SDA 仅消耗传统注意⼒模块 0.240 倍的能源。

Conclusion: TDE 能有效提升 SNN 在对象检测任务中的性能，并在降低能耗⽅⾯表现出⾊。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

TL;DR: 现有的3D布局估计模型主要在包含简单单间或单层环境的合成数据集上进行训练。因此，它们无法处理大型多层建筑物，需要将场景分割成单独的楼层才能进行处理，这会移除对于诸如连接多个楼层的楼梯等结构进行推理至关重要的全局空间上下文。在这项工作中，我们引入了HouseLayout3D，这是一个真实世界的基准，旨在支持在完整建筑物规模的布局估计方面取得进展，包括多层和建筑上复杂的空间。我们还提出了MultiFloor3D，这是一个简单的免训练基线，它利用了最新的场景理解方法，并且已经优于我们基准和先前数据集上的现有3D布局估计模型，突出了在该方向上进行进一步研究的必要性。

Motivation: 现有的3D布局估计模型无法处理大型多层建筑物，需要将场景分割成单独的楼层才能进行处理，这会移除全局空间上下文。

Conclusion: 提出了HouseLayout3D，这是一个真实世界的基准，旨在支持在完整建筑物规模的布局估计方面取得进展，包括多层和建筑上复杂的空间。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为ClusterStyle的框架，旨在解决现有模型在捕捉风格内部多样性方面的挑战。该框架利用一组原型来建模同一风格类别中不同的风格模式，并结合全局和局部两种风格多样性，通过与非学习原型锚对齐来优化结构化的风格嵌入空间。此外，该模型还使用了风格调制适配器（SMA）来整合风格特征，并在风格化运动生成和运动风格迁移方面优于现有模型。

Method: 该论文提出了一个基于聚类的框架ClusterStyle，利用一组原型来建模同一风格类别中不同的风格模式。该框架考虑了全局和局部两种风格多样性，并通过与非学习原型锚对齐来优化结构化的风格嵌入空间。此外，该模型还使用了风格调制适配器（SMA）来整合风格特征。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的框架，可以有效地建模风格内部的多样性，并在风格化运动生成和运动风格迁移方面取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 See-Think-Learn (STL) 的自训练框架，以提升视觉语言模型 (VLM) 的多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提升推理能力的方法依赖于高质量的思维链 (CoT) 数据，而这些数据通常需要大量人工标注或昂贵的专有模型，或忽略感知的自训练方法。

Method: 引入了一种结构化的推理模板，鼓励模型在思考之前先“看”，首先以文本形式提取视觉属性，然后使用它们来指导推理。该框架通过让模型在自训练循环中生成和学习自己的结构化理由来共同改进感知和推理。此外，我们使用负面理由（即解释为什么某些答案选项不正确）来扩充训练数据，以增强模型区分正确和误导性响应的能力。

Result: 在不同领域的实验表明，STL 始终优于仅在答案或自生成的推理上直接训练的基线，而定性分析证实了其理由的高质量。

Conclusion: STL 为增强 VLM 的多模态推理能力提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了音视频联合去噪训练是否能提升视频生成质量，即使只关注视频质量。通过实验，作者发现音视频联合去噪在包含大幅运动和物体接触运动的视频生成中表现更优，并推测这是因为预测音频有助于模型理解视觉事件和声音之间的因果关系，从而规范视频动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音视频生成系统表明，耦合模态不仅有益于音视频同步，还能提升视频模态本身。因此，本文研究音视频联合去噪训练对视频生成的影响。

Method: 作者提出了一个参数高效的音视频Full DiT (AVFullDiT) 架构，该架构利用预训练的文本到视频 (T2V) 和文本到音频 (T2A) 模块进行联合去噪。训练了一个T2AV模型和一个T2V模型，并在相同的设置下进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，音视频联合去噪可以带来超越同步性的提升，在包含大幅运动和物体接触运动的具有挑战性的子集中观察到了一致的改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，跨模态协同训练是开发更强大、更符合物理规律的世界模型的一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有研究通常关注单个具身任务，而忽略了现实生活中常见的连续任务，在连续任务中，智能体需要重用先前探索中积累的空间知识来支持后续的推理和探索。

Method: 提出了3DSPMR，一种3D空间记忆推理方法，利用来自已探索区域的关系、视觉和几何线索来增强多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），以进行连续具身任务中的推理和探索。

Result: 3DSPMR在连续EQA和EMN任务上都取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该论文是第一个将几何信息显式地结合到基于MLLM的空间理解和推理中的工作，并在连续具身任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据集蒸馏方法，称为轨迹引导数据集蒸馏 (TGDD)，该方法通过在模型的训练轨迹上对齐合成数据和原始数据之间的特征分布来解决现有 distribution matching (DM) 方法忽略训练期间特征表示演变的问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 distribution matching (DM) 的数据集蒸馏方法忽略了训练期间特征表示的演变，限制了合成数据的表达能力并削弱了下游性能。

Method: 将 distribution matching 重新定义为沿模型训练轨迹的动态对齐过程，在每个训练阶段通过对齐合成数据和原始数据集之间的特征分布来捕获不断发展的语义，并引入分布约束正则化以减少类重叠。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD 实现了最先进的性能，尤其是在高分辨率基准测试中实现了 5.0% 的准确率提升。

Conclusion: TGDD 在性能和效率之间取得了良好的平衡，无需额外的优化开销，并且可以帮助合成数据保留语义多样性和代表性，从而提高下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with long-term temporal and spatial consistency due to high computational costs.

Method: Trajectory packing and memory retrieval are used for efficient compressed memory.

Result: WorldPack outperforms state-of-the-art models on the LoopNav Minecraft benchmark.

Conclusion: WorldPack significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在医疗诊断中存在推理脱节问题，并且多智能体框架存在文本噪声和计算成本高的问题，同时未能将推理锚定到视觉证据上。

Method: UCAgents通过限制智能体交互和引入单轮询问讨论来约束视觉模糊性和文本噪声，从而实现单向收敛。

Result: 在四个医疗VQA基准测试中，UCAgents取得了更高的准确率（在PathVQA上达到71.3%，比现有技术水平高出6.0%），同时降低了87.7%的token成本。

Conclusion: UCAgents在诊断可靠性和计算效率之间取得了平衡，使其更适合实际临床部署。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 强调了解码器设计在3D多模态推理中的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Result: ARPS层显著提高了DeepGMR及其变体UGMMReg的性能。扩展模型甚至优于使用注意力块和Transformer提取重叠区域或共同参考点的先前深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为使用深度学习和GMM的配准方法提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

Conclusion: ReVSeg通过显式分解视角和在VLM中执行顺序决策，实现了最先进的视频对象分割性能和可解释的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的单视觉语言模型dots.ocr，用于文档布局解析，该模型联合学习三个核心任务，并在多语言环境中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档布局解析方法依赖于多阶段pipeline，存在误差传播问题，且未能充分利用联合训练的协同效应。

Method: 构建了一个高度可扩展的数据引擎，合成了大量的多语言语料库，从而支持模型在各种任务中实现稳健的性能。

Result: 在OmniDocBench上取得了state-of-the-art的性能，并在新的基准测试XDocParse上超越了现有最佳模型7.4个百分点。

Conclusion: 证明了所提出的统一范式的有效性，并为全球文档智能研究建立了一个强大的新基线。

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

### [98] [The 4/$δ$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080)
*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个LLM-验证器收敛定理，为LLM辅助验证提供了首个具有可证明保证的形式化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用形式化验证工具与大型语言模型（LLM）的方法仍然不可靠，缺乏坚实的理论基础。

Method: 将LLM和验证器之间的交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，状态转移由误差减少概率（δ）决定。

Result: 理论证明程序对于任何δ> 0都几乎肯定会终止，预期迭代次数有界，且实验结果与理论高度一致。

Conclusion: 理论保证和实验证据为LLM辅助验证提供了更清晰的架构基础，工程师可以进行可预测的资源规划和性能预算。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图通常以静态图像共享，不易编辑和重用。

Method: 使用详细的系统提示和视觉语言模型将流程图图像转换为可编辑的Mermaid.js代码。该界面支持通过内联文本编辑、拖放节点插入和自然语言命令进行混合 инициаative 细化。

Result: 该方法生成了一种结构化的、可版本控制的文本表示，该表示与渲染的图表保持同步。引入评估指标来评估跨多个模型的结构精度、流程正确性、语法有效性和完整性。

Conclusion: Flowchart2Mermaid系统能够有效地将流程图图像转换为可编辑和重用的Mermaid.js代码，并提供多种交互方式进行优化。

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

*Alexander Boyd,Franz Nowak,David Hyland,Manuel Baltieri,Fernando E. Rosas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分解复杂世界模型（由 transducers 表示，transducers 是一类泛化 POMDPs 的模型）的框架，通过将世界模型分解为在不同输入输出子空间上运行的子 transducers，实现并行化和可解释性，从而提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景通常涉及以模块化方式交互的子组件，因此可以通过高效建模来利用这一事实。

Method: 开发了一个用于分解由 transducers 表示的复杂世界模型的框架。重点研究如何逆转 transducers 的组合过程，从而推导出在不同的输入输出子空间上运行的子 transducers。

Result: 结果表明，该方法能够推导出在不同的输入输出子空间上运行的子 transducers，从而实现并行化和可解释性，并支持分布式推理。

Conclusion: 这些结果为弥合 AI 安全所需的结构透明性和实际推理所需的计算效率奠定了基础。

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

*Shubhi Asthana,Bing Zhang,Chad DeLuca,Ruchi Mahindru,Hima Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了STRIDE框架，用于评估何时真正需要自主Agentic AI，避免过度使用导致成本和复杂性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从无状态LLM向自主Agent的快速转变引发了一个核心问题：何时Agentic AI是真正必要的？过度使用会导致成本、复杂性和风险增加。

Method: STRIDE框架通过整合结构化任务分解、动态性归因和自我反思需求分析，生成一个Agentic适用性评分，确保完全自主性仅保留给具有内在动态性或不断发展的上下文的任务。

Result: 在涵盖SRE、合规和企业自动化的30个真实世界任务中，STRIDE在模态选择方面达到了92%的准确率，减少了45%的不必要Agent部署，并降低了37%的资源成本。

Conclusion: 这项工作将Agent的应用重新定义为一种由必要性驱动的设计决策，确保只有在其收益证明成本合理时才应用自主性。

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代工作中数字协作工具使用中人为错误和延迟的问题。

Method: 扩展TheAgentCompany，构建金融环境，引入合成领域数据，丰富同事模拟，并设计自动任务生成流程。

Result: 构建了一个包含12个任务对的财富管理助手基准，涵盖检索、分析和综合/沟通，并具有明确的验收标准和确定性评分器。研究发现，代理的限制更多在于端到端工作流程的可靠性，而非数学推理，且自主性水平有显著影响。

Conclusion: 代理模型的错误评估阻碍了基准测试的有效性。

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

TL;DR: 论文提出TradeTrap，一个用于评估自主交易代理在对抗或故障条件下可靠性和鲁棒性的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于LLM的交易代理越来越多地部署在现实金融市场中执行自主分析和执行，但它们在高风险、不可逆转的金融环境中运行的可靠性和鲁棒性在对抗或故障条件下仍未得到充分检验。

Method: TradeTrap针对自主交易代理的四个核心组成部分：市场情报、策略制定、投资组合和账本处理以及交易执行，并在受控的系统级扰动下评估其鲁棒性。所有评估均在具有相同初始条件的真实美国股票市场数据的闭环历史回测环境中进行，从而可以在代理和攻击之间进行公平且可重复的比较。

Result: 实验表明，单个组件上的小扰动会传播通过代理决策循环，并导致极端集中、失控风险和大型投资组合回撤。

Conclusion: 表明当前的自主交易代理可以在系统层面上被系统地误导。

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanlewen/TradeTrap.

Method: 通过比较人工系统和生物认知，并整合来自人工智能研究、认知科学和神经科学的见解，确定了限制当代人工智能模型的七个核心缺陷。

Result: 确定了限制当代人工智能模型的七个核心缺陷：缺乏内在自我监控、缺乏元认知意识、固定和非自适应学习机制、无法重构目标、缺乏表征维护、缺乏具身反馈以及缺乏内在能动性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为DialogGuard的多智能体框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）生成的回复中存在的心理社会风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型语言模型在网络心理健康、危机干预和其他情感敏感服务中应用广泛，但它们在这些场景下的心理社会安全性却缺乏充分的理解和评估。

Method: 该框架通过四种LLM-as-a-judge的流程来评估风险，包括单智能体评分、双智能体纠正、多智能体辩论和随机多数投票，并基于一个共享的三级标准。

Result: 实验表明，多智能体机制比非LLM基线和单智能体判断能更准确地检测到心理社会风险；双智能体纠正和多数投票在准确性、与人类评级的一致性和鲁棒性之间提供了最佳的平衡。

Conclusion: DialogGuard作为一个开源软件发布，带有一个Web界面，可以提供每个维度的风险评分和可解释的自然语言理由，并通过一个包含12名从业者的形成性研究，展示了它如何支持针对脆弱用户的网络应用程序的prompt设计、审计和监督。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

Motivation: To enable safe, explainable decision making in MCAS by learning governing dynamical equations on edge devices, which is hindered by the inefficiency of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) on FPGAs due to their iterative nature, leading to high memory and energy consumption.

Method: A parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs is proposed to replace iterative solvers.

Result: Achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs.

Conclusion: MERINDA is suitable for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS due to the inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy.

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注释医学图像需要大量时间和专业知识，通常需要病理学家花费数百小时来标记乳腺上皮细胞核数据集。本文旨在解决这一关键挑战。

Method: 该框架使用基于量子的边缘增强、多组件损失函数、基于复杂性的加权抽样策略以及 EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ 架构。

Result: 该框架实现了 95.5% 的 Dice 分数和 91.2% 的 IoU，量子增强将边界精度提高了 2.1%，加权抽样将小病灶检测提高了 3.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法以有限的注释实现了突破性的性能，显著减少了数据集创建所需的医学专家时间，解决了临床感知 AI 发展中的一个根本瓶颈。

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrail research is limited to unimodal settings and binary classification, lacking robustness across diverse modalities and tasks.

Method: A large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples was curated to train OmniGuard. The samples cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation.

Conclusion: OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Motivation: 当前缺乏细粒度的基准，将多视角推理与单视角感知和时间因素隔离开来。

Method: 提出了一个认知驱动的基准测试ReMindView-Bench，用于评估VLM如何在互补的视角之间构建、对齐和维护空间心理模型。

Result: 对15个当前VLM的评估显示，在多视角空间推理中，跨视角对齐和视角转换方面存在持续的失败。

Conclusion: VLM在跨视图整合信息时性能会急剧下降，揭示了VLM空间推理中多视角空间心理模型的形成、退化和不稳定化的过程。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的生成式Agent的MMO模拟系统，以优化数值系统和机制设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖于大规模在线实验或在预定义的统计模型上进行参数调整，成本高、耗时，并且可能扰乱玩家体验。简化的离线模拟系统虽然常用作替代方案，但其有限的保真度阻止了Agent准确地模仿真实玩家的推理和对干预的反应。

Method: 通过在大型真实玩家行为数据上应用监督式微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），使LLM从通用先验适应于游戏特定领域，从而实现真实且可解释的玩家决策。同时，训练一个基于数据的环境模型，该模型基于真实游戏日志重建动态游戏内系统。

Result: 实验表明，该系统与真实玩家行为具有很强的一致性，并且在干预下具有合理的因果响应，为数据驱动的数值设计优化提供了一个可靠、可解释且经济高效的框架。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于LLM的生成式Agent的MMO模拟系统，能够以较低的成本和时间消耗，更真实地模拟玩家行为，从而优化数值系统和机制设计。

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

Conclusion: 在策略强化学习方法对于激发自我纠正能力非常有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Motivation: 预测市场允许用户交易真实世界事件的结果，但容易因重叠的问题、隐含的等价关系和市场之间的隐藏矛盾而分散。

Method: 使用自然语言理解对合约文本和元数据进行聚类，并识别集群内市场对之间已解决结果的强依赖关系。

Result: Agent识别的关系达到大约60-70%的准确率，并且它们引 induced 的交易策略在一周的时间范围内获得大约20%的平均回报。

Conclusion: Agentic AI和大型语言模型能够揭示预测市场中潜在的语义结构。

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

TL;DR: R-Few is a guided self-play framework for AI self-evolution that uses lightweight human oversight to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unguided self-evolving systems often fail due to concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution.

Method: R-Few incorporates human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training, using a Challenger-Solver framework with curriculum learning.

Result: R-Few achieves consistent improvements on math and reasoning benchmarks, with Qwen3-8B-Base improving by +3.0 points on math tasks compared to R-Zero.

Conclusion: R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics in AI self-evolution.

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为COPE的基于LLaMA-3-8B的链式思考(CoT)框架，用于预测急性缺血性卒中(AIS)患者90天后的功能预后，该框架从非结构化临床笔记中进行预测，性能与GPT-4.1相当，优于ClinicalBERT等模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的上下文信息，但其非结构化的性质限制了其在传统预测模型中的应用。因此，本文旨在开发一种能够从非结构化临床文本中准确预测AIS患者预后的方法。

Method: 本文构建了COPE框架，该框架使用两步CoT方法，基于LLaMA-3-8B模型，首先生成临床推理，然后输出mRS评分预测。同时，本文将COPE与GPT-4.1、ClinicalBERT、基于结构化变量的机器学习模型(Clinical ML)以及单步LLM进行了比较。

Result: COPE的MAE为1.01，+/-1准确率为74.4%，精确准确率为32.8%，与GPT-4.1相当，优于ClinicalBERT、Clinical ML和单步LLM。在不同性别和年龄的亚组分析中，COPE表现稳定。

Conclusion: COPE是一个轻量级、可解释且保护隐私的开源框架，为从非结构化临床文本中预测预后提供了一个准确且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Motivation: 现有的内容审核系统在识别隐性风险和提供可解释的判断过程方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用包含五个核心智能体的协作架构，通过动态的、相互说服的辩论机制对多模态内容进行深入分析和裁决，该机制基于 RAG 的知识检索。

Result: 在提出的基准测试 (AIR-Bench) 上的综合实验验证了 Aetheria 不仅生成详细且可追溯的审计报告，而且在整体内容安全准确性方面，特别是在识别隐性风险方面，优于基线。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了一个透明且可解释的范例，显著提升了可信赖的 AI 内容审核领域。

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种先进的多模态共情预测方法，该方法集成了视频、音频和文本信息，并在训练阶段利用监督文档作为特权信息，以提高文本特征的提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共情预测技术主要集中于单一模态（通常是文本），忽略了多模态处理能力，并且忽略了某些特权信息（可能包含额外的共情内容）的利用。

Method: 该方法包括多模态共情预测和监督文档辅助训练。使用预训练网络提取来自各种模态的特征，然后进行跨模态融合，产生多模态特征表示，用于预测共情标签。在辅助训练阶段，我们结合监督文档作为特权信息，以增强文本特征的提取。具体来说，我们应用潜在狄利克雷分配模型来识别潜在的主题分布，以约束文本特征。

Result: 在多模态和对话共情数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地利用了多模态信息和特权信息，提高了共情预测的准确性。

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Motivation: 现有的学术写作助手与编辑器分离，无法深入交互文档状态、结构和修订历史。这使得在LaTeX编辑器（如Overleaf）中直接支持主动的、上下文感知的操作成为不可能。

Method: PaperDebugger通过Chrome扩展、Kubernetes原生编排层和模型上下文协议(MCP)工具链来解决这些挑战，集成了文献搜索、参考文献查找、文档评分和修订流程。

Result: 演示展示了一个完全集成的workflow，包括本地化编辑、结构化审查、并行代理执行和基于差异的更新，封装在一个最小侵入的用户界面(UI)中。早期汇总分析表明用户积极参与，并验证了编辑器原生、主动写作助手的实用性。

Conclusion: PaperDebugger是一个实用的编辑器原生、主动写作助手

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

Motivation: Limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows.

Method: IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. It grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. Introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues.

Result: Presents qualitative evidence from real-world workflows in the kragent.ai system.

Conclusion: IACT mitigates error propagation and enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution.

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨域RUL预测的域适应方法TACDA，该方法通过目标域重建策略和聚类配对策略，在学习域不变特征的同时，保留目标特定信息和对齐相似退化阶段，从而提高RUL预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据驱动的RUL预测技术依赖于训练和测试数据来自同一分布的假设，这在实际工业环境中并不成立。以往的对抗域适应方法忽略了目标特定信息和退化阶段的不一致性特征，导致性能欠佳。

Method: 提出了TACDA方法，包括目标域重建策略和聚类配对策略。目标域重建策略在对抗适应过程中保留目标特定信息，聚类配对策略用于在相似退化阶段之间进行一致对齐。

Result: 通过大量实验，证明了TACDA方法在两个不同的评估指标上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: TACDA方法能够有效解决跨域RUL预测问题，并在性能上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/keyplay/TACDA.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的学习多任务策略的方法，用于遵循任意LTL指令，该方法解决了现有方法在多个高级事件可以同时为真并可能以复杂方式交互的环境中存在的不足。

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Conclusion: 标准的 Transformer 架构在处理比训练过程中遇到的更深层次的递归问题时表现不佳，因为它们无法维持栈式行为。所提出的循环定位和替换流水线有效地缓解了在分布外递归深度上进行测试时的性能衰减。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在情感理解方面取得了进展，但它们经常遭受推理漂移：模型逐渐依赖于自己生成的文本而不是多模态证据，并且它们的解释过度地受到视觉启动的推理路径的影响。

Method: 使用模态重要性 (MI)，MIGR 重新组织推理序列，以便解释从对目标情感最关键的模态开始，防止早期推理被不太有用的线索误导。我们的两阶段框架包括模态对齐的监督微调和模态感知的奖励优化，鼓励模型生成情感上扎根、因果相关和保持连贯性的解释。

Result: 在 DFEW 基准上的实验结果表明，MIGR 显着提高了推理可靠性，将伴随情感不一致解释的正确预测实例从 18.10% 降低到 7.37%。

Conclusion: 从情感主导模态开始推理是有益的。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在心理健康应用中表现出潜力，但其体积和计算需求阻碍了实际部署。小型语言模型（SLM）提供了一个轻量级的替代方案，但其在基于社交媒体的心理健康预测中的应用在很大程度上尚未被探索。

Method: Menta使用基于LoRA的框架、跨数据集策略和面向平衡准确性的损失，在六个分类任务上进行联合训练。

Result: 与九个最先进的SLM基线相比，Menta在涵盖抑郁、压力和自杀倾向的任务中，平均提高了15.2%。与13B参数的LLM相比，它在抑郁和压力分类任务上也实现了更高的准确率，同时体积缩小了约3.25倍。Menta在iPhone 15 Pro Max上实现了实时、设备上的部署，仅需约3GB的RAM。

Conclusion: Menta展示了可扩展、保护隐私的心理健康监测的潜力。

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

Method: 将新闻结构化为事件，并沿两个维度挖掘：水平整合每日事件，纵向跟踪捕获事件演变，以提取反映市场预期差异的增量信息。构建时间事件知识库。通过分析事件-价格动态，该框架进一步形成了因果经验的反射知识库。在预测方面，它检索类似的历史情景，并根据当前事件、增量数据和过去经验进行推理。

Result: StockMem优于现有的记忆架构，并通过追踪影响价格的信息链提供卓越的、可解释的推理。

Conclusion: StockMem提高了金融预测中决策的透明度。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的日记账分录测试(JETs)方法会产生大量误报，并且难以发现细微的违规行为。

Method: 使用LLaMA和Gemma等模型，在合成和真实的匿名账簿上进行基准测试，并与JETs和机器学习基线进行比较。

Result: LLMs始终优于传统的基于规则的JETs和经典的ML基线，同时还提供自然语言解释，从而增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: LLMs在增强财务审计完整性方面具有潜力，可以实现人机协作的AI增强审计。

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文将心理测量电池的模理论框架扩展到动力系统领域，将智能体形式化为由递归 GVU 算子控制的流，并推导出方差不等式，这是一种保证自提升稳定性的谱条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将 AAI 能力得分建立为智能体表征空间上的静态泛函。

Method: 将智能体形式化为由计算资源 r 参数化的流 ν_r，该流由递归生成器-验证器-更新器 (GVU) 算子控制。证明了该算子在参数流形 Θ 上生成一个向量场，并将自我改进系数 κ 识别为沿该流的能力泛函的李导数。

Result: 推导出方差不等式，这是一个谱条件，在温和的规律性下足以保证自我改进的稳定性。研究表明，κ> 0 的一个充分条件是，在曲率和步长效应的影响下，生成和验证的组合噪声必须足够小。

Conclusion: 将该形式主义应用于统一最近关于语言自博弈 (LSP)、自校正和合成数据引导的文献。证明了 STaR、SPIN、Reflexion、GAN 和 AlphaZero 等架构是 GVU 算子的特定拓扑实现，它们通过过滤、对抗性区分或在形式系统中进行 grounding 来满足方差不等式。

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Result: 通过一个概念验证模型生成的示例解释，该模型旨在解释在CelebA数据集上训练的分类器。

Conclusion: 通过清晰的、基于概念的词汇表来证明可理解性，服从于一个隐含的因果解释。通过强调重要的框架假设来解决保真度问题，强调解释解释的上下文必须与解释生成的上下文对齐。

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

Motivation: 现有的论文复现框架缺乏验证和改进机制，或过度依赖手动设计的提示，限制了适应性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用两个协作代理：验证代理检查每一步的输出是否满足系统提示的要求，改进代理基于发现的问题修改输出。不依赖人工设计的提示，仅利用原始系统提示实现自动验证和改进。

Conclusion: 提出的无需提示的协作方法在不同数据集上具有鲁棒性和一致性。

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

Conclusion: Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 过去二十年新发现减少，即使增加了投资，世界仍关注关键矿产勘探的能源转型。

Method: 提出了一种新的科学方法，该方法基于贝叶斯主义和证伪原则，将数据获取视为证伪人类假设的手段，并通过可验证的指标量化决策，进行理性决策。该方法依赖于新型无监督学习方法，以与领域专家合作，更好地理解数据并生成多个相互竞争的地质假设；以及人机协同人工智能算法，以优化规划各种地质、地球物理、地球化学和钻探数据采集。

*Zhonghao He,Tianyi Qiu,Hirokazu Shirado,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）推理中信念根深蒂固程度的系统框架。通过利用贝叶斯统计中的鞅属性，该框架可以检测LLM在推理过程中是否偏离了基于新证据进行更新的理性信念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理技术方面的进步提高了性能，但也引发了对其提供准确、真实和可靠信息能力的期望。然而，有证据表明，迭代推理可能会助长信念根深蒂固和确认偏差，而不是提高寻求真相的能力。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于回归的无监督鞅分数，用于衡量违反鞅属性的行为。鞅属性意味着，在理性信念更新下，未来信念的预期值应等于当前信念，即信念更新无法从当前信念中预测。

Result: 在事件预测、价值问题和学术论文评审等开放领域中，研究发现这种违规行为普遍存在于各种模型和设置中，当前信念可以积极预测未来信念的更新，这种现象被称为信念根深蒂固。研究人员确定了更容易产生信念根深蒂固的模型、推理技术和领域。

Conclusion: 该研究通过证明鞅分数可以预测问题领域中的真实准确性来验证鞅分数。这表明，鞅分数可以作为推理过程寻求真相能力的有用指标。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM控制方法在长上下文情况下仍然容易受到攻击，且越狱概率随上下文长度增加。需要更强大的LLM安全保障。

Method: 在LLM上下文中插入控制语句，作为一种入侵式上下文工程。

Result: 该方法不依赖于LLM训练，避免了长上下文训练中数据短缺的问题，并能推广到Chain-of-Thought过程中以防止阴谋。

Conclusion: 入侵式上下文工程是一种有潜力提高LLM在长上下文环境中安全性的方法。

Abstract: Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地调节在线交流，它们在培养共情和建设性对话方面的潜力成为了负责任的AI研究的重要前沿。

Method: 将调解分解为两个子任务：判断（评估对话的公平性和情感动态）和引导（生成共情、缓和升级的信息以引导参与者达成解决方案）。

Result: 实验表明，在进行调解时，基于API的模型在推理和干预对齐方面优于开源模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了当前大型语言模型作为在线社会调解新兴代理的希望和局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了Functorial-Categorical数据库（FCDb），它通过范畴论方法在保证数据一致性的同时避免信息丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库架构通常通过丢弃信息来保证本地一致性，将正确性与损失纠缠在一起。

Method: 将数据操作建模为分层函子范畴中的态射，并建立一个完整的保持族（CPF）投影，该投影跨越内容不变性（CAS）、能力和所有权，以及可选的观察投影，用于本地顺序（B+Tree）、时间历史（仅追加/LSM）和邻接（图）。

Result: 确定了一个最小内核（F_core = Own o Cap o CAS），它可以保留信息并将非交换性折叠到伦理授予/撤销边界。在伴随提升和纤维结构下，操作对在范畴极限中交换，同时保持所有权完整性和能力约束。

Conclusion: 该框架通过投影解释连接到信息几何，并支持实证验证，而不会丢弃语义、时间或关系熵。

Abstract: Conventional database architectures often secure local consistency by discarding information, entangling correctness with loss. We introduce the Functorial-Categorical Database (FCDb), which models data operations as morphisms in a layered functor category and establishes a Complete Preserving Family (CPF) of projections spanning content invariance (CAS), capability, and ownership, with optional observational projections for local order (B+Tree), temporal history (append-only/LSM), and adjacency (Graph). We identify a minimal kernel (F_core = Own o Cap o CAS) that preserves information and collapses non-commutativity to the ethical grant/revoke boundary. Under adjoint lifts and a fibred structure, operational pairs commute in the categorical limit while ownership integrity and capability constraints are maintained. The framework connects to information geometry via projection interpretations and supports empirical validation without discarding semantic, temporal, or relational entropy.

Method: 设计 Trinity 框架，包含：为 PD 分离中部署 GPU 向量搜索服务的新架构；用于向量搜索的连续批处理；感知阶段的调度。

Result: Trinity 框架将所有检索整合到一个共享的向量搜索 GPU 池中，并使其与 PD 分离的 LLM 服务相匹配。

Conclusion: Trinity 框架在 PD 分离的 LLM 服务中有效整合了向量搜索。

Abstract: Prefill and decode (PD) disaggregation separates prompt prefill and token-by-token decode stages into distinct GPU pools and has become the dominant architecture for large-scale LLM serving in industry. Also, retrieval tasks via vector search remains entangled with the model inference process, like heterogeneous RAG requests and prompt answer caches, inflating tail latency. We are motivated to investigate how vector search should be orchestrated along with PD disaggregation with a dedicated deployment architecture without violating SLOs in various retrieval workloads. We present Trinity, a practical framework that consolidates all retrieval into a single, shared vector-search GPU pool and make it work with PD disaggregated LLM serving in match. Trinity introduces (1) a novel architecture for deploying GPU-based vector search service in PD disaggregation. (2) Continuous batching for vector search that make full used of GPUs under heterogeneous queries; (3) Stage-aware scheduling that preempts vector search requests between both decode and prefill tasks.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: MOAR is a new optimizer for DocETL that optimizes for both accuracy and cost by introducing new rewrite directives and a global search algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often give inaccurate results due to complexity in the operator or the data it operates on. DocETL only optimizes for accuracy, not cost.

Method: MOAR introduces two new categories of directives and extends all three existing categories with new ones. It also designs a new global search algorithm that explores rewrites in the context of entire pipelines and adapts a multi-armed bandit framework to prioritize which pipelines to rewrite.

Result: MOAR achieves 27% higher accuracy than ABACUS, the next-best optimizer, while matching its best accuracy at 55% of its cost.

Conclusion: MOAR is a cost-effective optimizer for DocETL that improves accuracy and reduces cost.

Abstract: One year ago, we open-sourced DocETL, a declarative system for LLM-powered data processing that, as of November 2025, has 3.2K GitHub stars and users across domains (e.g., journalism, law, medicine, policy, finance, and urban planning). In DocETL, users build pipelines by composing operators described in natural language, also known as semantic operators, with an LLM executing each operator's logic. However, due to complexity in the operator or the data it operates on, LLMs often give inaccurate results. To address this challenge, DocETL introduced rewrite directives, or abstract rules that guide LLM agents in rewriting pipelines by decomposing operators or data. For example, decomposing a single filter("is this email sent from an executive and discussing fraud?") into the conjunction of two separate semantic filters may improve accuracy. However, DocETL only optimizes for accuracy, not cost. How do we optimize for both?
  We present MOAR (Multi-Objective Agentic Rewrites), a new optimizer for DocETL. To target cost optimization, we introduce two new categories of directives and extend all three existing categories with new ones, bringing the total to over 30 directives -- more than doubling what DocETL originally had. Moreover, since operators can interact with each other unpredictably due to LLM behavior, optimizing operators or sub-pipelines individually can yield suboptimal overall plans. Recognizing this, we design a new global search algorithm that explores rewrites in the context of entire pipelines. Since the space of rewrites is infinite -- pipelines can be rewritten in many ways, and each rewritten pipeline can itself be rewritten -- our algorithm adapts a multi-armed bandit framework to prioritize which pipelines to rewrite. Across six workloads, MOAR achieves 27% higher accuracy than ABACUS, the next-best optimizer, while matching its best accuracy at 55% of its cost.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: QJoin是一个使用强化学习框架来学习和重用跨连接任务的转换策略的系统，以解决在异构数据集中发现可连接表的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连接发现方法主要为等值连接设计，但在开放或联邦设置中，当标识符格式不一致、嵌入或拆分在多个列中时，这些技术会失效。近似或模糊连接可以缓解细微的字符串变化，但无法捕获系统转换。

Method: QJoin训练一个代理，该代理在唯一性感知奖励下平衡相似性与键的独特性，使其能够探索简洁、高价值的转换链。为了加速新的连接，引入了两种重用机制：(i) 代理转移，从预训练的代理初始化新的策略，以及 (ii) 转换重用，为类似的列集群缓存成功的操作符序列。

Result: 在AutoJoin Web基准测试（31个表对）中，QJoin实现了91.0%的平均F1分数。对于NYC+Chicago开放数据集中的19,990个连接任务，通过重用，QJoin最多可将运行时间减少7.4%（13,747秒）。

Conclusion: 结果表明，转换学习和重用可以使连接发现更准确、更高效。

Abstract: Discovering which tables in large, heterogeneous repositories can be joined and by what transformations is a central challenge in data integration and data discovery. Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient.

In this paper, we present a Datalake infrastructure tailored to the needs of interdisciplinary social science research. Our system supports ingestion and integration of diverse data types, automatic provenance and version tracking, role-based access control, and built-in tools for visualization and analysis. We demonstrate the utility of our Datalake using real-world use cases spanning governance, health, and education. A detailed walkthrough of one such use case -- analyzing the relationship between income, education, and infant mortality -- shows how our platform streamlines the research process while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. We argue that such infrastructure can democratize access to advanced data science practices, especially for NGOs, students, and grassroots organizations. The Datalake continues to evolve with plans to support ML pipelines, mobile access, and citizen data feedback mechanisms.

Motivation: 在医疗、公共政策和经济等领域，基于观察数据得出的因果分析至关重要，但这些结论可能非常脆弱，即使是轻微的数据错误也可能极大地改变因果关系。因此，需要评估因果声明对数据中小型、有针对性的修改的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了SubCure框架，通过基数修复进行鲁棒性审计。该框架识别删除哪些元组或子群体可以将估计的因果效应转移到目标范围内。此外，还开发了高效的算法，结合了机器学习取消学习技术，以增量方式更新因果估计，而无需从头开始重新训练。

Result: 在四个涵盖不同应用领域的真实世界数据集上评估了SubCure。结果表明，SubCure能够发现紧凑、高影响的子集，删除这些子集会显著改变因果结论，揭示传统方法无法检测到的漏洞。

Conclusion: 基数修复是压力测试因果分析和防止源于普通数据缺陷的误导性声明的强大且通用的工具。

Abstract: Causal analyses derived from observational data underpin high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, public policy, and economics. Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections.

TL;DR: PystachIO: A PyTorch-based distributed OLAP engine that combines fast network and storage I/O with key optimizations to maximize GPU, network, and storage utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data centers are adopting HPC-style architectures for AI, but existing Tensor computation runtimes (TCRs) don't efficiently handle large-scale, storage-resident OLAP workloads.

Method: Developed PystachIO, a PyTorch-based distributed OLAP engine that combines fast network and storage I/O with key optimizations.

Result: Achieved up to 3x end-to-end speedups over existing distributed GPU-based query processing approaches.

Conclusion: PystachIO effectively addresses the challenges of using TCRs for scalable, distributed query processing of large-scale, storage-resident OLAP workloads by maximizing GPU, network, and storage utilization.

Abstract: The AI hardware boom has led modern data centers to adopt HPC-style architectures centered on distributed, GPU-centric computation. Large GPU clusters interconnected by fast RDMA networks and backed by high-bandwidth NVMe storage enable scalable computation and rapid access to storage-resident data. Tensor computation runtimes (TCRs), such as PyTorch, originally designed for AI workloads, have recently been shown to accelerate analytical workloads. However, prior work has primarily considered settings where the data fits in aggregated GPU memory. In this paper, we systematically study how TCRs can support scalable, distributed query processing for large-scale, storage-resident OLAP workloads. Although TCRs provide abstractions for network and storage I/O, naive use often underutilizes GPU and I/O bandwidth due to insufficient overlap between computation and data movement. As a core contribution, we present PystachIO, a PyTorch-based distributed OLAP engine that combines fast network and storage I/O with key optimizations to maximize GPU, network, and storage utilization. Our evaluation shows up to 3x end-to-end speedups over existing distributed GPU-based query processing approaches.

*H. R. Paz*

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个针对拉丁美洲公立大学工程系学生数据的三阶段标准化流程，时间跨度为 1980-2019 年。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据驱动的决策中，纵向大学管理记录的使用日益增长，但常常忽略了原始、不一致的数据在建模前的标准化处理。

Method: 该流程包括：(i) N1 CENSAL，将人口统计数据协调到单个人员层面；(ii) N1b IDENTITY RESOLUTION，将重复的标识符合并为一个规范 ID，同时保留审计跟踪；(iii) N1c GEO 和 SECONDARY-SCHOOL NORMALISATION，构建参考表，对学校类型进行分类，并将无法恢复的案例标记为 DATA_MISSING。

Result: 该流程保留了 100% 的学生数据，实现了完全的地理编码，并为 56.6% 的人口生成了有效的学校类型。剩余的 43.4% 被识别为结构性缺失。

Conclusion: 本文贡献：(a) 一个透明、可复制的、针对高等教育的标准化流程；(b) 一个在不进行推测性插补的情况下处理结构性缺失信息的框架；(c) 关于定义分析上连贯的队列（完整人口与知情的二级学校子队列）的指南，用于下游学习分析和政策评估。

Abstract: The growing use of longitudinal university administrative records in data-driven decision-making often overlooks a critical layer: how raw, inconsistent data are normalised before modelling. This article presents a three-stage normalisation pipeline for a dataset of 24,133 engineering students at a Latin American public university, spanning four decades (1980-2019). The pipeline comprises: (i) N1 CENSAL, harmonising demographics into a single person-level layer; (ii) N1b IDENTITY RESOLUTION, consolidating duplicate identifiers into a canonical ID while preserving an audit trail; and (iii) N1c GEO and SECONDARY-SCHOOL NORMALISATION, which builds reference tables, classifies school types (state national, state provincial, private secular, private religious), and flags irrecoverable cases as DATA_MISSING. The pipeline preserves 100% of students, achieves full geocoding, and yields valid school types for 56.6% of the population. The remaining 43.4% are identified as structurally missing due to legacy enrolment practices rather than stochastic non-response. Forensic analysis (chi-square, logistic regression) shows missingness is highly predictable from entry decade and geography, confirming a structural, historically induced mechanism. The article contributes: (a) a transparent, reproducible normalisation pipeline tailored to higher education; (b) a framework for treating structurally missing information without speculative imputation; and (c) guidance on defining analytically coherent cohorts (full population vs. secondary-school-informed subcohorts) for downstream learning analytics and policy evaluation.

### [143] [Q-BERT4Rec: Quantized Semantic-ID Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02474)
*Haofeng Huang,Ling Gai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了Q-Bert4Rec，一个多模态序列推荐框架，它统一了语义表示和量化建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的方法依赖于缺乏语义意义的离散项目ID，忽略了丰富的多模态信息（例如，文本和图像），导致泛化能力弱和可解释性有限。

Method: Q-Bert4Rec包含三个阶段：（1）跨模态语义注入，通过动态Transformer融合文本、视觉和结构特征，丰富随机初始化的ID嵌入；（2）语义量化，通过残差向量量化将融合的表示离散化为有意义的tokens；（3）多掩码预训练和微调，利用不同的掩码策略——span、tail和multi-region——来提高序列理解。

Result: 在公共Amazon基准测试中验证了模型，结果表明Q-Bert4Rec显著优于许多现有的强方法。

Conclusion: 证实了语义tokenization对于多模态序列推荐的有效性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation plays a critical role in modern online platforms such as e-commerce, advertising, and content streaming, where accurately predicting users' next interactions is essential for personalization. Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为AskNearby的AI驱动社区应用，旨在解决“15分钟城市”中本地生活信息可访问性（LLIA）问题，帮助居民更有效地发现本地资源，规划日常活动和参与社区生活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于位置的系统主要关注城市级任务，忽略了影响本地决策的空间、时间和认知因素。

Method: AskNearby集成了三层检索增强生成（RAG）管道，协同基于图、语义向量和地理检索，以及一个编码用户邻里熟悉度和偏好的认知地图模型。

Result: 在真实社区数据集上的实验表明，AskNearby在检索准确性和推荐质量方面显著优于基于LLM和基于地图的基线，并在时空定位和认知感知排名方面实现了稳健的性能。真实部署进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AskNearby通过解决LLIA挑战，帮助居民更有效地发现本地资源，规划日常活动和参与社区生活。

Abstract: The "15-minute city" envisions neighborhoods where residents can meet daily needs via a short walk or bike ride. Realizing this vision requires not only physical proximity but also efficient and reliable access to information about nearby places, services, and events. Existing location-based systems, however, focus mainly on city-level tasks and neglect the spatial, temporal, and cognitive factors that shape localized decision-making. We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking. Real-world deployments further validate its effectiveness. By addressing the LLIA challenge, AskNearby empowers residents to more effectively discover local resources, plan daily activities, and engage in community life.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat relevance as a monolithic task, limiting performance. LORE decomposes relevance into knowledge/reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence.

Method: A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL.

Result: A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities.

Conclusion: LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle and serves as a practical solution and methodological reference.

Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

Abstract: Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance. To improve prediction performance, both individual models and ensemble techniques such as stacking were investigated. The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.The stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision. In our study, we proposed and developed a React Native-based application with a Python Flask backend to support early diabetes prediction, providing users with an accessible and efficient health monitoring tool.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于药效团的虚拟筛选在处理大型分子库时效率低下，且候选化合物仅限于现有分子库。

Method: 提出了一种新的体素 captioning 方法 VoxCap，用于从体素化分子表示生成 SMILES 字符串，并提出了两种工作流程：de-novo 设计和快速搜索。

Result: VoxCap 在生成多样化的 de-novo 命中方面优于以前的方法，并且与快速搜索工作流程结合使用时，VoxCap 可将计算时间减少几个数量级。

Conclusion: VoxCap 能够搜索大型分子库，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的方法 PIBNet 来近似求解边界上的解轨迹，从而加速边界元法 (BEM) 的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边界元法 (BEM) 在求解无界均匀域中的多重散射问题时非常有效，因为它将离散化简到域边界，从而降低了计算复杂度。然而，BEM 的第一步是主要的计算瓶颈。

Method: 该方法利用受物理启发式图策略来有效地模拟障碍物及其远程交互。然后，我们介绍了一种新的多尺度图神经网络结构来模拟多重散射。

Result: 结果表明，我们的方法不仅超越了现有最先进的基于学习的方法，而且在具有更多障碍物的设置中表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PIBNet 是一种很有前途的 BEM 加速方法，尤其是在多重散射问题中。

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将辅助结构特征直接整合到预训练Transformer的自注意力机制中，从而在歌词内容分类的特征融合方面取得显著的架构进步。

Method: 该模型利用上下文门控机制（一个中间SFL）来调节BERT编码器堆栈中的隐藏状态序列，而不是在最终输出层融合特征。这种方法使用低维结构线索（Fstruct）来调节深度上下文语义特征（Hseq）。

Result: SFL Transformer在UMAP降维歌词嵌入导出的二元分类任务中，实现了0.9910的准确率和0.9910的Macro F1分数，显著提高了先前发布的SFL模型的性能（准确率为0.9894）。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了在堆栈中间注入辅助上下文是协同结合结构和语义信息的最有效手段的假设，从而创建了一个具有卓越判别能力和高保真概率估计的模型。

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Motivation: 现有图异常检测模型忽略了普遍存在的节点属性缺失和对抗性模糊问题，这些问题会破坏聚合稳定性和预测可靠性。

Method: 将每个节点的邻居划分为三个基于标签的组，对标记组应用特定于组的转换，同时节点条件门处理未知数，通过残差连接融合消息，并使用二元分类目标进行端到端训练，以提高缺失属性下的聚合稳定性和预测可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺失属性下提高了聚合稳定性和预测可靠性，并在欺诈检测数据集中表现出有效性，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Motivation: 工业界在工程领域应用人工智能(AI4E)面临两个根本瓶颈：高质量数据稀缺和黑盒模型缺乏可解释性，这在航空航天等安全敏感领域尤为重要。

Method: 首先，通过一个三阶段协议增强物理上合理的合成数据：校准到过程可变性的差异化噪声注入、硬物理约束的执行以及参数间关系的保持。然后，采用嵌套优化策略进行本构模型发现，其中符号回归探索方程结构，而差分进化优化参数，然后使用混合全局-局部优化进行参数精细化。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发可信赖的AI系统提供了一个通用蓝图，该系统将工程领域知识直接嵌入到其架构中，从而能够在数据有限但物理理解可用的高风险工业应用中可靠地采用。

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应高斯混合专家模型（Ada-MoGE），用于解决多元时间序列预测中传统MoE模型无法适应频率变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合专家模型(MoE)由于专家数量固定，难以适应时间序列中不断变化的频谱分布，导致频率覆盖不平衡的问题，专家数量不足或过多都会导致问题。

Method: Ada-MoGE模型结合了谱强度和频率响应来动态确定专家数量，并通过高斯带通滤波平滑地分解频域特征。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试中，Ada-MoGE模型以仅20万个参数实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该模型能够自适应地调整专家数量，更好地适应输入数据的频率分布，避免信息丢失和噪声污染。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

TL;DR: GraphMatch是一个新的推荐框架，它融合了预训练的语言模型和图神经网络，以应对富文本、动态双边市场的推荐挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法侧重于独立的模型，未能充分利用文本和图结构的信息。本文旨在弥合预训练语言模型和大规模图之间的差距。

Method: GraphMatch采用对抗负采样和时间点子图训练，学习能够捕捉细粒度文本语义和时间敏感图结构的表示。

Result: GraphMatch在匹配任务上优于单独使用语言模型或图神经网络的基线方法，并且在运行时效率很高。

Conclusion: 统一语言和图表示可以为富文本、动态双边推荐提供高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

*Li Qianyang,Zhang Xingjun,Wang Shaoxun,Wei Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPWMixer，一个用于长期时间序列预测（LTSF）的计算高效的双路径架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在捕获远程依赖性方面有效，但由于数据稀疏性，它们经常遭受二次复杂性和过度拟合。另一方面，有效的线性模型难以描绘复杂的非线性局部动态。现有的多尺度框架通常依赖于平均池化，导致频谱混叠和高频瞬态的不可逆转的损失。

Method: 该方法构建于无损Haar小波金字塔之上，该金字塔利用正交分解来显式地分离趋势和局部波动，而不会造成信息丢失。为了处理这些组件，我们设计了一个双路径趋势混合器，该混合器集成了用于宏趋势锚定的全局线性映射和用于微动态演化的灵活的基于patch的MLP-Mixer。

Result: 在八个公共基准上进行的大量实验表明，该方法比state-of-the-art基线实现了持续的改进。

Conclusion: DPWMixer在长期时间序列预测任务上表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有的 GCL 方法通常难以识别任务相关的拓扑结构，更不用说适应不同下游任务中所需的不同粗细粒度拓扑粒度。

Method: 利用同一图的变换来生成多尺度环状细胞复合体，并提出了一种多粒度解耦对比和应用基于不确定性估计的粒度特异性加权机制。

Result: 在各种基准上的综合实验证明了 HTG-GCL 的有效性，突出了其通过分层拓扑信息捕获有意义的图表示的卓越性能。

Conclusion: HTG-GCL 能够通过分层拓扑信息捕获有意义的图表示，并在各种基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务驱动的监督多模态联邦特征提取方法，用于解决多模态数据回归中的特征提取问题，尤其是在数据有限、非独立同分布以及模型容易发生灾难性遗忘的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际场景中多模态数据回归的三个核心挑战：数据有限和非独立同分布、多模态信息的有效提取和融合、以及模型学习中容易发生的灾难性遗忘。

Method: 该方法整合了多模态信息提取和对比学习机制，并可以适应不同的神经网络结构作为每个模态数据的潜在映射函数。它支持每个客户端独立学习多模态数据的低维表示，并且可以通过参数调整灵活地控制预测变量中关于响应变量的有效信息的保留程度。通过互信息保留约束、对称Kullback-Leibler散度约束和模型间对比约束的协同作用，实现了任务相关信息的保留、多模态特征的提取、融合和对齐，以及非独立同分布场景下表示漂移和灾难性遗忘的缓解。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多重约束学习框架，保证了回归精度，并确保特征提取过程始终以提高下游回归任务的性能为中心。

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.

Motivation: 考察自主定价算法在实际需求条件下的行为，以及算法、市场结构和随机需求如何共同影响竞争结果。

Method: 分析了四种定价算法（Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, DDPG）在三种双寡头模型（Logit, Hotelling, Linear）和不同需求冲击机制下的表现，并使用基于利润和价格的合谋指数进行评估。

Result: 强化学习算法在稳定需求下通常维持超竞争价格，DDPG表现出最明显的合谋倾向。需求冲击对不同市场产生不同影响：Logit市场表现显著下降，Hotelling市场保持稳定，Linear市场经历冲击引起的利润膨胀。

Conclusion: 市场结构和需求不确定性在塑造算法竞争中至关重要，并为围绕自主定价行为的政策讨论做出贡献。

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的对比学习方法，即临床指导的对比学习（CLEF），用于预训练心电图（ECG）基础模型。该方法利用临床风险评分来调整负样本对的权重，从而使ECG嵌入的相似性与受试者之间具有临床意义的差异相一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法没有结合来自临床元数据的领域知识，而这些知识对于提高诊断性能至关重要。

Method: 该方法使用对比学习，并利用临床风险评分自适应地调整负样本对的权重。此外，该方法还具有处理缺失元数据的显式机制。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，CLEF在18个临床分类和回归任务中，优于其他基础模型和自监督算法。当在12导联ECG数据上进行预训练并在I导联数据上进行测试时，CLEF在分类任务中的AUROC平均提高了至少2.6%，在回归任务中的MAE平均降低了至少3.2%。

Conclusion: CLEF能够实现更准确和可扩展的单导联ECG分析，从而推进远程健康监测。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

Motivation: 先前稀疏自编码器 (SAE) 的学习特征在不同种子和超参数设置下变化很大。

Method: 本文提出的OSAE方法，通过(1)建立潜在特征的严格排序；(2)确定性地使用每个特征维度，避免了先前嵌套SAE方法的基于采样的近似。

Result: 在Gemma2-2B和Pythia-70M上的实验表明，与Matryoshka基线相比，OSAE可以帮助提高一致性。

Conclusion: OSAE可以提高模型的可解释性和一致性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

Method: 该方法结合了LLM驱动的文本生成与双层质量过滤机制：基于检索增强生成(RAG)的n-shot prompting的自动过滤层，以及人工验证层。

Result: InstructLR创建了三个多领域指令基准：ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, 和 FulfuldeInstruct-50k。

Conclusion: InstructLR框架能够为低资源语言生成高质量的指令数据集。

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence safety-critical aspects of society, from medical diagnosis to autonomous mobility, making uncertainty awareness a central requirement for trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

Motivation: 在医疗领域，可靠的机器学习需要预测性能、公平性和可解释性。提高公平性对预测性能的影响是已知的，但对可解释性的影响知之甚少。临床医生可能不愿意依赖于在应用公平性约束后解释发生变化的模型。

Method: 通过偏差缓解技术来增强公平性，并研究Shapley值特征排序的变化。在三个数据集上量化应用公平性约束后特征重要性排序的变化：儿童尿路感染风险、直接抗凝剂出血风险和累犯风险。评估多个模型类别在基于Shapley值的排序的稳定性。

Result: 提高模型在种族亚组间的公平性会显著改变特征重要性排序，有时不同组之间的方式不同。

Conclusion: 在模型评估中，需要同时考虑准确性、公平性和可解释性，而不是孤立地考虑。

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究会员查询在加速学习任务中的作用，特别是在分布特定设置中。

Method: 从基于样本的布尔概念类的反驳，到带查询的可测试学习（TL-Q）的一般归约。

Result: 相对于概念类和分布族，没有m样本TL-Q算法在时间效率上能超多项式地优于最佳m样本PAC学习器。

Conclusion: 定义了一类“统计”MQ算法，并表明此类中的TL-Q算法意味着有效的统计查询反驳和学习算法。

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

Result: 模型在1k-10k训练步内迅速将等变误差降低到≤2%的预留损失，且该结果对模型和数据集大小具有鲁棒性。学习3D旋转等变性比主要预测任务更容易，损失情况更平滑，条件更好。非等变模型的损失惩罚在整个训练过程中都很小，因此它们可能比每个GPU-hour的等变模型实现更低的测试损失，除非等变的“效率差距”缩小。

Conclusion: 学习3D旋转等变性是一个相对容易的任务，但非等变模型可能在计算效率上更具优势，除非等变模型的效率得到提升。

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

### [170] [Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323)
*Kentaro Kubo,Hayato Goto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的玻尔兹曼机（BM）训练框架，通过结合Langevin SB（LSB）采样器和条件期望匹配（CEM）方法，实现了比受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）更强大的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的玻尔兹曼机训练成本高，限制了其在实际应用中的使用。精确的学习通常需要马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）玻尔兹曼采样，但对于更具表达能力的模型，由于难以并行化，因此非常耗时。

Method: 1. 提出了受量子启发组合优化算法模拟分岔（SB）启发的Langevin SB（LSB）采样器，实现并行化采样，同时保持与MCMC相当的精度。2. 开发了一种有效的反温度估计方法，称为条件期望匹配（CEM），以克服LSB无法控制输出玻尔兹曼分布的反温度的限制。3. 将LSB和CEM结合，建立了一个高效的BM学习框架，称为sampler-adaptive learning（SAL）。

Result: Langevin SB（LSB）采样器，实现并行化采样，同时保持与MCMC相当的精度。条件期望匹配（CEM）克服LSB无法控制输出玻尔兹曼分布的反温度的限制。

Conclusion: SAL为超越RBM的基于能量的生成建模开辟了新途径，为能量模型开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

Motivation: 研究检索增强模型在具有概念漂移的流监督学习中的应用。

Method: 提出了 RAM-OL，一种基于随机梯度下降的简单扩展方法，它维护一个过去示例的小缓冲区，并在隐藏表示空间中检索当前输入的最近邻，然后联合更新模型。

Result: 在电力定价、电力负荷和航delay数据等真实世界数据流上进行了评估，结果表明，在强烈和周期性漂移的流上，RAM-OL 将预序准确率提高了约 7 个百分点，并大大降低了随机种子之间的方差。在嘈杂的航线流上，门控变体与纯在线基线非常匹配。

Conclusion: 检索增强记忆是概念漂移下在线学习的一种实用且稳健的工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

Motivation: 长上下文生成对于大型语言模型（LLM）至关重要，但验证过程在高上下文长度下成为瓶颈，减缓了生成速度。

Method: 提出SpecPV，一种自推测解码方法，使用部分KV状态进行快速验证，并定期进行完整验证。

Result: SpecPV在多个长上下文基准测试和模型（包括LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-series）上实现了高达6倍于标准自回归解码的加速，且性能略有下降。

Conclusion: SpecPV通过快速验证和定期完整验证，显著加速了长上下文生成中的推测解码，同时保持了可接受的性能水平。

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

Conclusion: 所提出的FOVA算法能够有效提高离线联邦强化学习在混合质量数据下的性能。

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: GPOMDP 算法只需要马尔可夫链的单个样本路径，只需要一个自由参数，并且不需要知道底层状态。

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESACT: An end-to-end sparse transformer accelerator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of Transformers hinders efficient hardware deployment. Existing accelerators either exploit only intra-row sparsity or rely on costly global similarity estimation, diminishing the benefits of sparsity.

Method: Proposes ESACT, an end-to-end sparse accelerator, centering on Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism, which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation.

Result: SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss. ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W, and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

Conclusion: ESACT is an efficient end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通过动态配置路边停车位来减少交通拥堵的有效方法。

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

Motivation: 探讨数据中心策略（如数据剪枝、合成数据生成等）在提高训练效率和下游性能方面的作用，尤其关注自生成合成数据常常无法有效提升模型能力的问题。

Method: 将数据管理形式化为重加权抽样分布，并将其影响映射到数据诱导算子的特征结构上，分析静态剪枝和时变数据管理。

Result: 静态剪枝会产生一个有界算子，不能改变谱尾指数，只能提供有限区域的改进；理想的时变数据管理可以通过跟踪谱残差和重新归一化尾部来加速学习。

Conclusion: 静态数据剪枝对于改变神经模型的渐近缩放效果有限，而时变数据管理在理想情况下可以加速学习，但实际应用中只能近似实现这种效果。

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

Conclusion: 动力学对齐和价值对齐对于策略学习至关重要，DVDF方法能够有效地提高跨域离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Motivation: 现有工作主要集中在评估LLM在长上下文提示下的能力，而对agentic设置的探索相对不足，尤其是在能力和安全方面。

Method: 通过实验评估LLM agents在长上下文中的表现，关注任务性能和拒绝执行有害请求的变化。

Result: 1M-2M token上下文窗口的模型在100K tokens时就出现严重性能下降，良性和有害任务的性能下降超过50%。拒绝率也发生不可预测的变化。

Conclusion: LLM agents在长上下文中存在潜在的安全问题，并对当前评估LLM agent在长多步任务中的安全性的指标和范式提出了质疑。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

Result: 在哥德堡数据集上验证，TabGRU模型优于深度学习基线，在Torp站点和Barl站点分别达到0.91和0.96的R2。

Conclusion: TabGRU模型能有效克服传统方法的局限性，为基于CML的城市降雨监测提供了一种稳健而精确的解决方案。

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否具有利他主义倾向，以及它们的内隐关联和自我报告是否能预测实际的利他主义行为。

Method: 使用受人类社会心理学启发的多方法方法，测试了24个前沿LLM，包括内隐关联测试(IAT)、强制二元选择任务和自我评估量表。

Result: 所有模型都表现出强烈的内隐亲利他主义偏见；模型的行为比随机情况更利他；内隐关联不能预测行为；模型系统性地高估了自己的利他主义。

Conclusion: 建议将校准差距（自我报告和行为价值观之间的差异）作为标准化的对齐指标。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

Conclusion: 所提出的DMTFL算法能够有效提高VR视频传输的质量和效率。

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

Motivation: 传统核方法计算复杂度高，针对大规模数据集，通常采用张量积结构的 polynomial 和 Fourier 特征将数据映射到高维空间，并通过张量网络重参数化解决维度灾难问题。但是，特征超参数的优化通常使用标准交叉验证方法，效率较低。

Method: 将张量积特征表示为可学习的 Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD)，并使用交替最小二乘 (ALS) 优化方法学习与不同特征相关的超参数以及模型参数。

Result: 在各种维度和规模的真实数据上的实验表明，FL 模型的训练速度比标准交叉验证模型快 3-5 倍，并且预测质量相当。

Conclusion: FL 模型通过学习张量积特征的 CPD 分解，能够有效且高效地学习特征超参数，从而提升模型训练效率和预测性能。

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

Result: CUDA-L2在离线和服务器模式下均优于torch.matmul、cuBLAS和cuBLASLt。

Conclusion: 即使是像HGEMM这样对性能要求最高的内核，也可以通过LLM引导的RL自动化来改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

TL;DR: GoRL: A reinforcement learning framework decoupling optimization from generation for stable and expressive policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian policies are stable but lack expressiveness for complex control, while generative policies are expressive but unstable in online RL.

Method: Optimizes a tractable latent policy and uses a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions with a two-timescale update schedule.

Result: GoRL outperforms Gaussian policies and generative-policy baselines across continuous-control tasks, achieving significantly higher returns on HopperStand.

Conclusion: Separating optimization from generation leads to RL policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

TL;DR: 提出了 HeatTransFormer，一种用于界面主导扩散问题的物理引导 Transformer 架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体器件中的热传递主要由芯片和衬底组件决定，其中有限芯片层内产生的热量会消散到具有更高热物理性质的半无限衬底中。这种不匹配会产生陡峭的界面温度梯度，使得瞬态热响应对界面高度敏感。传统的数值求解器需要过多的离散化来解决这些动态问题，而物理信息神经网络 (PINN) 通常表现出不稳定的收敛性以及材料界面附近物理一致性的丧失。

Method: 该框架集成了物理信息时空采样、模拟分析扩散解决方案的基于拉普拉斯的激活以及支持双向时空耦合的无掩码注意力机制。

Result: HeatTransFormer 在应用于有限层和半无限衬底配置时，会在整个界面上产生相干的温度场。与物理约束反演策略相结合，它还可以仅使用外部测量同时可靠地识别三个未知的热属性。

Conclusion: 物理引导的 Transformer 架构为界面主导的热系统中的正向和反向建模提供了一个统一的框架。

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Conclusion: Adapt-TKM特别适用于资源受限的可穿戴设备。

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

Motivation: 现有基于大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的VLN智能体常常遭受感知错误、推理错误和规划错误的困扰，这严重阻碍了它们的导航性能。

Method: 1. 引入双视角视觉提示（VP）技术，以减少VLN智能体视觉模块的感知幻觉，并提高智能体对当前空间状态的理解。

Conclusion: 所提出的SeeNav-Agent框架，通过双视角视觉提示和步奖励组策略优化，显著提高了VLN智能体的导航性能，并在训练稳定性和泛化能力方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型（如扩散模型和基于flow的模型）在计算单个似然时仍然需要数百到数千个神经函数评估（NFEs），并且现有的蒸馏方法以牺牲似然可追踪性为代价来实现加速采样。

Method: 通过联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，使用单个模型来减少采样和似然评估所需的NFEs数量。

Result: F2D2能够在少步评估中实现准确的对数似然，同时保持较高的样本质量。

Conclusion: F2D2 解决了基于 flow 的生成模型中长期存在的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations. Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模生成模型的负责任部署和维护提供了一条可行的途径，使行业能够以实用和有效的方式遵守持续的数据删除请求。

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.
