### [1] [Collaborative and Proactive Management of Task-Oriented Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05110)
*Arezoo Saedi,Afsaneh Fatemi,Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh,Sophie Rosset,Anne Vilnat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息状态的面向任务对话系统模型，该模型利用大型语言模型（LLM）的上下文学习能力，通过构建中间信息状态来实现有效的目标感知规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面向任务对话系统（TOD）忽略了有效的目标感知规划，而主动规划对于完成任务至关重要。

Method: 该模型首先创建预定义的槽位和文本部分信息组件来模拟用户偏好，然后识别关键情况并创建相应的信息组件。信息组件的可能配置导致有限的信息状态。接着，创建对话move，表明这些信息状态之间的移动以及在移动中必须执行的过程。最后，构建更新策略。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型在inform和success指标上都达到了最大值，并且与以前的方法相比有所改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出的模型能够有效地管理面向任务的对话，并在单领域对话中取得了较好的效果。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

### [2] [Trainable Reference-Based Evaluation Metric for Identifying Quality of English-Gujarati Machine Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05113)
*Nisheeth Joshi,Pragya Katyayan,Palak Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于监督学习的古吉拉特语参考式机器翻译(MT)评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译评估方法在英语和欧洲语言上表现良好，但在印度语言上效果不佳。

Method: 该方法基于监督学习，使用25个特征训练了两个版本的指标，一个模型使用6个隐藏层，另一个使用10个隐藏层，均训练500个epoch。

Result: 该指标在与现有指标的比较中表现出更好的人工相关性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的指标优于现有指标

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

### [3] [Hallucination is Inevitable for LLMs with the Open World Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05116)
*Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文将大型语言模型（LLM）的“幻觉”现象重新定义为泛化问题，认为在开放世界假设下，幻觉是不可避免的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）中普遍存在的“幻觉”现象，并指出以往的工程方法和形式分析视角都未能充分解释其在通用人工智能（AGI）发展中的地位。

Method: 通过区分在封闭世界和开放世界假设下幻觉的可避免性，对幻觉进行了分类。

Result: 提出在开放世界中幻觉是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 建议将“幻觉”视为一种结构性特征，容忍它并使其与人类智能相兼容，而不仅仅是将其视为工程缺陷。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

### [4] [Towards Structured Knowledge: Advancing Triple Extraction from Regional Trade Agreements using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05121)
*Durgesh Nandini,Rebekka Koch,Mirco Schoenfeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在经济领域提取主谓宾三元组形式的结构化知识的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自然语言法律贸易协定文本创建经济贸易知识图谱。

Method: 使用 Llama 3.1 模型处理非结构化的区域贸易协定文本并提取三元组，并探讨了零样本、一次样本和少样本提示技术，结合正面和负面例子，并基于定量和定性指标评估其性能。

Result: 将模型应用于区域贸易协定文本以提取与贸易相关的信息三元组。

Conclusion: 强调了语言模型在经济应用中的重要性，并讨论了关键见解、挑战和潜在的未来方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object
triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The
findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of
economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement
texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to
extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the
zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive
and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the
unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key
insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the
significance of language models in economic applications.

### [5] [CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122)
*Jie Zhu,Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CARE的新框架，通过强化推理来增强情感支持对话（ESC），而无需依赖大规模合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在数据增强和合成语料库构建上，但往往忽略了有效情感支持背后的更深层次的认知推理过程。

Method: CARE框架利用原始ESC训练集来指导模型生成逻辑连贯和支持性的响应，从而显式地增强认知推理。此外，采用强化学习来改进和加强推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，CARE显著提高了响应的逻辑性和支持质量。

Conclusion: CARE框架能够推进移情、认知稳健和类人情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

### [6] [MADS: Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation for Diverse Persuasion Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05124)
*Mingjin Li,Yu Liu,Huayi Liu,Xiang Ye,Chao Jiang,Hongguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MADS: A multi-agent dialogue simulation framework for generating persuasive dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses industry challenges like lack of user data and cold-start evaluation in persuasive dialogue generation.

Method: Uses three coordinated agents: User Agents, a Dialog Agent, and an Optimization Agent to simulate and refine dialogues.

Result: Significantly improved persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4%.

Conclusion: MADS enables low-cost generation of training data and demonstrates clear business value in a real-world marketing scenario.

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

### [7] [Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125)
*Reza Shirkavand,Xiaokai Wei,Chen Wang,Zheng Hui,Heng Huang,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推荐系统方法，将协同过滤和大型语言模型结合起来，以提高推荐性能和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤和大型语言模型的优势，以满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释等日益增长的期望。

Method: 引入 Item-ID + Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE)，它将项目交互历史视为语言空间中的一种原生方言，使协同信号能够以与自然语言相同的方式被理解。通过将预训练 LLM 的每个块的前馈网络分成一个单独的文本专家和一个具有令牌类型门控的项目专家，该方法避免了文本和目录模式之间的破坏性干扰。

Result: IDIOMoE 在公共和专有数据集上都表现出强大的推荐性能，同时保留了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的方法，将协同过滤和大型语言模型结合起来，提高了推荐系统的性能和用户体验。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

### [8] [KEO: Knowledge Extraction on OMIn via Knowledge Graphs and RAG for Safety-Critical Aviation Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05524)
*Kuangshi Ai,Jonathan A. Karr Jr,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Chaoli Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KEO: A knowledge extraction and reasoning framework using LLMs for safety-critical contexts, improving global sensemaking via KG-augmented RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve knowledge extraction and reasoning in safety-critical contexts using LLMs and the OMIn dataset.

Method: Construction of a Knowledge Graph (KG) and integration into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.

Result: KEO improves global sensemaking, revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG is effective for fine-grained procedural tasks. Evaluated LLMs like Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3.

Conclusion: KG-augmented LLMs show promise for secure, domain-specific QA and high-stakes reasoning.

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

### [9] [Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05126)
*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)越来越多地用于决策，但当它们在没有发出低置信度信号的情况下给出答案时，用户可能会在不知情的情况下根据错误的输出采取行动。我们研究了有监督的微调是否可以提高模型传达不确定性的能力，以及这种改进是否能推广到不同的任务和领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在决策领域应用广泛，但其置信度表达常常不准确，导致用户可能依据错误信息做出决策。

Method: 通过在通用知识、数学和开放式问答数据集上微调LLM，并在单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较两个元认知任务上评估模型的泛化能力，包括医学和法律推理等未见领域。

Result: 微调可以提高校准（陈述的置信度与准确性之间的一致性）和区分度（正确答案比不正确答案具有更高的置信度），同时保持准确性不变。但是，改进是特定于任务的：单问题校准训练不会转移到成对比较，反之亦然。相比之下，对两种形式的元认知进行多任务微调会产生更广泛的收益，从而在领域外评估中产生更低的校准误差和更强的区分度。

Conclusion: LLM中的不确定性沟通是可训练和可推广的，不同的元认知技能不会自然地相互加强，必须通过多任务训练一起发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

*Si-Ioi Ng,Pranav S. Ambadi,Kimberly D. Mueller,Julie Liss,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于BERT的pipline，用于从Cookie Theft图片描述中自动提取和排序CIU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前用于通过图片描述自动评估认知语言障碍的方法通常忽略视觉叙事路径，而人工标注或基于字典的映射劳动强度大。

Method: 该方法使用二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，用于自动CIU提取和排序。

Result: 该方法在CIU检测中达到93%的中值精度和96%的中值召回率，序列错误率为24%。

Conclusion: 该pipeline可以有效地表征用于认知障碍评估的视觉叙事路径，并向公众开放源代码和模型。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

*Xinyu Guo,Zhengliang Shi,Minglai Yang,Mahdi Rahimi,Mihai Surdeanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种关系抽取框架CogRE，通过认知科学启发的推理和强化学习优化，提高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关系抽取缺乏对语言解释的监督，且单样本学习能力有限。

Method: CogRE框架包含一个基于认知科学的推理机制和一个基于强化学习的优化过程，使用LLM自动构建高质量的关键词词典。

Result: 在单样本RE任务中，CogRE在解释质量和任务准确性上均有提升，例如在One-shot NYT29数据集上，F1值达到24.65%，通过强化学习优化后提升了23.46%。

Conclusion: CogRE能够生成与黄金标签紧密相关的关系关键词，并将人类解释质量评级提高了54%。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

*Qingshu Xu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Ming Li,Nan Zhang,Sydney Peters,Yanbin Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大规模评估中项目与内容标准自动对齐的三种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模评估中，项目与内容标准的准确对齐对于有效的分数解释至关重要。

Method: 1) 提取嵌入并训练多个经典监督机器学习模型，研究降维对模型性能的影响；2) 微调了八个BERT模型及其变体，用于领域和技能对齐；3) 探索了集成学习，包括多数投票和堆叠多个元模型。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐上实现了最高的加权平均F1分数0.950，而RoBERTa-large在技能对齐上实现了最高的F1分数0.869。集成模型没有超过性能最佳的语言模型。降维增强了基于嵌入的线性分类器，但性能不如语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动项目与内容标准对齐的不同方法。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

### [13] [Submodular Context Partitioning and Compression for In-Context Learning-short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05130)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Canyu Zhang,Tianyi Zhou,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sub-CP improves in-context learning by intelligently selecting context blocks, addressing redundancy and under-representation issues for better performance across various tasks and model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic input complexity of transformers, which restricts the number of exemplars. Existing efficient ICL approaches often overlook information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition strategies, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The paper proposes Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that uses submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a range of selection strategies, allowing blocks to be globally diverse or locally coherent, enabling fine-grained control over semantic structure and precomputation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse tasks on multiple datasets demonstrate that Sub-CP consistently improves performance across model scales.

Conclusion: Sub-CP effectively addresses the limitations of existing ICL approaches by intelligently selecting context blocks, leading to improved performance in LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

*Bowen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合语义搜索系统，以帮助Head Start项目中的工作人员在GoEngage平台上找到合适的任务模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GoEngage平台存在领域术语、系统术语和词汇搜索的局限性，导致新员工难以找到合适的任务模块。

Method: 结合了轻量级的容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似性和约束的大型语言模型（LLM）重排序。

Result: 提供了一个全面的框架，详细说明了所需的资源、分阶段的实施策略、离线评估协议和在线测量方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过低假阳性率、适应术语变化的可演化性以及经济效率来确保可信度。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

### [15] [Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05132)
*Sheng Jia,Xiao Wang,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT) 的方法，用于解决大型语言模型在复杂问题中推理时，多样性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在鼓励多样性时，多样性和准确性之间存在trade-off。

Method: 将并行推理视为一个 set-of-next-token-prediction 问题，并使用 self-supervised bipartite matching 将基于集合的全局损失纳入 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)。

Result: SSFT 在多个推理基准测试中始终优于 SFT。

Conclusion: SSFT 能够保留独特的推理模式，并产生 emergent global forking tokens。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的合成数据已成为现代NLP训练流程不可或缺的一部分，但对于合成数据比例如何影响不同规模的模型行为的系统性理解仍然有限。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同的任务中，评估了经过一到三次训练迭代后的模型，合成数据比例范围从0-50%。

Result: 模型在高达20%的合成数据下保持稳定性能，但超过30%后性能下降加速；较大的模型（6.9B-12B）比小的模型（410M-1.4B）对合成数据表现出更大的鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确性损失；任务特征很重要，在合成数据训练下，推理任务比检索任务退化得更快。

Conclusion: 该研究为从业者提供了基于模型规模和任务要求的合成数据预算的实践指导，并与包括Shumailov等人的模型崩溃研究在内的同期工作进行了详细比较。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的由好奇心驱动的LLM-as-a-judge方法，用于评估创意写作，该方法针对每个人的创意判断进行个性化设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）擅长评估数学推理和事实准确性等客观任务，但在面对评估创造力的细微、主观性质时，它们会犹豫不决。

Method: 我们使用Chakrabarty等人（2024）中引入的Torrance创造性思维测试（TTCW）基准，该基准具有由专家人类注释的故事，涵盖各种主观维度（如原创性），以测试我们的假设。

Result: 我们证明，我们的方法能够使各种规模的模型学习不同个体的细微创造性判断，通过在各种评估指标（如Pearson相关性、Cohen系数和F1值）上改进基线监督微调（SFT）方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在并非所有注释者都彼此同意的主观评估中尤其有用。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Conclusion: 当前的研究主要集中在英语数据和GPT模型家族生成的文本上，需要更广泛的跨语言和跨模型研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

Motivation: 当前的多跳深度搜索任务评估基准存在推理路径泄露和评估指标单一的问题，无法有效评估模型的自主推理能力。

Method: 提出了WebDetective基准，包含无提示的多跳问题、可控的维基百科沙箱和全面的评估框架，用于分离搜索充分性、知识利用率和拒绝行为。同时，开发了EvidenceLoop工作流程，通过验证循环和系统证据跟踪来改进搜索和合成能力。

Conclusion: WebDetective基准是一个用于开发真正自主推理系统的关键工具，可以指导具体的架构改进。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献综述方法难以兼顾可读性和准确性，且写作阶段的研究较少。

Method: LiRA采用多智能体协作的工作流程，模拟人工文献综述过程，包括内容大纲、子章节写作、编辑和审阅等环节。

Result: 在SciReviewGen和ScienceDirect数据集上的评估结果表明，LiRA在写作和引文质量方面优于现有基线模型，并与人工撰写的综述具有相似性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使没有特定领域的调整，基于智能体的LLM工作流程也能提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为NLD-LLM的NLP框架，用于评估语言模型生成代码描述的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在评估不同的语言模型生成准确和简洁的源代码描述的能力。

Method: 该框架整合了多种Transformer模型，并采用全面的提示设计策略，包括标准化格式、清晰的任务指导和NLD提示。此外，还应用了迭代改进过程来提高输出质量。

Result: 分析表明，提示工程对模型的有效性有显著影响，较小的模型在精心设计的提示的支持下通常表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 提示工程显著影响模型效果，小模型在好的提示下也能有竞争力。

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在预测人类阅读行为方面的能力下降，尽管它们在预测下一个词方面表现更好。这是因为LLM的预测能力超过了人类，导致它们预测的阅读难度低于人类实验中的观察结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型作为人类语言预测的认知模型的应用，并解决LLM在预测人类阅读行为方面能力下降的问题。

Method: 分析LLM的超人能力主要由两个因素驱动：与人类相比，LLM具有更强的长期记忆和短期记忆。

Result: 发现LLM的超人能力主要归因于其强大的长期和短期记忆。

Conclusion: 主张创建具有类人长期和短期记忆的模型，并概述了实现这一目标的一些可能方向。同时，认为目前可用的人类数据不足以衡量这方面的进展，并概述了可以解决这一差距的人类实验。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

*Xin Wang,Anshu Raj,Matthew Luebbe,Haiming Wen,Shuozhi Xu,Kun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型的多阶段信息提取流程，用于从实验报告的材料中提取成分、处理、微观结构和性能等47个特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的材料发现需要大规模的实验数据集，但大多数信息仍然存在于非结构化的文献中。现有的提取工作通常侧重于有限的特征集，并没有解决理解材料行为所必需的集成成分-处理-微观结构-性能关系，从而对构建全面的数据库提出了挑战。

Method: 该流程集成了迭代提取和溯源，以提高准确性和可靠性。

Result: 在特征级别（独立属性）和元组级别（相互依赖的特征）的评估产生了0.96左右的 F1 分数。与没有源跟踪的单次提取相比，我们的方法将微观结构类别的 F1 分数提高了 10.0%（特征级别）和 13.7%（元组级别），并将 100 篇关于含析出物的多主元素合金的文章中遗漏的材料从 49 个减少到 13 个（漏报率从 12.4% 降低到 3.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流程能够实现可扩展和高效的文献挖掘，生成具有高精度、最小遗漏和零假阳性的数据库。这些数据集为机器学习和材料信息学提供了值得信赖的输入，而模块化设计可推广到不同的材料类别，从而实现全面的材料信息提取。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The WMT21 CED dataset is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal freshness.

Method: Creation of SynCED-EnDe with 1,000 gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50, from diverse 2024-2025 sources, with explicit error subclasses, structured trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments.

Result: Substantial performance gains over WMT21 with XLM-R and related encoders.

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe is a community resource to advance safe MT deployment, especially in emerging contexts like wearable AI devices.

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地进行模型归因，并能够区分不同的模型以及同一模型的不同检查点或备份。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“时间顺序思考”的即时对话思考机制，旨在提高全双工 SDLMs 的响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在听取阶段通过重复预测沉默令牌使代理保持空闲状态，这与人类行为不同：我们通常在对话过程中进行轻量级思考，而不是保持心不在焉。受此启发，我们提出了时间顺序思考。

Method: 时间顺序思考是一种专为流式声学输入设计的范例转变，它具有严格的因果关系，代理在听取时以增量方式进行推理，仅从过去的音频更新内部假设，而没有前瞻性。推理在听取窗口期间摊销；一旦用户停止说话，代理就会停止思考并开始说话，而不会进一步延迟。

Result: 实验表明，通过客观指标和人工评估，时间顺序思考的有效性在响应质量上显示出持续的改进。

Conclusion: 时间顺序思考能够稳健地处理对话动态，并在全双工交互指标上获得有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型时，上下文示例的格式选择较少被研究，但实际上很重要。

Result: 分隔符的选择对模型性能有显著影响，甚至可以改变模型排名。指定分隔符和选择最佳分隔符可以提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型对分隔符的选择非常敏感，可以通过优化分隔符来提高模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM摘要生成方法可能无法充分代表少数群体观点，且存在偏差，而目前的评估方法依赖于与人类判断对齐较弱的LLM judges。

Method: 构建了DeliberationBank数据集，包含审议问题和人类标注的摘要判断数据。训练了一个名为DeliberationJudge的DeBERTa模型，用于评估摘要的代表性、信息性、中立性和政策认可度。

Result: DeliberationJudge比LLM judges更有效，并且与人类判断更一致。通过DeliberationJudge评估了18个LLM，发现它们在审议摘要中存在持续的弱点，尤其是在少数群体立场的代表性方面。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展且可靠的评估审议摘要的方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

*Maksym Zavhorodnii,Dmytro Dehtiarov,Anna Konovalenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动检测大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中产生的幻觉的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决大型语言模型生成幻觉的问题，提高模型可靠性。

Method: 通过提示工程系统地分类和控制重现各种幻觉类型，构建幻觉数据集，并使用嵌入模型将其映射到向量空间，然后使用无监督学习技术在降维表示中分析幻觉。

Result: 研究表明，幻觉中信息失真的严重程度与其与正确输出集群的空间差异之间存在一致的相关性。简单的分类算法可以可靠地区分幻觉和准确的响应。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个轻量级且有效的框架，可以提高模型的可靠性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

*Chenghao Yang,Lin Gui,Chenxiao Yang,Victor Veitch,Lizhu Zhang,Zhuokai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的探索策略EAD，用于提升大型语言模型(llm)的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的固定温度抽样难以平衡样本质量和训练稳定性。

Method: EAD的核心思想是在生成序列的早期token采用高温度抽样，后期采用低温度抽样，实现“开始探索，结束利用”的策略。

Result: EAD显著提高了样本效率，优于固定温度抽样。

Conclusion: 将探索与序列生成的自然动态对齐，为提升LLM推理能力提供了一条可靠的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为Camellia的基准，用于评估大型语言模型(LLM)在九种亚洲语言中以实体为中心的文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是先前工作表明LLM在阿拉伯语中通常偏袒西方相关的实体，引发了对文化公平性的担忧。由于缺乏多语言基准，目前尚不清楚这种偏见是否也出现在不同的非西方语言中。

Method: 该论文引入了Camellia基准，它包含19,530个手动注释的实体，这些实体与特定的亚洲或西方文化相关联，以及2,173个从社交媒体帖子中提取的实体自然出现的掩码上下文。使用Camellia，该论文评估了四个最新的多语言LLM家族在各种任务中的文化偏见，例如文化背景适应、情感关联和实体抽取式问答。

Result: 研究结果表明，LLM在所有亚洲语言的文化适应方面都存在困难，并且在具有不同文化相关数据访问权限的地区开发的模型之间的表现存在差异。此外，不同的LLM家族持有其独特的偏见，并且在文化与特定情感的关联方式上存在差异。最后，LLM在亚洲语言的语境理解方面存在困难，从而在实体提取中造成了文化之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 论文表明LLM在处理亚洲语言的文化偏见方面存在挑战，需要在文化适应、情感关联和语境理解方面进行改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

*Yining She,Daniel W. Peterson,Marianne Menglin Liu,Vikas Upadhyay,Mohammad Hossein Chaghazardi,Eunsuk Kang,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 外部LLM安全防护模型容易受到数据分布变化的影响，通过研究RAG发现，在上下文中插入良性文档会改变输入和输出判断，使其变得不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLM）系统的安全性已成为一个紧迫的问题。外部基于LLM的guardrail模型已经成为一种流行的解决方案，用于筛选不安全的输入和输出，但它们本身是经过微调或提示工程的LLM，容易受到数据分布变化的影响。

Method: 以检索增强生成（RAG）为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guards和2个GPT-oss模型，研究了基于LLM的guardrail对嵌入在上下文中的额外信息的鲁棒性。

Result: 将良性文档插入到guardrail上下文中，会改变大约11%的输入和8%的输出判断，使其变得不可靠。我们分别分析了增强上下文中每个组成部分的影响：检索到的文档、用户查询和LLM生成的响应。我们测试的两种缓解方法只带来了很小的改进。

Conclusion: 目前guardrail存在上下文鲁棒性差距，并鼓励训练和评估协议能够对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了WeatherArchive-Bench，一个用于评估历史天气档案中检索增强生成（RAG）系统的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决气候科学家理解社会对极端天气事件的反应，但由于历史档案规模庞大、质量参差不齐以及语言古老，难以将其转化为结构化知识的挑战。

Method: 构建了包含两个任务的WeatherArchive-Bench基准：WeatherArchive-Retrieval（评估系统定位历史相关段落的能力）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（评估大型语言模型（LLM）分类极端天气叙述中社会脆弱性和韧性指标的能力）。

Result: 实验表明，稠密检索器在历史术语上表现不佳，而LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了在复杂社会指标推理方面的关键限制，并为设计更强大的、以气候为中心的档案RAG系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经方法在作者身份验证方面准确率高，但缺乏直接的可解释性，并且大型语言模型（LLM）的预测无法得到忠实的解释。

Method: 使用残差相似度（RS）方法，该方法利用神经网络来预测相似度残差，即由可解释系统预测的相似度中的误差。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅可以与最先进的作者身份验证模型相媲美，而且可以展示最终预测的忠实度和可解释性的程度。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种在作者身份验证中提高性能并保持可解释性的有效方法。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

Motivation: Transformer模型在序列处理任务中占据主导地位，但其注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了其在长序列上的应用。

Method: 分析了包括亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构等方法。

Result: 从计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果和基本限制等方面 критически 评估了这些方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评估了纯注意力Transformer模型的主导地位是否可能受到挑战。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 即使检索完美，长输入也会降低大型语言模型 (LLM) 的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和提高 LLM 的检索性能。

Method: 在数学、问答和编码任务上对 5 个开源和闭源 LLM 进行了系统实验。

Result: 即使模型可以完美地检索所有相关信息，随着输入长度的增加，它们的性能仍然会大幅下降 (13.9%--85%)。

Conclusion: 输入的长度本身会损害 LLM 的性能，而与检索质量无关，也没有任何干扰。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的健康本体和心理健康资源主要以英语或西方文化为中心，缺乏对印度语言中患者压力表达的表示。

Method: 通过基于图的方法，该框架能够捕获文化嵌入的压力表达，跨语言对齐这些表达，并将它们与临床术语联系起来。

Result: 该方法旨在通过将 AI 系统建立在文化上有效的表示中，解决医疗保健沟通中的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够为多语言环境下的心理健康护理提供更具包容性和以患者为中心的 NLP 工具。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Motivation: ICU中的护理文档存在术语不一致、非正式风格和缺乏标准化的问题，尤其是在心力衰竭护理中。

Method: 使用来自MIMIC-III数据库的8,838份心力衰竭护理记录和21,210个偏好对，利用DPO方法调整Mistral-7B模型。

Result: DPO显著提高了文档质量，BLEU提高了84%，BERTScore提高了7.6%，专家评估在准确性、完整性、逻辑一致性、可读性和结构清晰度方面均有所提高。

Conclusion: DPO能够使轻量级临床语言模型与专家标准对齐，支持电子健康记录系统中保护隐私的AI辅助文档，从而减少管理负担并提高ICU患者的安全性。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal

in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在工程领域赋能自主Agent方面潜力巨大，但在结构工程中，尤其是在需要几何建模、复杂推理和领域知识的有限元建模任务中，其潜力尚未得到充分挖掘。

Method: 该系统将结构分析分解为子任务，每个子任务由一个专门的Agent管理，这些Agent由轻量级的Llama-3.3 70B Instruct模型驱动。

Result: 在20个基准问题上的实验评估表明，该系统在大多数情况下，经过10次重复试验，准确率超过80%，优于Gemini-2.5 Pro和ChatGPT-4o模型。

Conclusion: 该系统成功地利用LLM自动化了二维框架的有限元建模，并在准确率上优于其他模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自过滤蒸馏框架，用于专利分类，该框架将LLM生成的理由视为信任信号，而不是ground-truth监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地生成自然语言理由来增强可解释性，但这些理由通常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定的不一致。

Method: 该框架采用选择性蒸馏，并由三个无监督信任指标指导：(1) 自洽性，它衡量LLM生成的理由在多次生成中的稳定性；(2) 类蕴涵对齐，它评估与专利特定类定义的语义一致性；(3) LLM一致性评分，它验证理由-标签的合理性。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集（一个广泛使用的专利分类基准）上的实验表明，我们的方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏。

Conclusion: 在专利分析中，建立了一个利用推理感知信任指标的可靠范例。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为SimulatorArena的基准，用于评估LLM模拟用户在多轮对话中替代真实用户的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLM进行交互式应用评估主要依赖于昂贵、耗时且难以复现的人工评估。因此，研究者探索使用LLM模拟用户进行自动评估，但缺乏对这些模拟用户可靠性的评估标准。

Method: 论文构建了一个包含909个带注释的人-LLM对话的基准数据集SimulatorArena，涉及数学辅导和文档创建两项交互任务。该基准通过比较模拟用户行为与人类行为的匹配程度以及模拟用户对助手评分与人类判断的一致性来评估模拟器。

Result: 实验表明，以用户画像（包括背景和消息风格等特征）为条件的模拟器与人类判断非常吻合，在两项任务上均达到0.7的Spearman相关系数。

Conclusion: 论文证明了基于用户画像的模拟器可以作为人工评估的实用且可扩展的替代方案。使用最佳模拟器对18个助手（包括GPT-5、Claude 4.1 Opus和Gemini 2.5 Pro等最新的LLM）进行了基准测试。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在智能体路由时，忽略了QA任务中细粒度的上下文和关系结构。不同智能体和主干网络表现出互补的优势，并且更大的模型并不总是更优越，因此需要自适应路由机制。

Method: 将多智能体QA构建为知识图引导的路由问题，并使用异构图神经网络（GNN）来学习任务感知的智能体路由分布。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有模型在理解对话中讽刺等复杂社会现象方面的弱点，并找到解决方案。通过评估模型的多步反事实推理能力来探索社会推理分析作为心理理论的一个方面。

Method: 构建了SocialNLI数据集，该数据集包含手工挑选的对话记录，这些对话记录集中于讽刺等复杂的社会细微之处，并配以推论、相应的可能性分数和人工撰写的解释。

Result: 论文构建了首个社会对话推理数据集SocialNLI。

Conclusion: 论文通过社会推理分析评估了LLM和推理模型的心理理论能力，着重关注了模型理解讽刺等复杂社会现象的能力。

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TensorBLEU: A GPU-accelerated BLEU metric implementation for efficient in-training evaluation of large NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation tools are a computational bottleneck, especially for in-training metrics like per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement Learning.

Method: Developed a fully vectorized, memory-efficient BLEU metric in PyTorch that uses a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams.

Result: TensorBLEU achieves speedups of over 13x on NVIDIA T4 GPUs and over 40x on NVIDIA A100 GPUs compared to NLTK.

Conclusion: TensorBLEU significantly accelerates research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning by providing a fast and efficient evaluation tool and is open-sourced for development purposes.

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

*Cassie Huang,Stuti Mohan,Ziyi Yang,Stefanie Tellex,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在规划任务中被高估，因为现有基准测试缺乏细粒度约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准测试过于简单，可能高估LLM的规划能力，并导致下游任务的安全问题。

Method: 通过手动添加细粒度的自然语言约束来增强现有基准测试。

Result: 引入约束后，LLM的性能下降一半，并且对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性显著降低。

Conclusion: 现有LLM在处理包含复杂约束的规划任务时存在局限性。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Motivation: 为了解决在LinkedIn等求职平台上，将大型语言模型(LLM)应用于职位匹配任务时，因领域复杂、需要结构化输出以及模型过大导致的高延迟和可扩展性问题。

Method: 论文提出了LANTERN框架，该框架涉及多目标建模，包括用于分类的编码器模型和用于解释的解码器模型，并结合了多层次知识蒸馏，整合了数据和logits级别的见解。此外，论文还分享了关于后训练技术和提示工程的见解。

Conclusion: LANTERN框架有效地解决了在职位匹配任务中应用大型语言模型的挑战，并在实际应用中取得了显著的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

*Ceyhun Efe Kayan,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Prototype-Based Dynamic Steering (PDS) 的新方法，用于增强大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理能力，无需额外指令或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型仍然依赖于明确的推理指令或静态的、一刀切的指导方法，缺乏自适应的、无指令的推理增强方法。

Method: 通过聚类 CoT 和中性提示之间的激活差异来引入“推理原型”。在推理时，将输入的隐藏状态投影到这些原型上，形成一个特定于实例的 steering 向量。

Result: 在 GSM8K、AQuA-RAT 和 BIG-Bench 任务上的评估表明，PDS 能够持续提高准确率，而无需进行微调或提示工程。即使在 CoT 被显式抑制以提高成本效率时，增益仍然存在。

Conclusion: 动态的、原型引导的 steering 方法是一种轻量级的替代方案，可以替代训练时方法来增强 LLM 的推理能力。

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Jean Piaget的建构主义理论的自主阅读agent的记忆模块CAM，它具有结构化图式、灵活的同化和动态的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在理解长篇文档时面临着巨大的信息量挑战，需要一个有凝聚力的记忆模块。

Method: 我们从Jean Piaget的建构主义理论中获得灵感，构建了一个具有结构化图式、灵活的同化和动态的适应性的自主阅读agent的记忆模块CAM，并采用增量重叠聚类算法进行结构化记忆开发。

Result: CAM在各种长文本阅读理解任务（包括问答、基于查询的摘要和声明验证）中，在性能和效率方面均表现出优于现有方法的双重优势。

Conclusion: CAM为基于LLM的阅读理解提供了一个更强大和高效的记忆系统。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为E-FPN的框架，用于小样本语义分割，以解决基础设施检测应用中标记数据稀缺的问题。该框架在小样本情况下表现出色，并在基础设施检测数据集上取得了很好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习框架需要大量的标记数据集，并且无法用少量数据学习新的缺陷类别，这在基础设施检测应用中是一个问题。

Method: 该方法使用原型学习框架，包括自适应E-FPN编码器、带掩码平均池的原型学习以及基于注意力的特征表示。

Result: 在基础设施检测数据集上的实验表明，该方法在小样本情况下表现出色，最佳配置在2-way分类测试中达到82.55%的F1分数和72.26%的mIoU。自注意力方法带来了最显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了基础设施检测系统中快速响应新缺陷类型的关键需求，并能以有限的新训练数据来实现更高效和经济的维护计划。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，该技术优先考虑皮肤区域以提高提取信号的质量，从而增强了远程光电容积脉搏波（rPPG）技术在各种现实场景中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高rPPG技术的准确性，特别是在光照和运动敏感的情况下，本文旨在通过改进皮肤区域选择来增强信号质量。

Method: 提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，该技术可以检测身体各处的皮肤区域，同时去除可能引起干扰的区域，例如嘴巴、眼睛和头发。

Result: 该模型在公开数据集上进行了评估，并提出了一个新的数据集SYNC-rPPG。结果表明，该模型在诸如说话和头部旋转等具有挑战性的条件下具有捕获心跳的先验能力，并保持预测心率和实际心率之间的平均绝对误差（MAE）。

Conclusion: 该技术在检测各种肤色方面表现出很高的准确性，使其成为实际应用的有希望的选择。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的自动显微镜系统，该系统使用 DeepAf 框架进行单次聚焦预测，旨在降低数字病理的成本并提高可及性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 WSI 扫描仪成本高昂，其他低成本解决方案存在局限性，例如自动显微镜难以保持一致的对焦，传统的自动对焦方法耗时，现有的深度学习方法需要多张输入图像或缺乏跨组织类型和染色方案的泛化能力。

Method: 该系统采用 DeepAf 框架，该框架通过混合架构独特地结合了空间和光谱特征，用于单次聚焦预测。该网络自动回归到最佳焦点距离，并调整控制参数以获得最佳图像结果。

Result: 该系统与基于堆栈的方法相比，聚焦时间减少了 80%，在同实验室样本上实现了 0.18 μm 的聚焦精度，与双图像方法 (0.19 μm) 的性能相匹配，但输入需求减半。DeepAf 表现出强大的跨实验室泛化能力，仅有 0.72% 的错误聚焦预测，90% 的预测在景深范围内。对 536 个脑组织样本的临床研究表明，该系统在 4 倍放大倍率下实现了 0.90 AUC 的癌症分类，这在低于典型 20 倍 WSI 扫描的放大倍率下是一项重大成就。

Conclusion: 该研究成果是一种全面的硬件-软件设计，可在资源受限的环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成样本时，结构不一致，出现幻觉。这些幻觉可归因于数据分布模式之间的过度平滑。但是，语义插值通常是需要的，并且可以导致生成多样性，因此需要一种更细致的解决方案。

Method: 引入动态引导，通过选择性地锐化已知导致伪影的方向上的得分函数，同时保留有效的语义变化，来缓解幻觉。

Result: 在受控和自然图像数据集上，动态引导大大减少了幻觉，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出了一种在生成时解决幻觉的方法，而不是通过事后过滤。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

Motivation: 基于扩散模型的视频生成中，潜在变量的冗余为加速提供了切入点。现有的基于缓存的加速方法在推理的后两个阶段会导致大量的内存激增。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码阶段，并针对不同阶段的特点提出了阶段性的策略来减少内存消耗：1) 异步缓存交换；2) 特征块；3) 切片潜在变量进行解码。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降保持在可接受的范围内。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的训练后加速扩散模型视频生成的方法，可以在降低内存消耗的同时提高推理速度。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种时间反演重建框架，该框架使用配对的RGB和热图像来恢复几秒钟前的场景状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从当前的观察中恢复过去是一个有趣的挑战，在法医学和场景分析中具有潜在的应用。热成像技术可以提供其他不可见的信息，人类通常比周围环境更温暖，互动会留下残留的热痕。这些消退的痕迹可以作为被动的时间代码，从而可以推断出超出RGB相机功能的最新事件。

Method: 该方法将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程相结合，其中一个视觉语言模型生成场景描述，另一个视觉语言模型指导图像重建，从而确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 该方法在三个受控场景中进行了评估，证明了重建高达120秒前的合理过去帧的可行性。

Conclusion: 为从热痕迹进行时间反演成像迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Result: 使用可训练的映射网络（pi-map）以及冻结的 CLIP 文本和图像编码器，在两个旨在评估个性化检索的基准测试中，提高了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在个性化检索任务上取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [58] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead提出了一种新框架，用于创建支持连续LOD控制的3D高斯头部化身，无需重新训练即可实现高效且连续的LOD控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3DGS的化身通常依赖于数万个3D高斯点，并且高斯点的数量在训练后是固定的。但是，许多实际应用都需要可调节的细节级别（LOD）以平衡渲染效率和视觉质量。

Method: 该方法在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯函数，并提出由多层可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，以编码其潜在特征。然后，一个轻量级的基于神经网络的解码器将这些潜在特征转换为用于渲染的3D高斯属性。ArchitectHead通过在所需分辨率下动态重新采样UV特征场中的特征图来控制高斯函数的数量。

Result: 实验结果表明，ArchitectHead在最高LOD的自身和交叉身份重演任务中实现了最先进的（SOTA）质量，同时在较低LOD下保持了接近SOTA的性能。在最低LOD下，我们的方法仅使用6.2％的高斯函数，而质量适度下降（L1 Loss +7.9％，PSNR --0.97％，SSIM --0.6％，LPIPS Loss +24.1％），并且渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead 实现了在不同LOD下高质量和高效率的 3D 头像渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

Motivation: 利用日益普及的深度传感器和激光雷达设备提供的密集3D数据，为动作识别开辟第三条道路。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的人体行为识别方法，特别是在利用深度传感器和单目深度估计的场景下，具有较高的准确率和竞争力。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黎曼度量，用于扩散模型的噪声空间，以解决现有插值方法在数据流形上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型缺乏一个显式的、可处理的低维潜在空间，这限制了流形感知分析和操作，例如插值和编辑。现有的插值方法通常在高密度区域中寻找路径，这不一定与数据流形对齐，并且可能产生感知上不自然的过渡。

Method: 在噪声空间中提出了一种新的黎曼度量，该度量受到最近发现的 score function 的 Jacobian 捕获局部数据流形的切线空间的启发。该度量鼓励噪声空间中的测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形内。

Result: 在图像插值实验中表明，提出的度量比现有的基于密度的方法和朴素基线产生感知上更自然和真实的过渡。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼度量能够更好地利用扩散模型学习到的数据流形，从而实现更自然的插值效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Teamwork 的灵活高效的统一解决方案，用于联合增加输入和输出通道的数量，以及将预训练的扩散模型适应于新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通道扩展解决方案通常是特定于应用程序的，并且这些解决方案难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务。

Method: 通过协调和调整基本扩散模型的多个实例（即队友）来实现通道扩展，而无需改变预训练的扩散模型架构。我们采用了一种新颖的低秩自适应（LoRA）变体，以共同解决不同队友之间的适应和协调问题。此外，Teamwork 支持队友的动态（停）激活。

Result: 在各种生成和逆图形任务（如修复、单图像 SVBRDF 估计、本征分解、神经阴影和本征图像合成）上证明了 Teamwork 的灵活性和效率。

Conclusion: Teamwork 是一种灵活高效的统一解决方案，用于联合增加输入和输出通道的数量，以及将预训练的扩散模型适应于新任务。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在批改、分析和反馈手写学生作业方面的潜力，特别是在中小学数学教育中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写作业能提供学生学习过程的宝贵见解，但批改非常耗时。因此，研究MLLM在手写数学作业上的表现。

Method: 通过两个实验评估MLLM在手写学生数学作业上的表现：实验A评估加纳中学生的算术题，实验B评估美国小学生的数学图示。

Result: 实验A中，MLLM接近人类准确率（95%，k=0.90），但偶尔会犯人类教育者不太可能犯的错误。实验B中，直接分析学生图示时，模型表现不佳（k=0.20），但获得详细的人工描述后，一致性水平显著提高（k=0.47）。

Conclusion: MLLM在理解算术运算方面表现较好，但在理解学生数学图示方面仍有困难。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要集中于为识别或运动获取丰富的表示，而不是两者兼顾。潜在动态建模已被用于决策，以学习观察的潜在表示及其随时间的转换为控制和规划任务。

Method: Midway Network利用中间自上而下的路径来推断视频帧之间的运动潜在因素，以及密集的前向预测目标和分层结构来处理自然视频的复杂多对象场景。

Result: 在两个大型自然视频数据集上进行预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法取得了强大的性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network学习的动态可以通过一种基于前向特征扰动的新颖分析方法来捕获高级对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法通常在几何完整性、对象交互性、物理合理性、照片级真实感渲染或可靠的动态模拟等一个或多个关键方面存在不足。

Method: HoloScene利用全面的交互式场景图表示，对对象几何体、外观和物理属性以及分层和对象间的关系进行编码。重建被表述为一个基于能量的优化问题，将观测数据、物理约束和生成先验集成到一个统一的、连贯的目标中。通过结合基于采样的探索和基于梯度的细化的混合方法，可以有效地执行优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上进行的评估表明，HoloScene具有优越的性能，而在交互式游戏和实时数字孪生操作中的实际用例说明了HoloScene的广泛适用性和有效性。

Conclusion: HoloScene是一个新颖的交互式3D重建框架，它生成的数字孪生体表现出完整而精确的几何形状、物理稳定性和来自新视角的逼真渲染。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP is a training-free method that calibrates the suppressive effect of dominant tokens in VLMs for text-driven image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer structural limitations where a few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics, dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the discriminative features.

Method: The method includes a Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE) in the visual space, which decouples visual features into target and low information regions, identifies dominant tokens, and dynamically suppresses their representations. It also includes a Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC) in the textual space, which differentiates between general and discriminative concepts within the text query.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: CalibCLIP is effective in improving text-driven image retrieval by calibrating the suppressive effect of dominant tokens.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了增强对齐和细节，新的图像生成方法采用chain-of-thought (CoT) 推理，将用户输入扩展为详细的提示，但这种策略会引入不必要的冗余，增加计算成本，并可能引入与原始提示相矛盾的细节，即视觉过度思考。

Method: 引入ShortCoTI，一个轻量级优化框架，通过自适应函数奖励更简洁的提示，该函数根据每个任务的估计难度进行缩放。将此奖励纳入强化学习范例中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，提示推理长度减少了54%，同时保持或略微提高了质量指标。定性分析表明，该方法消除了冗长的解释和重复的改进，产生了简洁且语义丰富的推理提示。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI提高了计算效率，且不影响生成图像的保真度或视觉吸引力。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Motivation: 现有HOID方法高度依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）的先验知识来增强交互识别能力，但将VLM知识连接到目标检测器中的HOI实例表示的训练策略和模型架构具有挑战性，并且整个框架复杂，不利于进一步开发或应用。同时，MLLM在人与物体交互检测方面的固有推理能力尚未得到充分探索。

Conclusion: 本文首次探索了语言模型在HOID任务中的潜力，无需任何额外的检测模块。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on point sets, hindering the capture of long-range dependencies and global structural properties.

Method: A coarse-to-fine generative framework (PointNSP) that uses a next-scale prediction paradigm to preserve global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refine fine-grained geometry at higher scales.

Result: PointNSP achieves state-of-the-art generation quality within the autoregressive paradigm on ShapeNet, surpassing strong diffusion-based baselines in efficiency. Demonstrates strong scalability potential in dense generation.

Conclusion: PointNSP establishes SOTA generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm.

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个开源框架，旨在简化地理空间基础模型（GFM）的开发和部署，通过整合自动化数据管理、模型提炼和无缝部署，将研究级的GFM转化为实用的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GFM的部署受限于缺乏自动化地理空间数据管道和微调模型体积过大。现有GFM缺乏处理原始卫星图像的工作流程，下游适配通常保留了原始编码器的完整复杂性。

Method: InstaGeo整合了自动化数据管理，将原始图像转换为模型就绪数据集；任务特定的模型提炼，以获得紧凑、计算高效的模型；以及作为交互式Web地图应用程序的无缝部署。

Result: 使用InstaGeo，我们复现了三个已发布研究的数据集，并且训练的模型在洪水mapping、作物分割和沙漠蝗虫预测方面的mIoU差异很小。提炼后的模型比标准微调模型小8倍，减少了FLOPs和CO2排放，且精度损失最小。利用InstaGeo简化的数据管道，我们还管理了一个更大的作物分割数据集，实现了60.65%的最先进的mIoU，比之前的基线提高了12 pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo统一了数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级GFM转化为实用的低碳工具，用于实时、大规模的地球观测。这种方法将地理空间AI转向数据质量和应用驱动的创新。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model
checkpoints are available at:

*Sara Mandelli,Diego Vila-Portela,David Vázquez-Padín,Paolo Bestagini,Fernando Pérez-González*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度学习图像鉴别器是否依赖于频域伪影来检测AI生成的图像。通过去除图像的频谱峰值并分析其对检测器的影响，发现大多数检测器并非根本依赖于频谱峰值。本文提出了一个简单的线性检测器，该检测器仅依赖于频率峰值，为法医工具的透明性和可靠性铺平了道路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对于图像鉴别器是否真正依赖于频域伪影（特别是幅度谱中的周期性峰值）来检测AI生成的图像仍然不清楚，这限制了解释性和信任度。

Method: 提出了一种从图像中去除频谱峰值的策略，并分析了此操作对多个检测器的影响。此外，还引入了一个简单的线性检测器，该检测器仅依赖于频率峰值。

Result: 发现大多数检测器并非根本依赖于频谱峰值，这挑战了该领域中一个广泛的假设。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，目前的图像鉴别器可能并不像之前认为的那样依赖于频域伪影，未来的研究方向应该是开发更透明和可靠的法医工具。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

*Shozo Saeki,Minoru Kawahara,Hirohisa Aman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的用于深度度量学习的损失函数，名为组合双曲和欧几里得软三元组（CHEST）损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲空间可以表示更丰富的结构，例如树结构，因此对于深度度量学习很有吸引力。然而，由于在双曲空间中应用基于代理的损失存在一些问题，因此尚未见报道。基于代理的损失对于大型数据集很有吸引力，因为它们的训练复杂度较低。

Method: 该方法结合了双曲空间和欧几里得空间中基于代理的损失，以及基于双曲分层聚类的正则化损失。

Result: 双曲空间和欧几里得空间的结合提高了 DML 准确性和两个空间的学习稳定性。在四个基准数据集上评估 CHEST 损失，实现了新的最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CHEST 损失是一种有效的方法，可以提高深度度量学习的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于诊断眼源性异常头位(AHP)的深度学习框架，该框架可以自动诊断并从缺失数据中恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位(AHP)是一种由眼球不正引起的代偿机制。早期诊断可以最大限度地减少发病率和继发性并发症，但目前的临床评估在很大程度上仍然是主观的，并且由于不完整的医疗记录而变得更加复杂。

Method: 本文通过两个互补的深度学习框架来解决这两个挑战。首先，AHP-CADNet是一个多层次的注意力融合框架，用于自动诊断，它集成了眼部地标、头部姿势特征和结构化临床属性，以生成可解释的预测。其次，一个基于课程学习的插补框架旨在通过逐步利用结构化变量和非结构化临床笔记来缓解缺失数据，以增强实际数据条件下的诊断鲁棒性。

Result: 在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上的评估表明了强大的诊断性能。AHP-CADNet在分类任务中实现了96.9-99.0%的准确率，连续变量的预测误差较低，MAE范围为0.103-0.199，R2超过0.93。插补框架在所有临床变量上保持了较高的准确率(使用PubMedBERT时为93.46-99.78%)，临床依赖性建模产生了显著的改进(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 这些发现证实了这两个框架在临床环境中自动诊断和从缺失数据中恢复的有效性。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EduVerse是一个多智能体模拟空间，旨在重现虚拟课堂中的认知发展、群体互动和长期演变，并支持环境、智能体和会话定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中在短期或单智能体的设置，限制了对课堂复杂性和跨任务重用的系统研究。

Method: EduVerse建立在分层CIE（认知-互动-进化）架构上，确保了认知、情感和行为上的个体一致性、真实的互动和纵向适应。

Result: 在三个文本类型、环境和多个会话的中国中学课堂中验证了EduVerse。结果表明：（1）教学一致性：模拟的IRF率与真实课堂非常匹配，表明了教学的真实性；（2）群体互动和角色分化：网络密度适中，人机任务表明个体差异和教学稳定性之间存在平衡；（3）跨会话演变：积极的过渡率R+平均增加11.7%，捕捉了行为、情感和认知的纵向变化，揭示了结构化的学习轨迹。

Conclusion: EduVerse平衡了现实性、可重复性和可解释性，为教育人工智能提供了一个可扩展的平台。该系统将开源，以促进跨学科研究。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于脚本的视频摘要方法主要考虑视频的视觉内容，忽略了视频的语音内容与脚本的相关性。

Method: 该方法使用加权跨模态注意力机制，对脚本-视频和脚本-转录之间的依赖关系进行建模，从而显式地利用配对模态之间的语义相似性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在基于脚本和通用视频摘要任务上都具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SD-MVSum方法和扩展数据集已在https://github.com/IDT-ITI/SD-MVSum上发布。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ARGUS的方法，用于肝癌组织学亚型分类，该方法通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观分层信息来提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用肝癌组织学亚型分类中Whole Slide Images (WSIs) 的层级结构、肿瘤微环境 (TME) 和几何表示等重要特征，导致对组织学表示的理解不足和亚型分类性能欠佳。

Method: 该方法首先构建微观几何特征以表示细胞层面的精细模式，然后设计分层视野对齐模块以建模WSIs中固有的宏观和中观层级交互，最后通过几何先验引导的融合策略将增强的微观几何和视野特征融合为联合表示，以建模整体表型交互。

Result: 在公共和私人队列上的大量实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学亚型分类中实现了最先进的 (SOTA) 性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为临床实践中原发性肝脏恶性肿瘤提供了一种有效的诊断工具。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物插入和背景融合视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的联系，并且依赖训练来实现高性能。

Method: 利用预训练的text-to-image扩散模型，结合反演技术和无分类器指导，并提出mask-guided self-attention机制。

Result: 实现了affordance-aware的全局编辑，无缝地将人物插入到场景中，并且保证了个性化的高质量，从单个参考图像中保留了主体的身份、服装和身体特征。

Conclusion: 首次以无训练的方式执行逼真的人物插入场景，并在具有出色身份保留的各种复合场景图像中实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域中仍未被充分探索，特别是与人们对视频生成和场景理解日益增长的兴趣相比。本文解决了编辑古典音乐会的多机位录像这一难题。

Method: 该方法将问题分解为两个关键子任务：何时剪切和如何剪切。在最新的文献基础上，我们提出了一种新颖的多模态架构，用于时间分割任务（何时剪切），该架构集成了来自音频信号的log-mel频谱图，以及可选的图像嵌入和标量时间特征，通过一个轻量级的卷积-transformer流水线。对于空间选择任务（如何剪切），我们通过使用基于clip的编码器从旧的backbone（例如ResNet）进行更新，并将干扰物选择限制为来自同一音乐会的片段，从而改进了文献。

Result: 我们的模型在检测剪切点方面优于先前的基线，并提供了有竞争力的视觉镜头选择，从而提高了多模态自动视频编辑的最新水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的多模态架构，用于自动编辑古典音乐会多机位录像，并在检测剪切点和视觉镜头选择方面取得了优于现有技术水平的结果。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Motivation: 评估病原体R. solani对种子萌发动态和生长的影响。

Method: 开发了一种新的图像分析流程，该算法集成了形态和空间特征，以识别和量化单个幼苗，并进行时间整合。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了发芽率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在幼苗计数和活力评估方面表现出很高的准确性， determination系数为0.98，均方根误差 (RMSE) 为 1.12。

Conclusion: 验证了将低成本成像硬件与先进的计算工具相结合以非破坏性和可扩展的方式获得表型数据的可行性。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉模型在推理和上下文学习方面不如语言模型，可能是因为缺乏语义和上下文引导。

Method: 该方法通过将“对象”建模为“单词”的视觉等价物，并使用掩码图像建模 (MIM) 框架在视觉对象上应用掩码，从而学习全局上下文和语义。

Result: 实验结果表明，对象级别的表示有助于学习真实世界的分布，并且在视觉问题回答 (VQA) 任务中表现出强大的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级别的编码是有效的，并为开发更强大的视觉编码器和分词器提供了一个可行的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型研究难以在保持身份的同时准确控制年龄，并且微调此类模型通常需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 该论文利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和年龄特定LoRA融合策略，该策略利用矩阵融合技术SVDMix。

Result: AgeBooth可以从单个参考图像生成不同年龄的逼真且身份一致的面部图像。实验表明，与以前最先进的基于编辑的方法相比，AgeBooth实现了卓越的年龄控制和视觉质量。

Conclusion: AgeBooth 是一种有效的年龄控制方法，可以在不需要大量年龄标签数据的情况下，生成高质量的中间年龄肖像。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

*Amirtaha Amanzadi,Zahra Dehghanian,Hamid Beigy,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的合成图像检测方法FusionDetect和一个新的基准OmniGen，旨在提高检测器在跨生成器和跨视觉领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成图像检测方法在跨视觉领域泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出FusionDetect，利用CLIP和Dinov2两个预训练模型提取特征，构建一个能适应生成器内容和设计的特征空间。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准和OmniGen上都取得了新的state-of-the-art结果，并且对图像扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个高性能的检测器，一个新的基准和一个促进通用AI图像检测的框架。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

### [85] [ALISE: Annotation-Free LiDAR Instance Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05752)
*Yongxuan Lyu,Guangfeng Jiang,Hongsi Liu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ALISE的新框架，用于在没有任何注释的情况下执行LiDAR实例分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室外LiDAR点云的手动注释成本高且耗时。目前的方法试图减少这种负担，但仍然依赖于某种形式的人工标注。为了完全消除这种依赖性。

Method: 该方法首先利用视觉基础模型（VFM），在文本和图像的指导下，生成初始伪标签。然后，通过一个专用的时空投票模块来细化这些标签，该模块结合了2D和3D语义，用于离线和在线优化。为了实现卓越的特征学习，进一步引入了两种形式的语义监督：一组基于2D先验的损失，将视觉知识注入到3D网络中，以及一种新的基于原型的对比损失，通过利用3D语义一致性来构建区分性特征空间。

Result: 该方法取得了显著的性能提升，为无监督3D实例分割建立了新的技术水平。值得注意的是，该方法甚至优于MWSIS，MWSIS是一种在来自地面真实（GT）2D边界框的监督下运行的方法，在mAP中提高了2.53%（50.95% vs. 48.42%）。

Conclusion: ALISE框架在无监督3D实例分割方面表现出色，无需人工标注，并且优于一些有监督的方法。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

*Zexin Zheng,Huangyu Dai,Lingtao Mao,Xinyu Sun,Zihan Liang,Ben Chen,Yuqing Ding,Chenyi Lei,Wenwu Ou,Han Li,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OneVision的端到端生成框架，以解决传统视觉搜索中的多阶段级联架构(MCA)问题，该框架通过视觉对齐的残差量化编码(VRQ)对齐不同视点的对象表示，并采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持视觉相似性的同时整合用户个性化偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多阶段级联架构(MCA)，但在跨阶段存在同一对象的多视角表示差异和优化目标冲突，难以在用户体验和转化率上达到帕累托最优。

Method: 构建于视觉对齐残差量化编码(VRQ)之上，对齐不同视角的表示，同时保留每个产品的独特特征。采用多阶段语义对齐方案，保持视觉相似性的先验性，并有效整合用户特定信息以进行个性化偏好生成。

Result: 离线评估与在线MCA相当，并通过动态剪枝提高了21%的推理效率。A/B测试显示，物品点击率(CTR)提高2.15%，转化率(CVR)提高2.27%，订单量提高3.12%。

Conclusion: 语义ID中心化的生成架构可以统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练策略，该策略结合了少量但可靠的数据集和单个或多个弱标记数据源，以生成多源标记数据集，并考虑了每个来源的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络需要大量的训练样本才能获得良好的泛化能力，并且对训练标签中的错误敏感。遥感中获得高度可靠的标签成本很高且数量有限。

Method: 利用描述每个来源错误统计信息的转移矩阵。转移矩阵嵌入到标签中，并在训练过程中用于根据相关来源对每个标签进行加权。该方法在梯度水平上充当加权方案，其中每个实例以不同的权重贡献于不同类别的优化。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验验证了所提出方法的有效性。结果证明了该方法的鲁棒性和利用不可靠标签来源的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地利用不可靠的标签来源，提高深度学习模型在遥感图像场景分类中的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的 OOD 检测方法，该方法利用预训练模型的中间层表示，并通过熵准则自动选择信息量最大的层，从而提高 OOD 检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数 OOD 检测方法都将大型预训练模型视为整体编码器，仅依赖于其最后一层表示进行检测，这可能忽略了中间层中包含的丰富信息。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于熵的准则，用于自动识别提供最互补信息的层，无需访问 OOD 数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，与最先进的无训练方法相比，本文方法在远 OOD 基准测试中将 OOD 检测的准确性提高了 10%，在近 OOD 基准测试中提高了 7%。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果揭示了 OOD 检测研究的新途径，并揭示了各种训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的 OOD 检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于栅格化的优化策略，结合了栅格化高斯核渲染的效率和Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知门控机制，加速二维图像回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts回归框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 用栅格化公式代替全局迭代优化，实现更快的参数更新和更节省内存的模型表示。

Result: 该方法支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用，这些应用是标准栅格化高斯核方法无法直接实现的。在计算效率和重建保真度之间取得了新的平衡。

Conclusion: 将快速栅格化优化与Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知结构相结合，为二维图像处理任务在计算效率和重建保真度之间提供了新的平衡。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督深度学习方法，用于检测电影 CMR 中的关键帧，以实现心脏动力学的时序对齐分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动方法仅从左心室容量曲线中获取 ES 和 ED 帧，无法提供对心肌运动的更深入了解。为了解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法从图像中导出密集的可变形配准场，并使用它们来计算一维运动描述符。然后，使用一组简单的规则从这些特征曲线中确定关键帧。

Result: 该方法在 SAX 的 ED 和 ES 的检测精度提高了 30% - 51%，在 4CH 中提高了 11% - 47%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够检测 ED 和 ES，以及整个心动周期中的三个附加关键帧，SAX 的平均 cFD 低于 1.31 帧，LAX 的平均 cFD 低于 1.73 帧。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent: 使用光流先验减少长视频理解中的冗余，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型处理长视频时受限于上下文长度和视频内容冗余。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，通过时序粒度优化（TGO）和运动token剪枝（MTP）在时序和空间层面减少冗余。TGO利用光流先验对帧进行分层，过滤不相关信息；MTP使用光流信息剪枝帧内冗余token。

Result: 在Video-MME（64.7%），MLVU（71.4%）和LongVideoBench（60.4%）等多个视频MLLM基准测试中优于现有方法，尤其是在小时级视频理解任务上。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过结合光流先验，有效提升了MLLM在长视频理解任务中的性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological research, but it is challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets.

Method: The model uses neural architecture search (NAS) for images and combines image embeddings with metadata. An alternating bi-level optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture parameters.

Result: BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81% accuracy on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset and 93.25% accuracy on the Insects-1M dataset.

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming.

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable

Result: 在包含7个主流视觉AR模型的ARForensics数据集上进行的实验表明，D^3QE具有优异的检测精度和在不同AR模型上的强大泛化能力，并且对真实世界的扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D^3QE方法在自回归生成图像检测方面表现出色，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Result: 在三个保留的基准上评估了所提出的 WS-ICL 模型。实验结果表明，WS-ICL 在显著降低注释成本的情况下，实现了与常规 ICL 模型相当的性能。此外，即使在交互式范例下，WS-ICL 也具有很强的竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL 是朝着更高效和统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于物流环境中缺陷检测的大规模数据集，该数据集比现有数据集大得多，且物体姿态和外观更多样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常检测工作主要集中在制造业场景，这些场景具有高度控制的姿态和有限的对象类别。现有的基准测试已经饱和，而零售物流中的异常检测面临新的挑战，尤其是在对象姿态和外观的多样性和可变性方面。

Method: 引入了一个新的基准，包含超过23万张图像（以及超过29,000个缺陷实例），包含超过48,000个不同的对象。

Result: 对多种最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛的评估，结果表明它们在数据集上的 AUROC 不超过 56.96%。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的基准，并鼓励未来研究解决零售物流异常检测中这个具有挑战性的问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对 MetaFormer 架构中的 token mixers 在医学图像上的应用进行了全面的研究，比较了 pooling、卷积和注意力机制等不同的 token mixers 在图像分类和语义分割任务上的性能，并探讨了自然图像预训练权重迁移的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer 架构通过替换自注意力机制简化了 Transformer 结构，并在自然图像上取得了成功。然而，其在医学图像上的应用较少，且缺乏对不同 token mixers 的比较。

Method: 本文在 MetaFormer 架构中系统地分析了基于 pooling、卷积和注意力机制的 token mixers，并在八个涵盖不同模态和常见挑战的医学图像数据集上进行了图像分类和语义分割实验。同时，研究了将自然图像预训练权重迁移到新的 token mixers 上的效果。

Result: 对于分类任务，低复杂度的 token mixers（如分组卷积或 pooling）已经足够，且预训练权重仍然有效。对于分割任务，卷积 token mixers 的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积是更好的选择。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面研究了 token mixers 在医学图像上的应用，为医学图像领域的 MetaFormer 架构设计提供了指导。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对基于大型语言模型（LLM）的安全关键代理的设计进行了信息理论分析，强调了规则编码在系统提示中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的安全关键代理的设计需要比简单的提示工程更多的东西。

Method: 通过对因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化和交叉注意机制等多种注意架构的正式分析，建立了指针保真度的界限，并展示了锚点放置策略必须如何考虑竞争的保真度和熵目标。

Result: 低句法熵和高度集中的锚点的规则格式降低了注意熵，提高了指针保真度，但揭示了锚点冗余和注意熵之间的根本权衡。

Conclusion: 原则性锚点设计和双重执行机制对于保护基于LLM的代理免受提示注入攻击同时在不断发展的领域中保持合规性是必要的。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM自主代理架构，称为结构化认知循环（SCL），它将推理、记忆和控制分离，以提高连贯性和可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的框架通常在一个提示中将推理、记忆和控制交织在一起，这会降低连贯性和可预测性。

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专门用于推理，记忆在外部维护，并通过目标导向循环中的轻量级控制器来指导执行。

Result: 在三个场景（基于温度的旅行计划、带有条件发送的电子邮件起草和约束引导的图像生成）的评估中，SCL在360个episode中显示出适度但一致的改进。任务成功率平均为86.3%，而基线为70-77%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，架构分离可以提高可靠性和可追溯性，而无需依赖更大的模型或更重的提示。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAC-Opt: Backward-guided correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics rather than solver feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches typically remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically flawed models.

Method: SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a semantically faithful model.

Result: SAC-Opt improves average modeling accuracy by 7.8%, with gains of up to 21.9% on the ComplexLP dataset.

Conclusion: Semantic-anchored correction in LLM-based optimization workflows is important to ensure faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT)，用于处理复杂规则系统，通过模仿人类专家的推理过程，将推理过程分为定性分析、证据收集和裁决三个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，因为它们通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化的文本数据，导致推理发散，忽略了准确解释所需的关键规则依赖性。

Method: 提出了动态裁决模板（DAT），该模板将推理机制构建为三个有条理的阶段：定性分析、证据收集和裁决。在定性分析阶段，模型全面评估上下文环境。随后的证据收集阶段涉及根据预定义的模板元素有针对性地提取相关信息，然后根据适用规则进行系统验证。最后，在裁决阶段，模型综合这些经过验证的组件以形成全面的判断。

Result: 经验结果表明，在复杂的基于规则的任务中，DAT 始终优于传统的 CoT 方法。值得注意的是，DAT 使较小的语言模型能够达到甚至超过显着更大的 LLM 的性能，突显了其在管理复杂规则系统方面的效率和有效性。

Conclusion: DAT 框架通过其结构化的推理方法，提高了语言模型在复杂规则系统中的性能，并且能够让更小的模型达到甚至超过更大模型的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过在算法信息理论 (AIT) 中重新构建符号接地问题 (SGP)，为该问题提供了一个明确的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证了意义的接地是一个根本上受信息论限制的过程，从而统一了哥德尔（自我参照）和没有免费午餐（统计）的观点。

Method: 将符号系统建模为通用图灵机，并将接地定义为信息压缩的行为。证明分四个阶段进行。

Result: 证明了纯粹的符号系统无法接地几乎所有可能的“世界”（数据字符串），因为它们是算法随机的，因此是不可压缩的；任何静态接地的系统，专门用于压缩特定世界，本质上是不完整的，因为相对于该系统，总是可以构建一个对抗性的、不可压缩的世界；适应新世界的“接地行为”被证明是不可推断的，因为它需要输入无法从系统现有代码中推导出的新信息（更短的程序）；任何算法学习过程本身都是一个有限的系统，无法理解或建模其复杂性可证明超过自身的世界。

Conclusion: 这确定了意义是一个系统不断试图克服自身信息论局限性的开放式过程。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个LLM驱动的多智能体系统，它可以直接从自然语言任务描述中构建可训练的PINN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建可用的PINN仍然是劳动密集且容易出错的。现有的基于LLM的方法通常假设已经指定了正式的PDE，因此缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补的代理：PDE代理，PINN代理，代码代理和反馈代理。

Result: Lang-PINN实现了实质上更低的误差和更大的鲁棒性：均方误差（MSE）降低了高达3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高了50％以上，并且减少了高达74％的时间开销。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN可以将非正式的任务语句转换为可执行和可验证的PINN代码。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Method: 综述了代表性的基础模型和关键的可衡量对齐的指标，并综合了来自视觉、语言、语音、多模态和神经科学研究的经验证据。

Result: 基础模型通常在表征空间中表现出结构规律性和语义一致性，使其成为跨模态迁移和对齐的有力候选。

Conclusion: 分析了促进表征潜力的关键因素，讨论了未解决的问题，并强调了潜在的挑战。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reliably query structured knowledge in the legal domain without sacrificing its deterministic properties.

Method: Introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal query execution layer centered on canonical actions, enabling high-precision hybrid search, robust reference resolution, point-in-time version retrieval, and auditable causal tracing. Uses planner-guided agents to decompose complex queries into DAGs of these actions.

Result: Transforms retrieval into a transparent, auditable process.

Conclusion: Directly addresses Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: 该框架集成了不确定性推理方法和语义互操作性技术，是推动物联网应用（尤其是在农业领域）的宝贵工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分而治之思想的层级多LLM代理方法Dramaturge，用于改进长篇叙事脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM在生成高质量长篇叙事时存在困难，因为它们难以全面理解上下文，无法识别全局结构问题和局部细节缺陷，并且难以协调多个粒度和位置的修改。

Method: Dramaturge包含全局审查阶段、场景级审查阶段和层级协调修订阶段。通过自顶向下的任务流程和粗到细的迭代过程，确保高层策略指导局部修改，保持上下文一致性。

Result: 实验表明，Dramaturge在剧本整体质量和场景细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dramaturge是一种即插即用的方法，可以轻松集成到现有方法中，以改进生成的脚本。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

Motivation: 传统分析方法难以处理大量半结构化数据，人工评估效率低下，标准NLP管道需要大量特定任务的标注数据且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了一种新的图推理框架，将大型语言模型与结构化人口统计属性和非结构化公众反馈相结合，动态地将不断变化的公民需求建模为需求感知图，从而能够基于年龄、性别和多重剥夺指数等关键特征进行特定人群的分析。

Result: 使用真实世界数据集进行测试，初步实验结果表明该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境中智能人口健康监测提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and

offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in

TL;DR: 重复采样能显著提高前沿AI系统的能力和风险，但如何用有限的样本预测大规模尝试下的模型行为是一个关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿AI系统的能力和风险，以及解决如何用有限的采样预算预测大规模尝试下的模型行为。

Method: 1. 发现拟合这些规律的标准方法存在统计缺陷，尤其是在数据有限的情况下。2. 引入了一个稳健的估计框架，使用beta-binomial分布从有限的数据中生成更准确的预测。3. 提出了一种动态抽样策略，将更多的预算分配给更困难的问题。

Result: 这些创新能够以一小部分的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见的风险和能力。

Conclusion: 结合这些创新，我们能够以较小的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合奖励建模框架，用于对齐多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）与人类偏好，该框架结合了基于模型的奖励和基于规则的奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM与人类偏好对齐方法依赖于单一信号、基于模型的奖励方法，这些方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，无法捕捉人类偏好的各个方面，并且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 提出一种混合奖励建模框架，整合互补的奖励范式：(i) 基于模型的奖励，其中学习的奖励模型从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数，以及 (ii) 基于规则的奖励，其中特定领域的启发式方法提供具有置信度的显式正确性信号。此外，还结合多方面奖励以加强指令遵循，并引入广义长度惩罚奖励以稳定训练并提高性能。

Result: 实验表明，在应用混合和多方面奖励建模时，不同的多模态基准测试均取得了持续的改进。在3B系列中，性能最佳的模型在通用和数学推理任务中的总体平均改进约为9.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLM提供了一种灵活有效的方法，尤其在数学推理和问题解决方面表现出色，平均改进约为16%。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: 介绍了BIRD-INTERACT，一个更真实的用于多轮text-to-SQL任务的benchmark，它包含一个全面的交互环境，并且涵盖了完整的CRUD操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮text-to-SQL benchmarks不足以反映生产级别的数据库助手挑战，因为它们将对话历史视为静态上下文，或者限制评估为只读操作。

Method: 构建了一个包含分层知识库、元数据文件和功能驱动的用户模拟器的综合交互环境，并设计了两种评估设置：预定义的对话协议（c-Interact）和开放式的agentic设置（a-Interact）。

Result: GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中仅完成17.00%的任务，验证了BIRD-INTERACT的难度。

Conclusion: 有效的交互对于复杂、动态的text-to-SQL任务至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在有限训练数据下，将基础模型应用于新领域的问题。当前的研究表明，使用领域特定的范例作为上下文演示是有效的。但是，本文研究了仅将范例表示为文本是否是最有效、稳定和高效的方法。因此，作者提出了一种名为多头注意力检索增强生成（MHA-RAG）的框架，该框架使用注意力头的数量作为一个简单的超参数来控制不同任务中的软提示生成。实验结果表明，在多个问答基准和模型规模上，MHA-RAG 比标准 RAG 提高了 20 个百分点，同时将推理成本降低了 10 倍 GFLOP，从而在不考虑范例顺序的情况下，实现了更高的准确性和更高的效率。

Motivation: 在有限的训练数据下，将基础模型适应到新的领域是具有挑战性的，并且计算成本很高。

Method: 提出了一种名为多头注意力检索增强生成 (MHA-RAG) 的框架，该框架具有注意力头的数量，可作为一个简单的超参数来控制跨不同任务的软提示生成。

Result: 在多个问答基准和模型规模上，MHA-RAG 比标准 RAG 提高了 20 个百分点。

Conclusion: MHA-RAG在不考虑范例顺序的情况下，实现了更高的准确性和更高的效率, 同时推理成本降低了 10 倍 GFLOP。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现有意义的人机协作，需要更深入地理解符号及其社会构建的含义。人工智能系统经常 মিস 在对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动理论，进行了两项研究。

Result: 研究结果提供了关于人类和会话人工智能代理在互动过程中如何协同塑造意义的经验性见解。参与者会根据会话人工智能代理提出的符号和解释来改变他们最初的意义定义，尤其是在引入社会背景时。参与者还将个人和社 会价值投射到这些互动中，随着时间的推移改进含义。

Conclusion: 共享理解并非源于简单的同意，而是源于符号的双向交流和重新解释，这为 人机交互设计提出了新的范例。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用Teacher-Student学习框架来预测热处理后钢材最终硬度的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于热处理过程的多对一性质，不同的输入参数组合可能导致相同的硬度值，因此从期望的硬度值估计输入参数的逆问题非常困难。

Method: 该方法首先训练一个前向模型（Teacher）来预测最终硬度，然后训练一个后向模型（Student）从目标硬度值推断合理的输入配置。Student通过利用Teacher的反馈在一个迭代的监督循环中进行优化。

Result: 在公开的回火钢数据集上评估该方法，并与基线回归和强化学习模型进行比较。结果表明，Teacher-Student框架不仅实现了更高的逆预测精度，而且所需的计算时间更少。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了Teacher-Student框架在材料科学中逆过程建模的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM的成功是否反映了真正的推理或复杂的记忆。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交的高质量论文中提取问题陈述，并使用专门的求解器代理通过迭代评论循环提出和改进技术解决方案。

Result: LLM可以重新发现可行的解决方案，偶尔会提出创造性的替代方案，但其解决问题的能力仍然脆弱且对框架非常敏感。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为自主科学问题解决者，但其能力既有潜在的，也有局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合神经符号框架，将答案集编程（ASP）与基于transformer的学习相结合，应用于航空安全报告系统（ASRS）语料库，以解决深度transformer模型在多标签文本分类中违反领域逻辑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现出色，但常常违反专家认为必不可少的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤其令人担忧。

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，并使用Clingo求解器进行验证。这些规则以两种互补的方式结合：（i）作为基于规则的数据增强，生成逻辑上一致的合成样本，以提高标签多样性和覆盖率；（ii）作为模糊逻辑正则化器，在微调期间以可微形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强大的二元交叉熵（BCE）基线相比，该方法提高了micro-和macro-F1分数，并在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违反减少。

Conclusion: 该研究是第一个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动的增强和可微transformer训练相结合的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Method: 分析模型在多种编程语言中的置信度和性能。

Result: AI模型表现出与人类相似的过度自信模式，尤其是在不熟悉或低资源领域。能力较差的模型和在稀有编程语言中运行的模型表现出更强的DKE样偏差，表明偏差的强度与模型的能力成正比。

Conclusion: AI模型可能存在与人类相似的认知偏差，尤其是在不熟悉的领域。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注模型是否拒绝回答或违反预定义的安全规则，而无法揭示模型在面对真实的争议性问题时是否坚持一致的价值观体系。

Method: VAL-Bench包含来自维基百科争议章节的11.5万个问题对，通过评估模型在面对框架相反的问题时是否表达相似的观点来判断其价值观是否一致。使用LLM-as-judge来评估配对回答之间的一致性或差异。

Result: 在主流的开源和闭源模型上的应用表明，模型在价值观对齐方面存在很大差异，并且揭示了安全策略（例如，拒绝回答）和更具表现力的价值观体系之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准测试，可以系统地比较LLM可靠地体现人类价值观的程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖于编码通用编程知识的基础模型，缺乏高质量的、与漏洞相关的推理数据，并且在LLM训练期间难以验证中间漏洞修复过程。

Method: 未提及

Result: 现有方法表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 现有方法面临挑战：缺乏高质量、与漏洞相关的推理数据；难以验证LLM训练期间的中间漏洞修复过程。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

TL;DR: MetaVLA: A unified post-training framework for VLA models that improves generalization and reduces training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models struggle to generalize to new tasks and often require task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Context-Aware Meta Co-Training leverages diverse auxiliary tasks and a meta-learning mechanism for rapid adaptation.

Result: MetaVLA outperforms OpenVLA on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher accuracy, fewer training steps, and reduced GPU time.

Conclusion: Scalable post-training can lead to general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning

TL;DR: AgentFlow，一个可训练的agentic框架，通过在多轮交互循环中直接优化其规划器来协调四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的语言模型方法在长horizon和多样化工具下扩展性差，并且泛化能力弱。Agentic系统通过分解跨专业模块的工作提供了一个有希望的替代方案，但大多数仍然是免训练的或依赖于与多轮交互的实时动态分离的离线训练。

Method: 提出了Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO)，通过将多轮优化转换为一系列易于处理的单轮策略更新来解决长horizon、稀疏奖励信用分配问题。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，AgentFlow的平均准确率在搜索方面提高了14.9%，在agentic方面提高了14.0%，在数学方面提高了14.5%，在科学任务方面提高了4.1%，甚至超过了像GPT-4o这样更大的专有模型。

Conclusion: 分析证实了in-the-flow优化的好处，表明规划得到改善，工具调用可靠性增强，并且随着模型大小和推理轮数的增加而呈正比例增长。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前无线系统中的静态AI模型无法持续适应和改进，因此本文旨在研究自进化agentic AI在未来无线系统中的应用。

Method: 本文提出了一个多智能体协作的自进化agentic AI框架，其中多个大型语言模型在监督智能体的协调下被分配角色专业提示，并通过结构化对话、迭代反馈和系统验证来自主执行整个生命周期。

Result: 在低空无线网络（LAWNs）中的天线进化案例研究表明，该框架能够自主地将固定天线优化升级为可移动天线优化，并且实验结果表明，所提出的自进化agentic AI能够自主提高波束增益并恢复高达52.02%的性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文验证了自进化agentic AI在下一代无线智能方面的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

Conclusion: GPT-4o 能够以高精度从放射学报告中提取标签，以训练有竞争力的多标签分类模型。放射学报告中检测到的不确定性不会影响这些模型的性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

TL;DR: D2E框架利用桌面环境作为机器人具身智能任务的有效预训练基底，通过统一的OWA工具包、通用IDM和VAPT，实现了从可扩展的桌面数据收集到具身领域验证迁移的完整流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有具身AI受限于物理轨迹收集的高昂成本。桌面环境（尤其是游戏）提供了一种引人注目的替代方案，它们可以在保持具身学习所需的结构化观察-动作耦合的同时，提供大规模的丰富传感器运动交互。

Method: 该框架包含三个组件：OWA工具包（将不同的桌面交互统一为标准化格式并进行152倍压缩），Generalist-IDM（通过基于时间戳的事件预测，在未见过的游戏中实现强大的零样本泛化，从而实现互联网规模的伪标记）和VAPT（将桌面预训练的表示迁移到物理操作和导航）。

Result: 使用1300多小时的数据（259小时的人工演示和1000多小时的伪标记游戏），在LIBERO操作上实现了96.6％的成功率，在CANVAS导航基准上实现了83.3％的成功率。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感器运动原语表现出足够的不变性，可以有意义地迁移到物理具身任务，从而确立了桌面预训练作为一种实用的机器人技术范例。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Motivation: 在海啸等灾后监测场景中，无人机数据收集面临调度和速度控制的挑战，传统深度强化学习方法存在训练复杂和不符合实时性要求的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的上下文学习方法（AIC-VDS），用于无人机速度控制和数据收集调度，该方法考虑了地面传感器的电池电量、队列长度、信道条件以及无人机的轨迹。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的AIC-VDS方法优于深度Q网络（DQN）和最大信道增益基线。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力，可以有效地解决灾后无人机数据收集中的调度和速度控制问题，并优于传统的深度强化学习方法。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Motivation: Data scarcity and difficulty deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments hinder industrial fault diagnosis.

Method: A three-tiered mechanism: Visual-Semantic Synergy, Content-Aware Reasoning, and Cloud-Edge Synergy with knowledge distillation.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge model achieves comparable performance with 83% model size reduction and 50% latency reduction.

Conclusion: Syn-Diag offers a practical, robust, and deployable paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the
current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics.

Motivation: 现有自动MAS设计技术表现不佳，且计算成本高，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM)，通过在代码空间中进行树搜索来发现，并使用执行轨迹的反思来改进。

Result: 该方法显著优于手动设计的MAS和现有自动MAS设计方法，且具有出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM作为一种通用的推理构建块，可以在不同的基础模型和任务域中保持高性能，无需进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Method: 使用图神经网络模拟拉格朗日粒子扩散模型（LPDM），构建集合管道来估计大气传输“足迹”、温室气体摩尔分数测量及其不确定性。

Result: 该模拟器比NAME LPDM快约1000倍，并能重现大规模足迹结构。集合计算揭示了预测误差的空间相关性，并突出了大气传输足迹和甲烷摩尔分数的低置信度时空预测。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于其他大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，并提高卫星监测的稳健性。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Result: XGBoost 模型在短短 30 分钟内实现了 PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了一个清晰的“证据转变”，其中特征的重要性随着 meme 获得关注而从静态上下文动态地转变为时间动态。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的基准，用于在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下进行早期传播性预测，贡献了一个新颖的跨语言数据集和一个方法论上合理的传播性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Motivation: 现有的知识图补全和消息传递GNN方法在药物和疾病无先验关联时性能不佳。

Method: 构建一个多智能体系统，通过对抗性辩论动态构建证据图，并利用自进化循环分析推理策略，提炼成可转移的启发式方法。

Result: 在适应症AUPRC指标上，RareAgent比现有推理基线提高了18.1%。

Conclusion: RareAgent提供了一个透明的推理链，与临床证据一致，能有效解决罕见病药物重定向问题。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

### [137] [Towards Label-Free Biological Reasoning Synthetic Dataset Creation via Uncertainty Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05871)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Lawrence Phillips,Aditya Misra,Tom A. Lamb,Philip Torr,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur,Kaspar Märtens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标签的合成思维链 (CoT) 轨迹过滤方法，用于训练大型推理模型 (LRM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于ground-truth标签来生成或过滤CoT轨迹，这在生物学等领域成本高昂。

Method: 利用模型自身的置信度（通过不确定性指标如自我一致性和预测困惑度量化）来过滤CoT轨迹，保留低不确定性的子集。

Result: 在生物扰动预测任务上，使用不确定性过滤的数据进行监督微调 (SFT) 优于使用未过滤的合成数据，缩小了与ground-truth训练的差距，并超越了强大的 LRM 基线。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是有效推理数据集创建的强大信号，使 LRM 能够在监督成本高昂的领域中应用。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

### [138] [Optimizing for Persuasion Improves LLM Generalization: Evidence from Quality-Diversity Evolution of Debate Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05909)
*Aksel Joonas Reedi,Corentin Léger,Julien Pourcel,Loris Gaven,Perrine Charriau,Guillaume Pourcel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DebateQD的最小质量-多样性(QD)进化算法，该算法通过锦标赛式的比赛来演化不同类别(理性、权威、情感诉求等)的辩论策略，其中两个llm进行辩论，而第三个llm进行判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)优化为输出真实答案通常会过度拟合，产生无法推广的脆弱推理。虽然基于说服的优化在辩论环境中显示出了希望，但它尚未与主流的基于真相的方法进行系统地比较。

Method: 引入DebateQD，这是一种最小的质量-多样性(QD)进化算法，它通过锦标赛式的竞争来进化不同类别(理性、权威、情感诉求等)的辩论策略，其中两个llm进行辩论，而第三个llm进行判断。不像以前提出的需要llm群体的方法，我们的方法通过在单个LLM架构中基于提示的策略来保持对手的多样性，使其更易于实验，同时保留了基于群体的优化的关键优势。与之前的工作相比，我们通过固定辩论协议并仅交换适应度函数来明确地分离优化目标的角色:说服奖励说服法官的策略，而不管真相如何，而真相奖励协作的正确性。

Result: 在来自QuALITY基准的三个模型尺度(7B、32B、72B参数)和多个数据集大小中，说服优化策略实现了高达13.94%的更小的train-test泛化差距，同时匹配或超过了真值优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 这些结果提供了第一个受控的证据，证明了说服的竞争压力，而不是协作地寻求真理，培养了更具可转移性的推理技能，为提高LLM的泛化能力提供了一条有希望的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETA:免训练的时间序列分类框架，通过多Agent和上下文推理，利用LLM进行通道级分类和融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间序列分类（TSC）中，标记数据稀缺，任务特定训练成本高且不灵活。最近的LLM在理解时间模式方面显示出希望，但纯粹的zero-shot用法仍然不是最优的。

Method: FETA将多元序列分解为通道子问题，检索每个通道的结构相似的标记示例，并利用LLM将查询与这些示例进行比较，生成具有自信度的通道级标签；然后，置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在九个具有挑战性的UEA数据集上，FETA在完全免训练的设置下实现了强大的准确性，超过了多个经过训练的基线。

Conclusion: 多Agent上下文推理框架可以将LLM转换为有竞争力的即插即用TSC求解器，而无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态、反事实的基准测试方法MatheMagic，用于揭示过拟合和测量真正的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学基准测试容易过拟合，并且模型可能会记住测试集。

Method: 通过改变数字和运算符的解释来生成数学测试实例，这些实例具有自动验证的答案。

Result: 模型更容易解决演绎问题而不是归纳问题，但它们会恢复到标准数学。在归纳任务上进行微调的模型的泛化能力较差。

Conclusion: 数学自适应模型未能表现出一般的推理“技能”，并且在归纳任务上的微调泛化能力较差。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的赋权研究较少关注将其作为预训练信号，而本文旨在探索赋权在提高下游任务数据效率方面的潜力。

Method: 本文扩展了传统的赋权概念，引入了折扣赋权，并提出了一种新的预训练范式，该范式通过最大化折扣赋权来初始化策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于赋权的预训练可以作为一种通用的初始化策略，提高智能体在下游任务中的适应性。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果为未来将该框架扩展到高维复杂任务，进一步推动强化学习领域的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

TL;DR: 提出了ARISE，一种用于评估大型推理模型测试时缩放能力的新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，如何系统地比较和评估不同模型的测试时缩放能力成为关键问题。

Method: 提出了ARISE，它包含两个关键创新：(1) 样本级别感知，有效惩罚负缩放行为；(2) 动态抽样机制，减轻准确率波动和token计数不稳定性对最终评估的影响。

Result: 通过在数学推理、代码生成和Agent任务等不同领域评估最先进的推理模型，证明了ARISE能够可靠且细粒度地测量测试时缩放能力，揭示了不同模型在缩放效率上的显著差异。评估结果表明，Claude Opus相比其他模型表现出更优越的缩放特性。

Conclusion: ARISE提供了一种可靠和细粒度的测试时缩放能力评估方法，可以有效区分不同模型的性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型(LRM)在推理过程中识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出生成前的最后几个token中，拒绝分数急剧下降。通过因果干预分析，发现少量注意力头负面影响拒绝行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多步推理能力的大型推理模型(LRM)中，安全对齐失败的原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪token位置上的拒绝意图，并进行因果干预分析。

Result: 发现“拒绝悬崖”现象，即模型在推理过程中识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出生成前的最后几个token中，拒绝分数急剧下降。消融3%的注意力头可以将攻击成功率降低到10%以下。Cliff-as-a-Judge方法使用1.7%的原始安全训练数据实现了相当的安全改进。

Conclusion: 许多推理模型并非本质上不安全，而是它们的拒绝意图受到了系统性的抑制。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

TL;DR: MixReasoning通过动态调整推理深度来优化推理过程，对难题进行详细推理，对简单问题进行简明推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型对所有步骤都进行扩展推理，存在冗余，因为子问题的难度和复杂性差异很大。

Method: MixReasoning框架动态调整单个响应中推理的深度。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，并在不影响准确性的前提下大大提高了效率。

Conclusion: MixReasoning 是一种有效的优化推理过程的方法。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepEvolve集成了深度研究和算法演化，以迭代循环的方式改进和测试新假设，从而在多个科学基准测试中持续改进初始算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型助手要么依赖算法演化，要么依赖孤立的深度研究，但都存在局限性。算法演化依赖LLM的内部知识，在复杂领域迅速达到瓶颈；深度研究提出未经验证的想法，导致不切实际的解决方案。

Method: DeepEvolve结合了外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，形成一个反馈驱动的迭代循环。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等九个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，生成可执行的新算法并取得持续收益。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve弥合了无引导演化和无基础研究之间的差距，为推进科学算法发现提供了一个可靠的框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于预测SQL查询的运行时长，该框架使用从PostgreSQL提取的执行计划特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成本模型依赖于静态启发式方法，通常无法反映复杂和不断变化的工作负载下的实际查询性能。

Method: 该方法集成了执行计划中的标量和结构特征以及SQL查询的语义表示，以训练预测模型。构建了一个自动化管道，用于使用参数化的TPC-H查询进行数据收集和特征提取。

Result: XGBoost模型显著优于其他模型，均方误差为0.3002，在超过65%的情况下，预测精度在真实运行时的10%以内。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了基于树的学习与执行计划特征相结合，在改进查询优化器中的成本估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate query runtime prediction is a critical component of effective query
optimization in modern database systems. Traditional cost models, such as those
used in PostgreSQL, rely on static heuristics that often fail to reflect actual
query performance under complex and evolving workloads. This remains an active
area of research, with recent work exploring machine learning techniques to
replace or augment traditional cost estimators. In this paper, we present a
machine learning-based framework for predicting SQL query runtimes using
execution plan features extracted from PostgreSQL. Our approach integrates
scalar and structural features from execution plans and semantic
representations of SQL queries to train predictive models. We construct an
automated pipeline for data collection and feature extraction using
parameterized TPC-H queries, enabling systematic evaluation of multiple
modeling techniques. Unlike prior efforts that focus either on cardinality
estimation or on synthetic cost metrics, we model the actual runtimes using
fine-grained plan statistics and query embeddings derived from execution
traces, to improve the model accuracy. We compare baseline regressors, a
refined XGBoost model, and a sequential LSTM-based model to assess their
effectiveness in runtime prediction. Our dataset includes over 1000 queries
generated from TPC-H query templates executed in PostgreSQL with EXPLAIN
ANALYZE. Experimental results show that the XGBoost model significantly
outperforms others, achieving a mean squared error of 0.3002 and prediction
accuracy within 10% of the true runtime in over 65% of cases. The findings
highlight the potential of tree-based learning combined with execution plan
features for improving cost estimation in query optimizers.

Motivation: 提高SQL中相关子查询的处理效率。

Method: 分离谓词的非相关部分，并重写查询。

Result: 在适当的条件下，该技术可以实现5倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该技术在特定条件下可以显著提高查询效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a novel technique for processing correlated
subqueries in SQL. The core idea is to isolate the non-correlated part of the
predicate and use it to reduce the number of evaluations of the correlated
part. We begin by providing an overview of several classes of queries that may
benefit from this technique. For each class, we propose a potential rewrite and
discuss the conditions under which it is advantageous. Next, we address the
evaluation aspects of the proposed rewrites: 1) we describe our approach to
adapting the block-based Volcano query processing model, and 2) we discuss the
benefits of implementing that technique within a position-enabled column-store
with late materialization support. Finally, we present a simple cost model that
allows estimation of the benefits of said rewrites.
  Our evaluation has a quantitative part and a qualitative part. The former
focuses on studying the impact of non-correlated predicate selectivity on our
technique. The latter identifies the limitations of our approach by comparing
it with alternative approaches available in existing systems. Overall,
experiments conducted using PosDB (a position-enabled column-store) and
PostgreSQL demonstrated that, under suitable conditions, our technique can
achieve a 5x improvement.

*Nilesh Gupta,Chong You,Srinadh Bhojanapalli,Sanjiv Kumar,Inderjit Dhillon,Felix Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为BlockRank的新方法，用于解决In-context Ranking (ICR) 中的效率问题。BlockRank通过利用LLM attention中的结构稀疏性和query-document block相关性，实现了线性复杂度的attention操作，并在性能上与现有方法相媲美，同时显著提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICR方法在处理大量候选文档时面临效率挑战，因为attention操作的复杂度会随着上下文长度的增加而呈平方或超线性增长。

Method: 该论文首先观察到LLM attention中的两种结构：文档间的块稀疏性和query-document block相关性。然后，提出了BlockRank方法，该方法通过在架构上强制执行块稀疏性来降低attention复杂度，并通过对比训练目标优化query-document block相关性。

Result: 在BEIR, MSMarco和NQ数据集上，使用Mistral-7B模型进行的实验表明，BlockRank在匹配或超过现有最佳listwise排序器的同时，显著提高了推理效率（在包含100个MSMarco文档的上下文中提高了4.7倍），并且可以优雅地扩展到长上下文的候选列表（在1秒内处理大约500个文档）。

Conclusion: BlockRank为ICR提供了一个可扩展且有效的解决方案，它通过利用LLM attention中的结构，实现了效率和性能的提升。

Abstract: In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval
(IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly
incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the
model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s).
While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm,
especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of
attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first
identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs
finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within
each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and
(2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query
tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that
document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce
BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the
attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed
inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to
linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block
relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary
contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments
on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches
or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned
baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100
MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context
shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length)
within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.

Abstract: In the digital era, the exponential growth of scientific publications has
made it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently identify and
access relevant work. This paper presents an automated framework for research
article classification and recommendation that leverages Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Using a large-scale arXiv.org

Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and
k-Nearest Neighbour). Our experiments show that Logistic Regression with
TF--IDF consistently yields the best classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 69\%. To complement classification, we incorporate a recommendation
module based on the cosine similarity of vectorized articles, enabling
efficient retrieval of related research papers. The proposed system directly
addresses the challenge of information overload in digital libraries and
demonstrates a scalable, data-driven solution to support literature discovery.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM-agent框架AgenDR，它将LLM推理与可扩展的推荐工具联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有agent-based推荐框架难以解决幻觉物品和全目录排序的问题，并且未能充分利用LLM的常识推理来捕捉用户意图。

Method: 利用LLM来整合多个推荐输出，并基于用户历史推断替代和补充关系。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了卓越的完整排名性能，平均比其底层工具提高了两倍。

Conclusion: 该框架减轻了幻觉问题，可扩展到大型目录，并通过关系推理增强了推荐相关性。

Abstract: Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors
by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle
with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a
largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning
to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between
items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional
ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent
framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation
tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while
utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on
personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement
relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination,
scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through
relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery
datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking
performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying
tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly
measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.

TL;DR: 对话式推荐系统(CRS)的评估方法依赖于可靠的评估方法。然而，这些系统的互动性给自动评估带来了巨大的挑战。本文 критически 检查了当前的评估实践，并确定了两个关键的局限性：过度依赖静态测试集合和现有评估指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话式推荐系统(CRS)的评估方法至关重要，但交互性给自动评估带来了巨大的挑战。现有评估实践过度依赖静态测试集合，且现有评估指标不足。

Method: 分析了与9个现有CRS的真实用户互动，并展示了自我报告的用户满意度与先前文献中报告的性能分数之间的显著脱节。探索了用户模拟生成动态交互数据的潜力，并提出了基于通用奖励/成本框架的新型评估指标。

Result: 对不同模拟方法的分析提供了对其有效性的有价值的见解，并显示出与人工评估相比，系统排名具有更高的相关性的有希望的初步结果。

Conclusion: 在CRS评估方面迈出了重要一步，同时也确定了未来在模拟技术和评估指标方面需要进一步研究和改进的领域。

Abstract: Research and development on conversational recommender systems (CRSs)
critically depends on sound and reliable evaluation methodologies. However, the
interactive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic
evaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and
identifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections
and the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this
critique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and
demonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and
performance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations,
this work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic
interaction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we
propose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework,
designed to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different
simulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and
reveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system
rankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a
significant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future
research and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻推荐系统以用户参与度为优先，但研究者认为应支持媒体在民主社会中的角色，基于编辑价值（特别是多样性）进行推荐。规范理论与技术设计之间存在差距。

Method: 1. 确定数据集必须包含的信息，以支持开发符合规范文献的多样性感知新闻推荐系统。2. 评估当前公开数据集的局限性，并展示其在扩展多样性感知推荐系统研究方面的潜力。3. 分析欧洲法律和政策如何为研究人员提供结构性数据访问，以开发多样性感知新闻推荐系统。

Result: 分析了现有数据集的局限性与潜力，并探讨了欧洲法律和政策在数据获取方面的作用。

Conclusion: 为了在实践中实现多样性感知推荐系统，关注训练现代新闻推荐器所需的数据集至关重要。

Abstract: News recommender systems increasingly determine what news individuals see
online. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued
recommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an
alternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support
the media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending
news based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there
continues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender
systems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs
such systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in
practice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to
train modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First,
we identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of
the diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature.
Based on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public
datasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into
diversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European
law and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the
data they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据集精简方法，使用贝塞尔曲线替代完整的SGD轨迹，以解决现有方法中梯度噪声大、收敛慢和内存开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集精简方法存在梯度噪声大、收敛慢和内存开销大的问题，限制了其在临床数据上的应用。

Method: 使用二次贝塞尔曲线连接真实训练轨迹的初始和最终模型状态，以此作为平滑、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 该方法在五个临床数据集上优于现有最佳方法，能够生成临床上有效的模型。

Conclusion: 使用贝塞尔模式连接可以有效替代SGD路径，稳定梯度，加速收敛，并消除对密集轨迹存储的需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，结合了二型模糊集、粒计算和聚类，以提高大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒模型阻碍了透明度，事后可解释性AI（XAI）技术经常会损害准确性或无法提供固有的见解。因此，在环境监测等大数据分析中，机器学习模型的可解释性和可解释性至关重要。

Method: 该框架结合了二型模糊集、粒计算和聚类。

Result: 在UCI空气质量数据集上的应用表明，该框架有效地管理了噪声传感器数据中的不确定性，生成了语言规则，并使用轮廓分数和熵评估了公平性。与DBSCAN和Agglomerative Clustering等基线相比，在可解释性、公平性和效率方面表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在轮廓得分上比1型模糊聚类提高了4％，并且在公平性（熵减少高达1％）和效率方面优于基线。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，并引入基于部分信息分解（PID）的指标来衡量每种资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 模型完全忽略数据波动性，并且偏向于价格变动频率较低的数据。

Conclusion: 模型存在对波动数据的忽视和对低频价格变动的偏向。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Motivation: 研究动机是研究网络安全中对抗性强化学习，并建立一个现实的攻防环境。

Method: 使用深度 Q 网络 (DQN) 训练攻击者和防御者智能体，采用零和奖励框架。

Result: 结果表明，防御者的可观察性和陷阱有效性为成功攻击创造了实质性障碍。奖励塑造和仔细的训练安排对于在这种对抗环境中学习稳定性至关重要。防御者始终在 50,000 多个训练 एपिसोड 中保持战略优势，并且当暴露于复杂的防御策略（包括自适应 IP 阻止和端口特定控制）时，性能增益会放大。

Conclusion: 该零和公式和现实的操作约束使该环境适用于研究自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者协同进化以及迁移学习到现实世界的网络安全场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件变分自编码器 (CVAE) 的生成式逆向设计框架，用于生成具有特定性能目标的高性能候选方案组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于代理模型的优化 (SBO) 方法存在收敛到单点解决方案的局限性，无法充分探索设计空间并忽略潜在有价值的替代拓扑。

Method: 该框架基于 CVAE 学习系统设计参数与其性能之间的概率映射，从而能够生成多样化的高性能候选方案，并以最小化翼型自噪声问题为例进行了应用。

Result: CVAE 框架成功生成了 256 个新颖设计，有效率达 94.1%，其中 77.2% 的有效设计实现了优于 SBO 基线找到的单一最优设计的性能。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅发现了更高质量的解决方案，而且提供了丰富的多样化候选方案，从根本上增强了工程设计过程，从而能够进行多标准决策。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Result: 监督学习方法仍然占主导地位，但无监督异常检测方法越来越多地被采用。深度学习架构已成为变革性工具。混合模型表现出卓越的适应性和检测精度。

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力成为有效的解决方案，但深度学习的可解释性和实时部署仍然具有挑战性。

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的脉冲神经网络（SNN）神经元模型，它比传统模型更有效、更强大，并在各种图像识别任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LIF神经元模型虽然计算效率高，但表达能力有限。更复杂的QIF神经元模型具有更丰富的非线性动力学，但由于训练不稳定而应用受限。

Method: 提出了一种专门为高性能深度脉冲神经网络量身定制的QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，并对其动力学进行了深入分析。为了确保训练稳定性，我们直接从离散化的参数集中推导出替代梯度窗口的解析公式，从而最大限度地减少梯度不匹配。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS上评估了该方法，证明了其优于最先进的基于LIF的方法的能力。

Conclusion: QIF神经元的离散化方法是一种很有前途的LIF神经元替代方案，它将更丰富的动力学与实际的可扩展性相结合。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

Motivation: 研究目的是促进可持续城市发展，研究重点是新兴质生产力 (NQPF)、数字经济进步和人工智能 (AI) 技术对城市碳排放的影响。

Method: 该研究提出结合特征交互建模和注意力机制的MADCN框架，并使用SHAP进行可解释性学习，评估不同特征的贡献。使用包含275个中国城市的面板数据集测试MADCN模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，MADCN模型优于传统机器学习和深度学习基线模型，在测试集上的MSE为406,151.063，MAE为612.304，R-squared值为0.991。SHAP分析表明，人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是碳排放的最有影响力的因素，而NQPF、数字经济指数和AI技术水平也显示出有意义但相对适度的影响。

Conclusion: 结论是推进NQPF、加强数字经济和加速人工智能技术发展可以显著减少城市碳排放。政策制定者应优先考虑将技术创新融入减碳战略，特别是通过促进智能基础设施和加强跨部门的数字化，以有效实现双碳目标。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督学习的电池容量估计模型，该模型利用大规模隐私友好的电动汽车充电数据片段进行预训练，以解决实际数据限制和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的电池容量估计对于缓解消费者对电动汽车电池性能和可靠性的担忧至关重要。然而，严格的隐私法规和标记数据短缺限制了通用容量估计模型的开发，使其难以适应真实世界的数据分布变化。

Method: 该模型基于自监督预训练，采用片段相似性加权掩码输入重建方法，利用对比学习捕获片段之间的高级相似性，从而学习丰富的、可泛化的表示。

Result: 该模型优于最先进的基线模型，即使在受制造商和老化引起的数据分布变化影响的情况下，测试误差也降低了31.9%。

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效地利用隐私友好的数据，学习充电模式的细粒度表示和片段之间的高级关联关系，从而实现更准确的电池容量估计。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为PatternKV的模式对齐残差量化方案，用于减少自回归LLM中KV缓存的成本，尤其是在长上下文和测试时扩展的情况下。该方案通过挖掘代表性的模式向量，将每个KV向量与其最近的模式对齐，并仅量化残差，从而展平KV分布并缩小其范围，提高低比特KV量化的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在自回归LLM推理过程中是主要的内存和带宽瓶颈，尤其是在长上下文和测试时扩展的情况下。KV量化是降低缓存成本的关键手段，但由于原生KV分布缺乏平坦性，精度会急剧下降。

Method: 提出PatternKV，一种模式对齐残差量化方案。它在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量与其最近的模式对齐，并仅量化残差。通过重塑KV分布，展平量化目标并缩小其范围。

Result: 在多个backbone的长上下文和测试时扩展设置中，PatternKV实现了持续的2比特增益，相对于FP16，平均4比特下降0.08%，测试时扩展精度平均提高10%，吞吐量提高1.4倍，同时支持1.25倍更大的批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV能够有效提高低比特KV量化的性能，并在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的符号回归方法，该方法能够对单元感知阈值和条件逻辑进行编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然可以生成可读的公式，但难以编码单元感知阈值和条件逻辑。

Method: 该方法嵌入了具有可学习位置和陡度的可微门（LGO），作为类型化的原语，并映射回物理单元进行审计。

Result: 在两个主要的健康数据集中，硬门变体恢复了临床上合理的切点：71%的评估阈值落在指南锚点的10%以内，100%落在20%以内，同时使用的门比软变体少得多，并且保持在强大的SR基线的竞争精度范围内。在以平滑为主的任务中，门被修剪，保留了简约性。

Conclusion: 该方法可以生成具有显式单元感知阈值的紧凑符号方程，可以根据临床锚点进行审核，从而将可解释性从事后解释转变为建模约束，并为符号回归配备了用于状态切换和治理就绪部署的实用微积分。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Motivation: 在物联网环境中，入侵检测系统至关重要，但传统机器学习方法需要大量数据，且数据共享受限。联邦学习提供了一种替代方案，但面临数据异构和高能耗的挑战。

Method: 提出 OptiFLIDS，在本地训练期间应用剪枝技术以降低模型复杂度和能耗，并采用定制的聚合方法以更好地处理因非独立同分布数据而异的剪枝模型。

Result: 在三个物联网入侵检测数据集上的实验表明，OptiFLIDS 在保持强大检测性能的同时，提高了能源效率。

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS 适用于部署在现实世界的物联网环境中。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用扩散模型解决源分离问题的新方法，该方法无需对源进行显式假设，仅依赖于多个视角或不同观测数据集包含未知源的不同线性变换这一特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然科学中常见的挑战是从观测中分离出不同的、未知的源。传统分析通常依赖于简化的源模型，无法准确再现数据。

Method: 该方法利用扩散模型直接从噪声、不完整的数据中学习复杂的先验分布，从而解决源分离问题。

Result: 该方法即使在没有单独观察到源且观测数据嘈杂、不完整且分辨率不同的情况下也能成功。

Conclusion: 所学习的扩散模型能够从源先验中采样，评估候选源的概率，并从给定观测的源分布的联合后验中提取样本。该方法在一系列合成问题和真实的星系观测中都表现出了有效性。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵集合在训练过程中的分布表示。

Method: 使用一般的13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型，并计算Wasserstein距离。

Result: 发现该模型能有效表示权重矩阵中的相关高斯性，超越了简单高斯模型的适用范围。表示论模型参数和置换不变矩阵可观测量的图论表征为最佳拟合模型和偏离高斯性的小偏差提供了一个可解释的框架。

Conclusion: 测试了不同初始化方案、正则化、层深度和层宽度对该形式的影响，识别了增强特定偏离高斯性的极限，并提出了如何开发更通用但仍具有高度可解释性的模型。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CMT-Benchmark, a dataset of 50 condensed matter theory problems for evaluating LLMs' ability to solve research-level problems in hard sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs on coding and math problem-solving are scarce for advanced research-level problems in hard sciences.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 50 problems in condensed matter theory, verified by expert researchers, and evaluated LLMs by programmatically checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth using machine-grading.

Result: Frontier models struggle with the problems, with the best model (GPT5) solving only 30% and an average of 11.4% across 17 models. Many problems remain unsolved, and answers sometimes violate fundamental physics principles.

Conclusion: The CMT-Benchmark highlights a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs and can guide development toward capable AI research assistants and tutors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

TL;DR: 研究一类非精确设定的鞍点问题，其中优化目标依赖于必须从数据中同时学习的未知参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究假设参数是完全已知的或预先估计的，该框架将优化和学习集成到一个统一的公式中，从而实现更灵活的问题类别。

Method: 提出了两种基于Hamedani & Aybat 2021的加速原始-对偶(APD)的算法。首先，分析了APD方法的简单扩展，通过直接将演化的参数估计代入原始-对偶更新；然后，设计了一种新的学习感知APD方法，该方法通过调整动量更新来显式地考虑参数动态。

Result: 这两种方法都实现了$\\\mathcal{O}(\\log K / K)$的可证明收敛速度，而学习感知方法获得了更严格的$\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$常数，并进一步受益于回溯策略实现的自适应步长选择。

Conclusion: 将该框架扩展到学习问题允许多个最优解的问题，表明针对结构化设置的修改算法实现了$\\\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$速率。在非精确设定的投资组合优化问题上评估了这些方法，并表明与最先进的算法相比，具有优越的实证性能。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的神经网络 Lipschitz 常数估计框架，该框架利用局部信息，在速度上优于现有方法，并产生更严格的 Lipschitz 边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算神经网络的精确 Lipschitz 常数是 NP 难问题，并且标准估计方法计算量大，难以随网络规模扩展。利用局部信息可以提供更严格的 Lipschitz 估计。

Method: 提出了一种组合框架，将广义半定规划 (SDP) 分解为一系列小问题，计算复杂度与网络深度呈线性关系。同时开发了一种变体，通过闭式解实现近乎瞬时的计算。此外，还开发了 ECLipsE-Gen-Local 算法，有效整合了输入端的局部信息。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在多个基准测试中实现了显著加速，并且比全局方法产生了更严格的 Lipschitz 边界。当输入区域足够小时，该算法提供的 Lipschitz 常数严格上界接近于自动微分得到的精确 Jacobian 值。该 Lipschitz 估计与网络鲁棒性密切相关。

Conclusion: 该方法在估计神经网络 Lipschitz 常数方面具有速度快、精度高的优点，并且与网络鲁棒性密切相关。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型架构如何影响跨模态适应方法，尤其是在科学机器学习任务中，现有方法大多集中于仅编码器模型，而忽略了在自然语言处理中更受欢迎且易于扩展的仅解码器模型。

Method: 通过一系列的消融研究，系统地比较仅编码器和仅解码器模型在跨模态适应中的性能，并提出了两种新方法：并行翻转和序列加倍，以改善仅解码器模型的性能。

Result: 发现现有方法直接应用于仅解码器模型时效果较差，且扩展模型规模也无济于事；但通过提出的两种新方法，显著提升了仅解码器模型在所有任务和跨模型适应方法中的性能，缩小了与仅编码器模型的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果拓宽了用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，有望进一步推动科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Decision Transformer通过最大化动作的可能性来进行离线强化学习，存在轨迹拼接和动作外推两个挑战，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: 提出Action Gradient (AG) 方法，利用Q值相对于动作的梯度来优化动作，类似于策略梯度 (PG) 的功能。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了基于DT的算法性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Action Gradient (AG) 能够有效提升Decision Transformer在离线强化学习中的性能。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

TL;DR: 预训练的深度卷积神经网络的 frustration 总是小于 null 模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从统计物理学的角度来看，减少的 frustration 表明网络中编码的无序量小于 null 模型。从功能的角度来看，低 frustration 意味着表示网络的功能表现出接近单调的行为。

Method: 计算与深度神经网络相关的有符号图的 frustration level，并测试该图与结构平衡的接近程度。

Result: 对于我们考虑的所有预训练深度卷积神经网络，我们发现 frustration 总是小于 null 模型中的预期。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络类倾向于具有比 null 模型预期的更有序的行为，并提出了一种新的隐式正则化形式。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Motivation: 现有的对抗训练方法使用交叉熵损失函数和均方误差（MSE）作为正则化目标，但MSE在训练过程中强制执行过度均匀的优化，限制了其在对抗训练场景中的鲁棒性。

Method: 论文提出了两种新的正则化策略：加权对抗互正则化和对抗泛化正则化。前者使用分解的对抗互 Kullback-Leibler 散度（KL-divergence）损失，后者引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的正则化策略能够有效提高对抗训练的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two

### [178] [Margin Adaptive DPO: Leveraging Reward Model for Granular Control in Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05342)
*Hyung Gyu Rho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MADPO: A margin-adaptive DPO method for aligning large language models, addressing the limitations of fixed-temperature DPO and existing adaptive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed temperature in DPO leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting and under-learning. Existing adaptive methods have limitations like uniform regularization, instability, and signal discarding.

Method: Introduces Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a two-step approach: train a reward model to estimate preference margins, then use these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each sample.

Result: MADPO outperforms strong baselines on sentiment generation, achieving gains of up to +33.3% on High Quality data and +10.5% on Low Quality data.

Conclusion: MADPO is a more robust and principled approach to preference alignment, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于迭代数值方法，而 PIANO 直接从 2D 边界条件学习 3D 磁场结构。

Method: PIANO 将高效通道注意力 (ECA) 机制与扩张卷积 (DC) 集成，并通过在训练过程中实施无力和无散度条件来应用物理信息损失。

Result: 在 ISEE NLFFF 数据集上的实验结果表明，PIANO 在准确性方面优于最先进的神经算子，并且在从各种太阳活动区域重建的磁场中显示出与 NLFFF 数据的物理特性的一致性。

Conclusion: PIANO 不仅提高了精度，而且与 NLFFF 数据的物理特性高度一致。

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

*Alex Iacob,Andrej Jovanovic,Mher Safaryan,Meghdad Kurmanji,Lorenzo Sani,Samuel Horváth,William F. Shen,Xinchi Qiu,Nicholas D. Lane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的优化器MT-DAO，用于解决分布式数据并行训练中通信开销大和性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低频通信策略在应用于自适应优化器时，由于时间尺度不匹配，性能不如完全同步的DDP。

Method: 提出MT-DAO优化器，它采用多个慢速和快速移动的一阶动量或梯度来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供收敛性保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中，MT-DAO消除了与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度方面优于低频通信基线，并在以太网互连上减少了6-27%的iso-token wall-clock time。在720M规模下，MT-DAO达到目标困惑度所需的步数减少了24%，时间减少了35%。

Conclusion: MT-DAO能够实现有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理区域训练。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVLinC通过结合Hadamard旋转和轻量级线性校正适配器，减少了极低精度量化中KV缓存的量化误差，从而提高LLM的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM中KV缓存激进量化导致的生成质量下降问题。

Method: 提出KVLinC框架，结合Hadamard旋转降低value的量化误差，并使用轻量级线性校正适配器补偿key的量化误差。

Result: 在LLaMA, Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上的大量评估表明，KVLinC在实现更高KV缓存压缩的同时，始终与强大的基线相匹配或超过它们。与FlashAttention基线相比，推理速度提高了2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC能够有效减少KV缓存量化误差，提高LLM推理效率，并支持高效的长文本LLM推理。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Motivation: PINN 是一种使用深度学习方法逼近偏微分方程解的有效框架。本文旨在改进 PINNsformer 架构。

Method: 通过移除编码器并集成傅里叶特征嵌入来显式地减轻频谱偏差。

Result: S-Pformer 在所有基准测试中均优于 encoder-decoder PINNSformer 架构，在降低参数数量的同时，达到或超过 MLP 性能。

Conclusion: S-Pformer 是一种更有效且性能更高的 PINN 架构。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息理论估计器在高维或小样本情况下表现不佳，因此需要使用神经网络来估计 KL 散度。

Method: 使用具有随机隐藏权重和偏差的浅层神经网络（即随机特征方法）来估计 KL 散度。

Result: 该算法实现了 O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3}) 的 KL 散度估计误差。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的 KL 散度估计方法，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

TL;DR: 本文利用深度学习序列到序列模型，基于长短期记忆网络，预测太阳质子事件发生后24小时的质子流量分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测太阳质子事件的质子流量时间分布对于早期预警和减灾至关重要，太阳质子事件会对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重的辐射危害。

Method: 本文使用了由NOAA GOES观测到的40个良好连接的太阳质子事件数据集(1997-2017)，每个事件都与>=M级的西部半球太阳耀斑和未受干扰的质子流量分布相关联。使用4倍分层交叉验证，评估了seq2seq模型配置(改变隐藏单元和嵌入维度)在多个预测场景下: (i)仅质子输入与质子+x射线组合输入，(ii)原始流量数据与趋势平滑数据，以及(iii)自回归与一次性预测。

Result: 一次性预测始终比自回归预测产生更低的误差，避免了迭代方法中出现的误差累积。在原始数据上，仅质子模型优于质子+x射线模型。然而，对于趋势平滑数据，质子+x射线模型的差距缩小或逆转。趋势平滑通过减少x射线通道的波动显著提高了质子+x射线模型的性能。虽然在趋势平滑数据上训练的模型平均表现最好，但表现最好的模型是在原始数据上训练的，这表明架构选择有时可能超过数据预处理的好处。

Conclusion: 本文研究结果表明，一次性预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑能提高模型性能，但最佳模型架构的选择可能比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在训练深度学习模型时存在准确性差距，DP-MF通过关联不同迭代的隐私噪声来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为NoiseCurve的技术，它利用从公共无标签数据估计的模型曲率来提高交叉迭代噪声相关性的质量。

Result: 在各种数据集、模型和隐私参数上的实验表明，NoiseCurve计算的噪声相关性在准确性方面比DP-MF使用的相关方案提供了一致且显着的改进。

Conclusion: NoiseCurve能够有效提高DP-SGD的准确性。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

### [187] [Draft, Verify, and Improve: Toward Training-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05421)
*Shrenik Bhansali,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVI accelerates large language model autoregressive decoding by using a self-speculative framework with online learning to improve drafting and verification, achieving comparable speedups to state-of-the-art methods with less data and training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in large language models is slow. Existing speculative decoding systems are costly due to offline training, extra components, and sensitivity to distribution drift.

Method: DVI partitions an LLM into a drafter and verifier. The drafter head is updated during generation using accept/reject decisions as supervision signals and a KL->RL schedule for calibration and policy gradient optimization.

Result: DVI achieves a 2.16x wall-time speedup on Spec-Bench, comparable to state-of-the-art methods, with significantly less training data. It also outperforms KL-only online distillation.

Conclusion: Training-aware self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal training overhead.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: LLM agents using tools like Google Search are vulnerable to indirect prompt injections. Current defenses are limited by manually crafted attack patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against prompt injections in LLM agents are limited by the diversity of manually crafted attack patterns.

Method: Propose ARLAS, a framework using adversarial reinforcement learning to co-train an attacker and a defender agent. The attacker generates diverse prompt injections, and the defender learns to defend against them. A population-based learning framework is used to ensure robustness and prevent cyclic learning.

Result: ARLAS-fine-tuned agents achieve a significantly lower attack success rate and improved task success rate on BrowserGym and AgentDojo. The adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks.

Conclusion: ARLAS leads to a more robust agent compared to the base model by generating a diverse set of attacks and training the agent to defend against them.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在元强化学习中，相关任务在它们的最优动作价值函数中共享相似的结构。

Method: 提出了两种 Thompson 风格的算法：(i) MTSRL，它只学习先验均值并使用学习的均值和已知协方差执行后验抽样；以及 (ii) MTSRL+，它额外估计协方差并采用先验扩展来控制有限样本估计误差。此外，我们开发了一种先验对齐技术，该技术将学习先验下的后验与知道真实先验的元预言机结合起来。

Result: 对于已知协方差，我们获得了 O~(H^4S^{3/2}sqrt{ANK}) 元后悔，而对于学习的协方差，我们获得了 O~(H^4S^{3/2}sqrt{AN^3K})；在 K >= O~(H^2) 和 K >= O~(N^2H^2) 之后，两者都恢复了比先验独立更好的行为。在有状态的推荐环境（具有特征和先验错误指定）上的模拟表明，经过短暂的探索后，MTSRL/MTSRL(+) 跟踪元预言机并大大优于先验独立的 RL 和仅限匪徒的元基线。

Conclusion: 我们的结果给出了 Thompson 风格 RL 与学习的 Q 先验的第一个元后悔保证，并为实验丰富的环境提供了实用的方法（通过 RLSVI 进行热启动、OLS 聚合、协方差扩展）。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

*Yurun Song,Zhuoyi Yang,Ian G. Harris,Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的量化方法，用于减少大型语言模型在分布式训练中的通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型扩展迅速，给协作服务器客户端分布式训练带来挑战，尤其是在通信效率和计算开销方面。

Method: 引入自适应混合位激活量化（AMAQ），通过基于特征和层重要性的位正则化，将激活和梯度从高精度压缩到低精度。

Result: 在相同位预算下，AMAQ 优于固定精度方法，对于 LLaMA3 8B 和 Qwen2.5 7B 等模型，生成精度提高约 2.5%，分类精度提高约 1.3%。

Conclusion: AMAQ 可以有效地集成到实际的多机器协作训练设置中，以适度的通信开销提供卓越的推理精度，是具有最小通信成本的协作训练的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

*Luke Thompson,Davy Guan,Dai Shi,Slade Matthews,Junbin Gao,Andi Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ATOM，一个用于多任务分子动力学的预训练Transformer神经算子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习分子动力学模型通常强制执行严格的等方差性，依赖于顺序展开，并且是单任务的，限制了它们的灵活性、模拟效率和泛化能力。

Method: ATOM采用准等方差设计，不需要显式的分子图，并采用时间注意力机制，可以精确地并行解码多个未来状态。为了支持跨化学物质和时间尺度的算子预训练，我们整理了TG80，一个大型、多样且数值稳定的MD数据集，包含80种化合物超过250万飞秒的轨迹。

Result: ATOM在已建立的单任务基准测试（如MD17、RMD17和MD22）上实现了最先进的性能。在TG80上进行多任务预训练后，ATOM在不同的时间范围内对未见分子表现出卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了在精确、高效和可转移的分子动力学模型方面迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化范式，称为无限下降法，通过直接求解一阶最优性条件来重新定义训练过程，实现非迭代收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练方法依赖于小的、局部的、迭代的更新，效率较低。

Method: 通过对其泰勒展开进行解析重求和，得到更新步骤的精确代数方程，并提出了一种直接求解步骤的算法。

Result: 在AION架构上，该方法在单个下降步骤中达到最优。

Conclusion: 无限下降法可以扩展到任何适当封闭的架构，并提出了半解析可优化模型的新类别：Infinity Class。

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了NorMuon优化器，它结合了正交化和神经元级别的自适应学习率，以提高大型语言模型的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新展示了前景，但其与Adam的优势结合未被充分探索。Muon虽然降低了条件数，但导致神经元范数高度不均匀，某些神经元主导优化过程。

Method: 提出了NorMuon，通过维护每个神经元的二阶动量统计量并在正交化后应用行向归一化来解决不平衡问题。同时，开发了FSDP2框架下的高效分布式实现。

Result: 实验表明，NorMuon在多个模型规模上优于Adam和Muon，在1.1B预训练设置中，比Adam训练效率高21.74%，比Muon高11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于条件扩散的结构化状态空间模型（SSSD-ECG），用于生成高质量、个性化和保护隐私的心电图（ECG）数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对共享真实患者心电图（ECG）数据的隐私限制，心脏护理机器学习的发展受到严重阻碍。现有的模型合成ECG在可信度和临床效用方面存在差距。

Method: 该方法基于条件扩散的结构化状态空间模型（SSSD-ECG），并提出了两个创新点：(1) MIDT-ECG（Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training），一种新颖的训练范式，具有时频域监督，以增强生理结构真实感；(2) 多模态人口统计条件，以实现患者特定的合成。

Result: MIDT-ECG 在形态一致性方面取得了显著提高，在所有评估指标中，隐私保证超过基线 4-8%，并显著降低了平均 74% 的导联间相关误差，同时人口统计条件增强了信噪比和个性化。在关键的低数据情况下，在补充了合成 ECG 的数据集上训练的分类器，其性能与仅在真实数据上训练的分类器相当。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过提出的时频结构正则化方案训练的 ECG 合成器，可以在真实数据稀缺时作为个性化、高保真、保护隐私的替代品，从而促进生成式 AI 在医疗保健领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从电路复杂性的角度分析了等变图神经网络（EGNNs）在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力极限，证明了在多项式精度下，具有特定参数的EGNNs可以被多项式大小的一致$\mathsf{TC}^0$阈值电路族模拟，为在晶体系统上进行对称感知图学习提供了复杂性理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络（EGNNs）在晶体结构预测中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在周期性、对称约束设置中的表达能力仍然知之甚少。

Method: 通过电路复杂性的视角，分析了作用于节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵的EGNN层所执行的计算。

Result: 证明了在多项式精度下，对于具有 n 个节点、O(1) 层的嵌入宽度 d=O(n)，以及消息/更新/读出映射的 O(1) 深度、O(n) 宽度 MLP 实例化，这些模型可以通过多项式大小的一致$\mathsf{TC}^0$阈值电路族进行模拟（具有显式的常数深度界限）。

Conclusion: 将 EGNN 归于$\mathsf{TC}^0$为在这种架构下在实际资源约束下可解决的决策和预测问题提供了一个具体的上限，并阐明了哪些架构修改（例如，增加深度、更丰富的几何基元或更宽的层）是超越这种状态所必需的。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了使用脑电图（EEG）和机器学习来客观评估疼痛，旨在解决目前医院疼痛评估依赖主观报告和非特异性生命体征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疼痛评估方法对危重、镇静或认知障碍患者存在不足，可能导致疼痛未充分治疗或阿片类药物滥用。脑电图作为一种非侵入性脑活动测量方法，有潜力辅助识别伤害性感受过程。

Method: 研究使用了来自52名健康成年人的激光诱发疼痛脑电图数据，将四秒脑电图片段转换为537个特征向量，并评估了九种机器学习模型，采用留一参与者交叉验证。

Result: 支持向量机模型达到最佳离线性能，准确率88.9%，推理时间亚毫秒级。特征重要性分析结果与疼痛生理学一致。实时XGBoost模型保持了约4毫秒的端到端延迟和94.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于脑电图的疼痛监测在临床环境中具有技术可行性，为临床验证提供了途径。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO: A local Bayesian optimization method for high-dimensional problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization is challenging in high dimensions.

Method: Jointly learn gradient and Hessian information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. Optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces.

Result: NeST-BO yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art baselines in high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems.

Conclusion: NeST-BO is effective for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.
