Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种针对埃塞俄比亚南部 Wolaita 和 Gofa 两种语言的双语语言识别 (BLID) 任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言社区中，文本可能包含多种语言，因此需要进行双语语言识别。Wolaita 和 Gofa 两种语言之间存在单词相似性和差异，这使得语言识别任务具有挑战性。

Method: 本文采用了基于 BERT 的预训练语言模型和 LSTM 方法的组合。

Result: 该方法在测试集上取得了 0.72 的 F1 分数。

Conclusion: 该研究成果将有助于解决不良社交媒体问题，并为该领域的进一步研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

### [2] [AntiDote: Bi-level Adversarial Training for Tamper-Resistant LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08000)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AntiDote的二层优化方法，用于训练LLM以抵抗恶意微调。该方法使用辅助对抗超网络生成恶意LoRA权重，并训练防御者LLM以消除这些对抗性权重的影响，从而保持其安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全措施难以在保持LLM通用能力的同时，抵抗能够使用全参数微调来消除现有保护措施的恶意攻击者。

Method: 引入AntiDote，这是一种双层优化程序，用于训练LLM以抵抗恶意篡改。AntiDote涉及一个辅助对抗超网络，该网络学习生成恶意LoRA权重，这些权重以防御者模型的内部激活为条件。然后，使用目标训练防御者LLM，以消除这些对抗性权重添加的影响，迫使其保持其安全对齐。

Result: AntiDote在对抗性攻击方面的鲁棒性比抗篡改和取消学习基线高出高达27.4％。至关重要的是，这种鲁棒性是以最小的效用折衷来实现的，在包括MMLU，HellaSwag和GSM8K在内的能力基准测试中，性能下降不到0.5％。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种实用且计算高效的方法，用于构建开放权重模型，其中安全性是更完整和更具弹性的属性。

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

### [3] [MVPBench: A Benchmark and Fine-Tuning Framework for Aligning Large Language Models with Diverse Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08022)
*Yao Liang,Dongcheng Zhao,Feifei Zhao,Guobin Shen,Yuwei Wang,Dongqi Liang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个新的基准测试MVPBench，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在不同国家和人口统计群体中的价值对齐情况，揭示了现有模型的对齐性能差异，并提出了通过微调方法来增强价值对齐的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了文化和人口多样性，导致对价值对齐的全局理解有限。

Method: 构建了一个包含24,020个高质量实例的MVPBench基准测试，该测试带有细粒度的价值标签、个性化问题和丰富的人口统计元数据。使用MVPBench对多个先进的LLM进行了深入分析，并采用了Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)和Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)等轻量级微调方法。

Result: 揭示了LLM在不同地理和人口统计方面的对齐性能存在显著差异。轻量级微调方法可以显著增强领域内和领域外环境中的价值对齐。

Conclusion: 强调了人口感知对齐评估的必要性，并为构建文化适应性和价值敏感的LLM提供了可操作的见解。MVPBench为全球对齐、个性化价值建模和公平的AI开发提供了实践基础。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

TL;DR: NOWJ团队参加了COLIEE 2025比赛的所有五个任务，重点介绍了法律案例蕴涵任务（任务2）的进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索将传统信息检索技术与现代生成模型相结合的混合模型的潜力，为法律信息处理的未来发展提供有价值的参考。

Method: 系统地整合了预排序模型（BM25、BERT、monoT5）、基于嵌入的语义表示（BGE-m3、LLM2Vec）和先进的大型语言模型（Qwen-2、QwQ-32B、DeepSeek-V3），用于摘要、相关性评分和上下文重排序。在任务2中，我们的两阶段检索系统结合了词汇语义过滤和上下文LLM分析。

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in
other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal
Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust
performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based
reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models
integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information
processing.

### [5] [SciGPT: A Large Language Model for Scientific Literature Understanding and Knowledge Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08032)
*Fengyu She,Nan Wang,Hongfei Wu,Ziyi Wan,Jingmian Wang,Chang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciGPT是一个专门为理解科学文献而设计的领域自适应大型语言模型，它通过结合领域知识和创新技术，在科学任务中优于通用LLM（如GPT-4o）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大型语言模型在处理科学文献时，无法捕捉特定领域的细微差别，并且难以胜任复杂的科学任务，阻碍了跨学科研究。

Method: SciGPT基于Qwen3架构，采用低成本领域提炼、稀疏混合专家注意力机制（SMoE）和知识感知适配等创新方法。

Result: SciGPT在ScienceBench基准测试中，在序列标注、生成和推理等核心科学任务上优于GPT-4o，并且在未知的科学任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SciGPT具有促进人工智能增强科学发现的潜力。

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

### [6] [No for Some, Yes for Others: Persona Prompts and Other Sources of False Refusal in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08075)
*Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Paul Röttger,Nino Scherrer,Emanuele Borgonovo,Elmar Plischke,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型(llm)中,不同人口统计学角色对错误拒绝用户请求的影响,发现模型能力越强,角色影响越小,模型和任务选择对错误拒绝的影响更大,角色效应可能被高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是量化llm个性化中,社会人口学角色对模型错误拒绝用户请求的影响,填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 采用了基于蒙特卡罗的方法,测试了15种社会人口学角色(基于性别、种族、宗教和残疾),16种不同的模型,3个任务(自然语言推理、礼貌和冒犯性分类)和9种提示释义。

Result: 研究结果表明,随着模型能力增强,角色对拒绝率的影响减小。某些社会人口学角色会增加一些模型中的错误拒绝,表明对齐策略或安全机制存在潜在偏差。模型选择和任务对错误拒绝有显著影响,尤其是在敏感内容任务中。

Conclusion: 论文认为角色效应可能被高估,其他因素可能起到了更大的作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

### [7] [Culturally transmitted color categories in LLMs reflect a learning bias toward efficient compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08093)
*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)能够像人类一样发展语义系统，并通过信息瓶颈(ib)实现近乎最优的压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否能够发展出高效的、类似人类的语义系统。重点关注颜色领域，将其作为分类认知理论的关键试验台。

Method: 通过对gemini 2.0-flash和llama 3.3-70b-instruct这两种大型语言模型进行实验，复制两项有影响力的人类行为研究。首先进行了一项英语颜色命名研究，然后通过迭代的上下文语言学习，在llm中模拟伪颜色命名系统的文化演变。

Result: gemini与英语母语人士的命名模式非常吻合，并获得了非常高的ib效率评分，而llama表现出高效但复杂度较低的系统。类似于人类，llm迭代地将最初随机的系统重组为更高的ib效率，并增加了与世界语言中观察到的模式的对齐。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够发展出感知上扎根的、类似人类的语义系统，并由与人类语言语义效率相同的基本原则驱动。

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

*Kosei Uemura,David Guzmán,Quang Phuoc Nguyen,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi,En-shiun Annie Lee,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN是一种双阶段模型堆叠框架，它使用课程学习策略，从通用双语比特文本到特定任务数据，并且只调整一小部分DoRA权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言上存在较大差距。

Method: MERLIN，一种双阶段模型堆叠框架，使用课程学习策略。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准测试中，MERLIN比MindMerger提高了+12.9 pp的精确匹配准确率，并且优于GPT-4o-mini。在MGSM和MSVAMP上也获得了持续的收益（+0.9和+2.8 pp）。

Conclusion: MERLIN在低资源和高资源环境中都表现出有效性。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

*Nivedha Sivakumar,Natalie Mackraz,Samira Khorshidi,Krishna Patel,Barry-John Theobald,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 先前的研究假设偏差不会从预训练的LLM传递到调整后的模型。本文通过研究因果模型中提示调整下的偏差转移假设(BTH)来否定这一假设。研究发现，偏差可以通过提示传递，并且流行的基于提示的缓解方法不能始终如一地阻止偏差传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究提示调整下因果模型中的偏差转移假设(BTH)，因为提示是一种在实际应用中非常流行的调整策略。先前的研究存在一个危险的假设，即偏差不会从预训练的LLM传递到调整后的模型，本文旨在验证或否定这个假设。

Method: 在提示调整下，研究因果模型中的偏差转移假设(BTH)。通过改变少量样本的组成参数来研究偏差的相关性，例如样本大小、刻板印象内容、职业分布和代表性平衡。

Result: 偏差可以通过提示传递，并且流行的基于提示的缓解方法不能始终如一地阻止偏差传递。内在偏差和提示调整后的偏差之间的相关性在不同的人口统计和任务中仍然是中等到强烈的。不同的prompt-based debiasing策略有不同的优势，但没有一种能够始终如一地减少跨模型、任务或人口统计的偏差转移。

Conclusion: 纠正内在模型中的偏差，并可能提高推理能力，可以防止偏差传播到下游任务。

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

*Supriya Lall,Christian Farrell,Hari Pathanjaly,Marko Pavic,Sarvesh Chezhian,Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“口头算法”(VA)的范式，它利用具有已建立的理论理解的经典算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过一次性查询LLM来获得推理任务的正确答案，但是结果不尽如人意。

Method: VA将任务分解为对自然语言字符串的简单基本操作，LLM应该能够可靠地回答这些操作，并将LLM的范围限制在这些简单的任务中。例如，对于排序一系列自然语言字符串，“口头排序”在已知且经过良好分析的排序算法(例如，双调排序网络)中使用LLM作为二进制比较oracle。

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了这种方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 总结了口头算法在排序和聚类任务上的有效性

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在主观任务中，注释者过滤方法如何影响数据集中多样性的保留，发现现有方法在去除注释者时，往往会牺牲标签多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使机器学习数据集准确反映人群中的不同意见，必须保留数据标签中的变异，同时过滤掉垃圾信息或低质量的回复。如何在注释者的可靠性和代表性之间取得平衡？

Method: 本文实证评估了一系列注释者过滤的启发式方法，观察它们如何影响主观任务中变异的保留。

Result: 研究发现，为单一真实标签下的变异被认为是噪声的环境而设计的方法，通常会移除意见不一致的注释者，而不是垃圾注释者，从而在准确性和标签多样性之间引入了次优的权衡。保守的注释者移除设置（<5%）效果最好，之后所有测试的方法都会增加与真实平均标签的平均绝对误差。对合成垃圾信息的分析表明，这些方法通常假设垃圾注释者的随机性低于真实的垃圾制造者：大多数垃圾制造者在分布上与真实的注释者无法区分，少数可区分的垃圾制造者倾向于给出固定的答案，而不是随机的答案。

Conclusion: 需要考虑标签多样性的垃圾信息移除方法。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

*Yehudit Aperstein,Alon Gottlib,Gal Benita,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个语义覆盖关系（SCR）建模的新框架，该框架根据文档的信息内容对齐方式对文档对进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信息如何在文档间共享，对于信息检索、摘要和内容对齐等任务至关重要。

Method: 采用基于问答（QA）的方法，使用文档间共享问题的可回答性作为语义覆盖的指标。构建了一个合成数据集，通过释义源段落并选择性地省略信息，从而精确控制内容重叠。

Result: 判别模型明显优于生成模型，RoBERTa-base 模型实现了 61.4% 的最高准确率，基于随机森林的模型表现出最佳平衡，宏平均 F1 值为 52.9%。

Conclusion: 问答提供了一个有效的视角来评估风格多样的文本之间的语义关系，从而深入了解当前模型在表面相似性之外进行信息推理的能力。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Subtrait (latent-trait components) assessment presents a promising path
toward enhancing transparency of automated writing scores. We prototype

Method: 使用Llama 3和Qwen激活修补模型，为ParaDetox和SST-2数据集中性文本生成合成的有害对应文本，并进行微调训练。

Result: 在合成数据上微调的模型性能始终不如在人工数据上训练的模型，联合指标的性能下降高达30%。

Conclusion: LLM在生成有害内容时使用的侮辱性词汇重复性高，未能捕捉到人类毒性的细微差别和多样性，表明当前LLM在此领域存在局限性，强调了多样化的人工标注数据对于构建强大的解毒系统的重要性。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在资源有限的情况下，使用小规模语言模型进行结构化数据提取的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在结构化数据提取方面成本高昂，且需要大量高质量数据集，这对于小型团队来说是不切实际的。目前的研究主要集中在大型模型上，缺乏关于小型模型在低资源、多任务条件下可靠性的证据。

Method: 提出了ETLCH，一个基于LLaMA的十亿参数模型，使用低秩适应方法在少量样本上进行微调，用于JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别。

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上优于强大的基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著收益。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过良好调整的小型模型能够以较低的计算成本提供稳定和准确的结构化输出，从而在资源受限的环境中实现经济高效且可靠的信息提取流程。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语音关系抽取数据集 CommonVoice-SpeechRE 和一个名为 RPG-MoGe 的新框架，用于解决现有语音关系抽取数据不足和模型性能受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音关系抽取基准数据集严重依赖合成数据，缺乏足够数量和多样性的真实人类语音。现有的模型也存在单一样式和语义对齐不足的问题。

Method: 本文提出了 Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative Ensemble (RPG-MoGe) 框架，该框架包含多阶 triplet 生成 ensemble 策略和基于 CNN 的潜在关系预测头。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文提出的方法优于目前最好的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个新的基准数据集和一个有效的语音关系抽取解决方案。

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

TL;DR: 本文全面回顾了针对自动事实核查（AFC）系统的对抗性攻击，对现有攻击方法进行了分类，评估了它们对 AFC 系统造成的影响，并探讨了防御措施的最新进展以及需要进一步研究的开放性研究问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息时代，虚假信息传播泛滥，事实核查至关重要。现有的自动事实核查系统容易受到对抗性攻击，这些攻击会扭曲事实，误导决策者，并最终破坏事实核查模型的可靠性。目前对 AFC 系统对抗性攻击的全面概述仍然缺乏。

Method: 本文深入回顾了针对 FC 的对抗性攻击，对现有攻击方法进行了分类，并评估了它们对 AFC 系统造成的影响。此外，本文还研究了对抗性防御的最新进展，并强调了需要进一步探索的开放性研究问题。

Result: 本文的研究结果强调，迫切需要能够抵御对抗性操纵的弹性 FC 框架，以保持较高的验证准确性。

Conclusion: 本文首次深入回顾了针对 FC 的对抗性攻击，强调了开发能够抵御对抗性操纵的弹性 FC 框架的迫切需求。

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文研究大型语言模型（LLM）中是否存在“默认赞同”的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否会像人类一样，在调查中表现出不基于真实想法而赞同某种观点的倾向。

Method: 通过在不同模型、任务和语言（英语、德语和波兰语）中进行实验，来研究LLM中是否存在默认赞同的偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明，与人类相反，LLM倾向于回答“否”，无论这是否意味着赞同或不赞同。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型与人类不同，它们表现出一种回答“否”的偏见，而不是默认赞同的偏见。

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

*Pia Sommerauer,Giulia Rambelli,Tommaso Caselli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Persona-prompting对LLM生成文本中刻板印象的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Persona-prompting是否会影响LLM在生成将社会人口统计学类别与刻板印象或非刻板印象属性联系起来的短文本时，产生不同程度的语言抽象，而语言抽象是刻板印象的一种标志。

Method: 使用Linguistic Expectancy Bias框架，分析六个开放权重LLM在三种prompting条件下的输出，比较11个persona驱动的response与通用AI助手的response。引入Self-Stereo数据集，该数据集包含来自Reddit的自我报告的刻板印象。通过具体性、特异性和否定三个指标来衡量抽象性。

Result: Persona-prompting在调节语言抽象性方面存在局限性，证实了对personas作为社会人口群体代表性的批评，并引发了人们对传播刻板印象风险的担忧，即使在看似唤起边缘化群体的声音时也是如此。

Conclusion: Persona-prompting在减轻LLM中的刻板印象方面效果有限，即使试图模拟边缘化群体的声音也可能加剧刻板印象。

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrinityX是一个在Transformer架构中加入混合校准专家(MoCaE)的模块化对齐框架，它利用为每个HHH维度单独训练的专家，通过校准的、任务自适应的路由机制整合它们的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常孤立地优化单个对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致的行为。混合专家(MoE)架构虽然提供了模块化，但其路由校准较差，限制了其在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: TrinityX包含一个混合校准专家(MoCaE)，它通过校准的、任务自适应的路由机制整合专家信号，形成统一的、对齐感知的表示。

Result: 在Alpaca (Helpfulness)、BeaverTails (Harmlessness)和TruthfulQA (Honesty)三个标准对齐基准上，TrinityX的胜率相对提高了32.5%，安全评分提高了33.9%，真实性提高了28.4%。此外，与之前的基于MoE的方法相比，TrinityX减少了超过40%的内存使用和推理延迟。

Conclusion: TrinityX优于强大的基线，校准路由非常重要，交叉模型评估证实了TrinityX在不同的LLM骨干网络上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于一致性的数据选择方法CM-Align，以构建高质量的多语言偏好数据，从而提高多语言对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建多语言偏好数据时存在噪声，因为并非所有英语回复都高质量，且构建偏好对的方法存在偏差。

Method: 该方法包括一致性引导的英语参考选择和基于跨语言一致性的多语言偏好数据构建两部分。

Result: 在三个LLM和三个常见任务上的实验结果表明该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 构建高质量的偏好数据对于提高多语言对齐性能至关重要。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

*Dima Galat,Diego Molla-Aliod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了如何使用大型语言模型（LLM）进行信息检索（IR），以及零样本模型的集成如何在特定领域的Yes/No问答任务上实现最先进的性能。通过在BioASQ挑战任务上的评估，表明集成模型可以胜过单个LLM，并在某些情况下与领域调整系统相媲美或超越，同时保留了通用性，避免了昂贵的微调或标记数据的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于需要精确解释来自庞大、复杂和快速发展的语料库的专业知识，生物医学问答（QA）提出了重大挑战。

Method: 该方法聚合了来自多个LLM变体的输出，包括Anthropic和Google的模型，以合成更准确和稳健的答案。研究还强调了上下文长度与性能之间的关系。

Result: 结果表明，集成模型可以胜过单个LLM，并在某些情况下与领域调整系统相媲美或超越。此外，研究强调了上下文长度与性能之间的关系：虽然扩展的上下文旨在提供有价值的证据，但它们同时存在信息稀释和模型迷失方向的风险。

Conclusion: 基于集成的零样本方法，当与有效的RAG流程配对时，构成了生物医学问答领域中领域调整系统的实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了大型语言模型（LLM）在医学领域中记忆医疗训练数据的程度，并评估了其普遍性、特征、数量以及潜在的下游影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域（如诊断辅助、医学问答和临床信息合成）展现出巨大潜力。但LLM在多大程度上记忆医疗训练数据仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 该研究通过系统分析常见适应场景来评估LLM的记忆能力：(1)在医学语料库上持续预训练，(2)在标准医学基准上进行微调，(3)在真实临床数据上进行微调，包括来自耶鲁纽黑文医疗系统的超过13,000份独特的住院病人记录。

Result: 研究结果表明，在所有适应场景中，记忆现象普遍存在，且显著高于在一般领域中的报告。记忆可以分为三种类型：有益的（例如，准确回忆临床指南和生物医学参考文献）、无信息的（例如，重复的免责声明或模板化的医学文件语言）和有害的（例如，重新生成数据集特异性或敏感的临床内容）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了实用的建议，以促进有益的记忆，减少无信息的记忆，并减轻有害的记忆。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方面情感分析方法，通过结合句法和语义信息，更准确地识别情感词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂的语义关系，容易受到噪声的干扰。

Method: 提出了一种最优传输增强的句法-语义图网络（OTESGN），包括句法图感知注意力、语义最优传输注意力和自适应注意力融合模块。

Result: 在Twitter和Laptop14基准测试中，OTESGN取得了state-of-the-art的结果，分别超过了之前的最佳模型+1.01% F1和+1.30% F1。

Conclusion: OTESGN能够精确定位观点词和抵抗噪声。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Motivation: 先前的工作依赖于少量手动编写的模板，而本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该系统将来自 12 个来源的智能采样与受 StrongREJECT 启发的 LLM 评估相结合，并记录完全可审计的日志。

Result: 在 GPT-4.1 上获得了 44.8% 的总体成功率 (103/230)，并发现了两个新的模板系列。

Conclusion: 结构层面的搜索是获得更强的单轮探测的可重现途径，并强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

TL;DR: 提出了延迟流建模（DSM），一种灵活的流式多模态序列到序列学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列到序列生成通常以离线方式进行，模型在生成第一个输出时间步之前消耗完整的输入序列。或者，流式序列到序列依赖于学习一种策略来选择何时在输入流上前进，或者写入输出流。

Method: DSM 使用仅解码器语言模型对已经时间对齐的流进行建模。通过将对齐移动到预处理步骤，并在流之间引入适当的延迟，DSM 提供了来自任何输入组合的任意输出序列的流式推理。

Result: 在 ASR 和 TTS 这两个主要的序列到序列任务上进行了广泛的实验，表明 DSM 提供了最先进的性能和延迟，同时支持任意长度的序列，甚至与离线基线相比也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: DSM 是一种有竞争力的流式序列到序列学习方法，在 ASR 和 TTS 任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

TL;DR: 研究了不同自回归Transformer模型的事实知识存储和检索机制，发现Qwen模型与其他模型（GPT、LLaMA、DeepSeek）不同，其早期层的注意力模块对事实回忆的贡献更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解基于Transformer的语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现有针对性的模型编辑至关重要。以往主要针对GPT模型的研究发现，早期层的MLP模块是事实回忆的关键因素。但是，这些发现是否可以推广到不同的自回归架构仍然不清楚。

Method: 对包括GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek在内的多个模型进行了全面的事实回忆评估，分析了事实信息的编码和访问方式。

Result: 发现Qwen模型的行为与以往的模式不同：最早期的注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆的贡献更大。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使在自回归Transformer系列中，架构差异也可能导致事实回忆的机制存在根本不同。

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

Motivation: 在动态、无监督的环境中，评估大型语言模型（LLM）注释的质量仍然具有挑战性，在这些环境中，oracle反馈稀缺且传统方法失败。

Method: 学生模型充当无监督反馈机制，采用基于用户偏好的多数投票策略来评估LLM输出的一致性。为了系统地衡量LLM生成的注释的可靠性，我们引入了一致和不一致（CAI）比率，这是一种新的无监督评估指标。

Result: 应用于跨四个LLM的十个开放域NLP数据集，CAI比率证明与LLM准确性具有很强的正相关性。

Conclusion: CAI比率是实际环境中无监督评估和模型选择的重要工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

### [30] [MoVoC: Morphology-Aware Subword Construction for Geez Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08812)
*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Dren Fazlija,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的词条化器 MoVoC-Tok，它将监督形态分析集成到子词汇表中，以解决基于子词的词条化方法在低资源、形态复杂的语言中无法保留形态边界的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于子词的词条化方法通常不能保留形态边界，这在低资源、形态复杂的语言中尤其明显。

Method: 结合了基于语素和字节对编码 (BPE) 标记的混合分割方法，以保持形态完整性，同时保持词汇意义。为了解决资源稀缺问题，我们为四种吉兹文字语言整理并发布了手动注释的语素数据，并为其中两种语言发布了语素感知词汇表。

Result: 虽然所提出的词条化方法并没有显着提高自动翻译质量，但我们观察到内在指标、MorphoScore 和边界精度的一致改进，突出了形态感知分割在提高语言保真度和标记效率方面的价值。

Conclusion: 我们的语素注释数据集和词条化器将公开提供，以支持低资源、形态丰富的语言的进一步研究。

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何为大型语言模型构建有效的非英语训练语料库，重点关注葡萄牙语，并提出了适用于其他语言的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对英语以外的语言的有效训练语料库构建方法了解不足。

Method: 研究人员探索了构建基于网络的语料库的可扩展方法，并将其应用于构建新的120B token葡萄牙语语料库。他们还研究了不同的数据选择和预处理策略对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，特定于语言的过滤流程（包括STEM和toxic content分类器）的价值，以及将模型调整到目标语言可提高性能。

Conclusion: 高质量、特定于语言的数据对于多语言LLM的开发至关重要。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

TL;DR: LLM的使用引入了系统性偏差和随机误差，导致社会科学研究中出现各种错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）正在迅速改变社会科学研究，但研究人员的实施选择会导致LLM输出变化，从而产生偏差和误差。

Method: 通过复制21项已发表的社会科学研究中的37个数据注释任务，使用18个不同的模型，分析了1300万个LLM标签，并测试了2361个实际假设。

Result: 发现对于最先进的模型，大约三分之一的假设基于LLM注释的数据得出不正确的结论，而对于小型语言模型，这一比例为一半。人为注释有助于减少假阳性结果，并改善模型选择。常见的回归估计器校正技术在降低LLM入侵风险方面基本无效，因为它们会在 I 类错误和 II 类错误之间进行权衡。

Conclusion: 即使是高度准确的模型也无法完全消除LLM入侵的风险。需要对接近显着性阈值的结果进行更严格的验证。有意进行LLM入侵非常简单，只需少量LLM和一些提示释义，任何内容都可以呈现为具有统计学意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一种新的城市洪水分类框架，它使用先进的深度学习技术，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖于单模数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件中固有的动态、非线性关系。现有的注意力机制和集成学习方法在分层细化、跨模特征集成和适应噪声或非结构化环境方面存在局限性，导致次优的洪水分类性能。

Method: XFloodNet集成了三个新组件：(1)一种分层跨模门控注意机制，动态对齐视觉和文本特征；(2)一种异构卷积自适应多尺度注意模块，利用频率增强通道注意和频率调制空间注意来提取和优先考虑判别性洪水相关特征；(3)一种级联卷积Transformer特征细化技术，通过自适应缩放和级联操作协调分层特征。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个基准数据集上，XFloodNet实现了最先进的F1分数，分别为93.33%、82.24%和88.60%，超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet是一种有效的城市洪水分类框架，它使用先进的深度学习技术，并在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为视频并行缩放（VPS）的推理方法，可以在不增加上下文窗口的情况下扩展模型的感知带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加输入帧数以捕捉细粒度的时间细节会导致计算成本过高和性能下降。

Method: 通过运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的唯一不相交子集。通过聚合这些互补流的输出概率，VPS集成了比单次传递更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在Video-MME和EventHallusion等基准测试中，VPS始终且显着地提高了各种模型架构和规模（2B-32B）的性能。

Conclusion: VPS比其他并行替代方案更具优势，并且与其他解码策略互补，为增强VideoLLM的时间推理能力提供了一个内存高效且强大的框架。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中在文本数据上，而现实世界的社交媒体内容越来越多地将文本与视觉元素结合起来，因此需要更先进的多模态方法。

Method: 该方法首先使用大型语言模型从源文本中检索与立场相关的摘要，然后使用领域感知图像标题生成器在目标主题的上下文中解释视觉内容。然后，通过一个专门的 Transformer 模块将这些模态与回复文本一起进行联合建模，该模块可以捕获文本和图像之间的交互。

Conclusion: 该模态融合框架集成了多种模态，以促进稳健的立场分类。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应概率匹配损失（APML），用于点云预测任务，它是一种可微的近似一对一匹配方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云预测损失函数（如CD, HyperCD, InfoCD）依赖于最近邻分配，导致点云拥塞和覆盖不佳；EMD虽然效果好，但计算复杂度高。

Method: APML利用Sinkhorn迭代，在基于成对距离的温度缩放相似性矩阵上进行操作，实现可微的一对一匹配近似。自动计算温度以保证最小分配概率。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和CSI2PC上，APML能更快收敛，实现更好的空间分布（尤其在低密度区域），并获得更好或相当的性能。

Conclusion: APML是一种高效且有效的点云预测损失函数，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的红外小目标检测框架L-RPCANet，该框架在参数轻量性和噪声鲁棒性方面都具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度展开网络(DUNs)在红外小目标检测(ISTD)中表现出良好的性能，但现有方法在参数轻量性和噪声鲁棒性方面仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 构建了分层瓶颈结构，以减少和增加单通道输入红外图像中的通道维度，实现通道特征细化；设计了噪声降低模块，以增强抗复杂噪声的鲁棒性；利用squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets)作为通道注意力机制。

Result: 在ISTD数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法优于RPCANet, DRPCANet, 和RPCANet++等当前最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的L-RPCANet框架在红外小目标检测中实现了轻量化和鲁棒性的良好平衡。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的超稀疏采样(USS)策略，用于降低高速视频采集中的功耗，并使用一种名为BSTFormer的稀疏Transformer来提高重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数码相机功耗高，尤其是在高分辨率和高帧率下，因此需要降低功耗。

Method: 提出USS策略，即在每个空间位置只有一个子帧设置为1，其余为0。同时，设计了一种基于DMD的编码系统来验证USS策略的有效性，并提出了BSTFormer，一种利用局部块注意力、全局稀疏注意力和全局时间注意力的稀疏Transformer。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的大量结果表明，该方法明显优于所有先前的最先进算法。

Conclusion: USS策略具有比RS策略更高的动态范围，并且由于其固定的曝光时间，是实现片上完整视频SCI系统的理想选择。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Motivation: 由于现实世界中致命事件的稀有性以及数据收集中的伦理问题，导致在监控视频中检测枪击和刺伤等致命事件仍然很困难。

Method: 本文提出了一个致命视频异常数据集和生成框架GTA-Crime，并提出了一种使用Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级领域自适应策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合GTA-Crime数据集和领域自适应策略能够持续提高真实世界致命暴力检测的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文发布了一个新的致命视频异常检测数据集GTA-Crime以及数据生成框架，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: RepViT-CXR: A channel replication strategy for adapting grayscale CXR images to Vision Transformers (ViTs) for improved TB and pneumonia detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most ViT architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without information loss.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on TB-CXR, Pediatric Pneumonia, and Shenzhen TB datasets, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for real-world clinical screening systems.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的端到端网络，用于检测由左右脑萎缩引起的基于疾病的不对称性，该网络由 3D CNN 编码器和对称交互 Transformer (SIT) 组成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用 CNN 和 Transformer 构建了一个性能良好的网络，但它们大多基于预训练或忽略了由脑部疾病引起的不对称特征。

Method: 该方法包括一个 3D CNN 编码器和一个对称交互 Transformer (SIT)。在相等的网格块提取操作之后，相应的左右半球特征对齐，然后输入到 SIT 进行诊断分析。

Result: 在 ADNI 数据集上评估了该方法，结果表明，与几种 CNN 方法和 CNN 结合通用 Transformer 的方法相比，该方法实现了更好的诊断准确率 (92.5%)。

Conclusion: 可视化结果表明，该网络更多地关注脑萎缩区域，特别是 AD 引起的非对称病理特征，证明了该方法的可解释性和有效性。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

TL;DR: EVDI++是一个自监督框架，用于事件相机的视频去模糊和插帧，利用事件相机的高时间分辨率来减轻运动模糊并实现中间帧预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于帧的相机由于曝光时间延长，经常会产生明显的视觉模糊和帧间信息丢失，从而显著降低视频质量。

Method: 设计可学习双积分 (LDI) 网络来估计参考帧和清晰潜在图像之间的映射关系。然后，通过引入基于学习的分割重建模块来细化粗略结果并优化整体训练效率，从而能够以不同的曝光间隔转换图像。设计了一种自适应的无参数融合策略来获得最终结果，利用嵌入在并发事件的 LDI 输出中的置信度。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视频去模糊和插值任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了 EVDI++，一个统一的自监督框架，用于事件相机的视频去模糊和插帧。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于Mamba的Hyperspectral物体跟踪网络(HyMamba)，它通过状态空间模块(SSMs)统一了光谱、跨深度和时间建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高光谱跟踪器通常无法捕获内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互。

Method: 提出了光谱状态集成(SSI)模块，该模块能够逐步细化和传播具有跨深度和时间光谱信息的光谱特征。在每个SSI中嵌入了高光谱Mamba (HSM)模块，以通过三个定向扫描SSM同步学习空间和光谱信息。基于SSI和HSM，HyMamba从假彩色和高光谱输入构建联合特征，并通过与从原始高光谱图像中提取的原始光谱特征的交互来增强它们。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，HyMamba实现了最先进的性能。例如，它在HOTC2020数据集上实现了73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数。

Conclusion: HyMamba在Hyperspectral物体跟踪上实现了state-of-the-art的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在回答关于图像视觉属性的问题时，依赖于训练中学习到的固有偏见，并且当问题需要关注图像的特定区域时，这种偏见会加剧。

Method: 开发了一个多维检查框架，以系统地确定输入数据的哪些特征（包括图像和随附的提示）会导致性能上的差异。使用开源VLM，进一步检查了注意力值如何随变化的输入参数（例如，图像大小、图像中对象的数量、背景颜色、提示特异性）而波动。

Result: 图像特征和提示特异性的微小修改会导致VLM制定答案的方式发生巨大变化，并最终影响其整体性能。

Conclusion: 即使图像特征和提示特异性的微小修改也会导致VLM制定答案的方式发生巨大变化，并最终影响其整体性能。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Motivation: 现有3D点云的广义零样本语义分割模型倾向于做出有偏差的预测，通常偏向于训练期间遇到的类别。这个问题在3D应用中更为突出，因为训练数据的规模通常小于基于图像的任务。

Method: E3DPC-GZSL通过将基于证据的不确定性估计器集成到分类器中来解决过度自信的问题。然后，使用该估计器，利用动态校准的堆叠因子调整预测概率，该因子考虑了逐点预测的不确定性。此外，E3DPC-GZSL引入了一种新的训练策略，通过改进语义空间来提高不确定性估计。这是通过将可学习参数与文本派生的特征合并来实现的，从而改善了对未见数据的模型优化。

Result: 在ScanNet v2和S3DIS等广义零样本语义分割数据集上，该方法取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL方法有效地解决了3D点云广义零样本语义分割中的过度自信问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架有效地解决了现有弱监督目标检测方法的局限性，并在PASCAL VOC数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的早期退出训练方案，以解决资源受限平台上的实时图像分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的平台上进行实时图像分类，需要在精度、延迟和功耗之间取得平衡。传统的早期退出训练方法存在协方差偏移问题，影响了效率与精度之间的权衡。

Method: 提出了Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE)，这是一种顺序训练方法，可使分支训练与推理时的数据分布保持一致。此外，还提出了一种基于1D卷积的轻量级分支架构和Class Precision Margin (CPM)校准方法。

Result: 在具有ResNet18骨干网络的CINIC-10数据集上进行的实验表明，BTS-EE在64种配置中始终优于非增强训练，在计算量减少高达45%的情况下，精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: 这些结果扩展了在实时图像处理系统中部署CNN的设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和基于无人机的监控等应用提供了实际的效率提升。

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种检索增强的视觉语言模型框架，用于提高恶性黑色素瘤的早期诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的卷积神经网络在皮肤镜图像分析中忽略了临床元数据，并且需要大量的预处理。视觉语言模型虽然提供了一种多模态的替代方案，但在通用领域数据上训练时，难以捕捉临床特异性。

Method: 该方法将语义相似的患者病例纳入诊断提示中，无需微调即可实现知情的预测。

Result: 该方法显著提高了分类准确率和误差校正能力，优于传统的基线方法。

Conclusion: 检索增强提示为临床决策支持提供了一种稳健的策略。

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

TL;DR: 提出 InsFusion，通过从原始和融合特征中提取 proposal 并利用这些 proposal 查询原始特征来减少累积误差的影响，从而提高 3D 目标检测的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 多视角相机和激光雷达的三维目标检测是自动驾驶和智能交通的关键组成部分。然而，在基本特征提取、透视变换和特征融合的过程中，噪声和误差会逐渐累积。

Method: 提出 InsFusion，从原始和融合特征中提取 proposal，并利用这些 proposal 查询原始特征，从而减轻累积误差的影响。此外，通过结合应用于原始特征的注意力机制，进一步减轻累积误差的影响。

Result: 在 nuScenes 数据集上的实验表明，InsFusion 与各种先进的基线方法兼容，并为 3D 目标检测提供新的最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InsFusion 兼容各种先进的基线方法，并为 3D 目标检测提供新的最先进的性能。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and
fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby
mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

### [56] [Bitrate-Controlled Diffusion for Disentangling Motion and Content in Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08376)
*Xiao Li,Qi Chen,Xiulian Peng,Kai Yu,Xie Chen,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用框架，将视频数据分解为动态运动和静态内容组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究有较多假设和归纳偏见，所以我们提出了一个自监督的pipeline。

Method: 利用基于Transformer的架构为帧间运动和clip-wise内容联合生成灵活的隐式特征，并结合低比特率向量量化作为信息瓶颈，以促进解耦并形成有意义的离散运动空间。码率控制的潜在运动和内容被用作去噪扩散模型的条件输入，以促进自监督表征学习。

Result: 在真实世界的头部说话视频上，通过运动转移和自回归运动生成任务验证了我们解耦的表征学习框架。此外，我们还表明我们的方法可以推广到其他类型的视频数据，例如2D卡通人物的像素精灵。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为解耦视频表征的自监督学习提供了一个新的视角，为更广泛的视频分析和生成领域做出了贡献。

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

*Dubing Chen,Huan Zheng,Yucheng Zhou,Xianfei Li,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果损失，它支持对模块化的2D到3D转换管道进行整体的端到端监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉的3D语义占据预测方法通常依赖于模块化管道，这些模块通常独立优化或使用预配置的输入，导致级联错误。

Method: 设计了一个新的因果损失，它能够对模块化的2D到3D转换管道进行整体的端到端监督。该方法包括：用于自适应语义映射的通道分组提升、用于增强相机扰动鲁棒性的可学习相机偏移和用于有效特征传播的归一化卷积。

Result: 在Occ3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明了对相机扰动的显著鲁棒性和改进的2D到3D语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提出的语义因果感知2D到3D转换，实现了最先进的性能，并展示了对相机扰动的显著鲁棒性和改进的2D到3D语义一致性。

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

*Cuong Nguyen,Dung T. Tran,Hong Nguyen,Xuan-Vu Phan,Nam-Phong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种垂直残差自编码器（VRAE）架构，用于交通监控中的图像增强任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实交通监控中，车辆图像常受恶劣天气、光照不足或高速运动的影响，导致图像噪声和模糊，降低车牌识别系统的准确性。快速实时地恢复这些退化图像是提高识别性能的关键预处理步骤。

Method: 该方法采用了一种增强策略，该策略利用辅助块在每个编码阶段注入输入感知特征，以指导表示学习过程，与传统的自编码器相比，能够在整个网络中更好地保持一般信息。

Result: 在具有可见车牌的车辆图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法始终优于自编码器（AE）、生成对抗网络（GAN）和基于流的方法。与相同深度的AE相比，PSNR提高了约20%，NMSE降低了约50%，SSIM提高了1%，而参数仅略微增加了约1%。

Conclusion: VRAE架构在交通监控图像增强方面表现出色，能够在参数增加不多的情况下显著提高图像质量和识别准确率。

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

### [59] [Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421)
*Keisuke Toida,Taigo Sakai,Naoki Kato,Kazutoyo Yokota,Takeshi Nakamura,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCFusion的框架，用于改进多视角多目标跟踪(MVMOT)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将来自多个摄像头的特征投影到统一的鸟瞰图(BEV)空间，以提高对遮挡的鲁棒性。但是，这种投影会引入特征失真和由物体尺度随距离变化而引起的非均匀密度，从而降低了融合表示的质量，并降低了检测和跟踪精度。

Method: 该框架结合了三种技术来改进多视角特征集成：稀疏变换，密度感知加权和多视角一致性损失。

Result: 在WildTrack上达到95.9％的IDF1得分，在MultiviewX上达到89.2％的MODP，优于基线方法TrackTacular。

Conclusion: SCFusion有效地缓解了传统BEV投影的局限性，并为多视角对象检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒而准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

*Payal Varshney,Adriano Lucieri,Christoph Balada,Sheraz Ahmed,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频反事实解释框架LD-ViCE，用于解释视频AI模型的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解释技术通常存在时间连贯性有限、鲁棒性不足以及缺乏可操作的因果洞察力等问题。当前的反事实解释方法通常不包含来自目标模型的指导，从而降低了语义保真度和实用性。

Method: 利用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中运行，并通过额外的细化步骤生成逼真且可解释的反事实。

Result: 在三个不同的视频数据集上，LD-ViCE优于最新的方法，R2分数提高了68%，同时推理时间减少了一半。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE是朝着在安全关键领域可信地部署人工智能迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

*Xia Yue,Anfeng Liu,Ning Chen,Chenjia Huang,Hui Liu,Zhou Huang,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperTTA是一个统一的框架，旨在增强模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像(HSI)分类模型对由各种真实世界的退化(如噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应)引起的分布变化非常敏感。

Method: 首先，构建一个多重退化高光谱数据集，系统地模拟九种代表性的退化类型，为鲁棒分类评估提供一个全面的基准。基于此，设计了一个具有多层次感受野机制和标签平滑正则化的光谱-空间transformer分类器(SSTC)，以共同捕获多尺度空间上下文并提高泛化能力。此外，HyperTTA还包含一个轻量级的测试时自适应(TTA)策略，即置信度感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)，它仅通过最小化高置信度未标记目标样本的预测熵来更新LayerNorm层的仿射参数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景中优于现有的基线，验证了其分类骨干和所提出的TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA在各种退化场景中优于现有的基线，验证了其分类骨干和所提出的TTA方案的有效性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

### [62] [Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models for Conditional Cortical Thickness Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08442)
*Ivan Stoyanov,Fabian Bongratz,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的预测个体化、高分辨率皮质厚度 (CTh) 轨迹的方法，对于检测皮质的细微变化至关重要，可以深入了解神经退行性过程，并促进更早、更精确的干预策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化、高分辨率的皮质厚度 (CTh) 轨迹对于检测细微的皮质变化至关重要，但由于大脑皮层复杂的非欧几里德几何结构以及整合多模态数据进行特定于受试者的预测的需求，CTh 预测是一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了球面布朗桥扩散模型 (SBDM)。具体来说，我们提出了一种双向条件布朗桥扩散过程，以预测已注册皮质表面的顶点水平的 CTh 轨迹。我们的技术贡献包括一个新的去噪模型，即条件球面 U-Net (CoS-UNet)，它结合了球面卷积和密集交叉注意力，以无缝地整合皮质表面和表格条件。

Result: 与以前的方法相比，SBDM 实现了显着降低的预测误差，正如我们基于 ADNI 和 OASIS 的纵向数据集的实验所证明的那样。

Conclusion: 此外，我们证明了 SBDM 生成个体事实和反事实 CTh 轨迹的能力，为探索皮质发育的假设情景提供了一个新的框架。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Mamba的视觉模型对SSM模块关注不足，为了探索SSM的潜力。

Method: 在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导出新的离散形式，并分析了累积误差。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，FSSM改进了MambaIR的性能，且没有增加额外的参数，超过了当前的轻量级SR方法，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FSSM通过结合token相关性，提高了原始Mamba模块的性能。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效地提高了对比自监督学习在不平衡数据集上的性能，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的图像分析方法通常是孤立的，并且缺乏透明性和可重复性。

Method: 该论文提出了一个统一的流程，该流程结合了开放词汇检测、可提示分割、文本条件下的图像修复和视觉语言描述。

Result: 该系统在超过90%的情况下生成了可用的mask，准确率高于85%。在高端GPU上，图像修复占总运行时的60%到75%。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个透明、可靠的模式，用于在单个提示后面组装现代视觉和多模态模型，具有清晰的护栏和操作实践，可提高对象替换、场景增强和移除的可靠性。

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

TL;DR: 水下物体检测(UOD)对海洋研究至关重要，但面临许多挑战。本文对UOD的挑战进行了分类，并分析了从传统图像处理到现代方法的发展。此外，我们还探讨了大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)在UOD中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下物体检测在海洋研究、水下机器人和海洋保护等领域至关重要。然而，UOD面临许多挑战，影响了其性能，现有方法未能完全捕捉水下环境的复杂性。

Method: 本文将UOD的挑战分为五个关键领域：图像质量退化、目标相关问题、数据相关挑战、计算和处理约束以及检测方法中的限制。分析了从传统图像处理和物体检测技术到现代方法的发展，并探讨了大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)在UOD中的潜力。

Result: 评述确定了三个关键见解：(i)当前的UOD方法不足以充分解决动态水下环境中图像退化和小物体检测等挑战。(ii)使用LVLM的合成数据生成显示出增强数据集的潜力，但需要进一步改进以确保真实性和适用性。(iii)LVLM在UOD中具有巨大的前景，但它们的实时应用仍未得到充分探索，需要进一步研究优化技术。

Conclusion: 水下物体检测(UOD)面临图像质量退化、目标相关问题、数据相关挑战等挑战，现有方法不足以充分解决这些挑战。LVLM在UOD中具有巨大的前景，但它们的实时应用仍未得到充分探索，需要进一步研究优化技术。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

TL;DR: HuMo: A unified framework for human-centric video generation (HCVG) that addresses the challenges of coordinating heterogeneous modalities by constructing a high-quality dataset and using a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HCVG methods struggle to effectively coordinate heterogeneous modalities due to the scarcity of training data and the difficulty of collaborating sub-tasks like subject preservation and audio-visual sync.

Method: A unified HCVG framework with a high-quality dataset and a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies, including minimal-invasive image injection and a focus-by-predicting strategy for audio-visual sync.

Result: HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks.

Conclusion: HuMo establishes a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

*Garry Yang,Zizhe Chen,Man Hon Wong,Haoyu Lei,Yongqiang Chen,Zhenguo Li,Kaiwen Zhou,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为MESH的基准，用于评估大型视频模型（LVM）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视频模型容易产生幻觉，现有视频幻觉基准依赖于手动分类视频内容，忽略了人类的感知过程。

Method: MESH使用问答框架，包含二元和多项选择题，并采用自下而上的方法，评估基本对象、粗到细的主题特征和主题-动作对。

Result: MESH能够有效地识别视频中的幻觉。LVM在识别基本对象和特征方面表现出色，但在处理细节或对齐多个动作时，更容易产生幻觉。

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个全面有效的方法来识别视频中的幻觉。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

*Eric Slyman,Mehrab Tanjim,Kushal Kafle,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态方法，称为多模态混合贝叶斯提示集成（MMB），以解决MLLM在文本到图像生成任务中的偏差、过度自信和不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在评估文本到图像（TTI）生成系统时存在偏差、过度自信以及在不同图像领域表现不一致的问题，并且传统的prompt集成方法无法有效推广到TTI任务。

Method: 提出了一种新的多模态感知方法，即多模态混合贝叶斯提示集成（MMB）。该方法使用贝叶斯prompt集成方法，并通过图像聚类进行增强，从而使judge可以根据每个样本的视觉特征动态分配prompt权重。

Result: MMB在配对偏好判断中提高了准确性，并大大增强了校准效果，从而更容易衡量judge的真实不确定性。在HPSv2和MJBench两个TTI基准测试中，MMB在与人工注释对齐和跨各种图像内容的校准方面均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了多模态特定策略对于judge校准的重要性，并为可靠的大规模TTI评估提出了有希望的路径。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的植物表型分析方法，利用多角度图像来更准确地预测植物的年龄和叶片数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角方法无法捕捉植物表型特征的全部信息，影响植物健康评估和收获准备预测。

Method: 该方法通过随机选择多个角度的图像，学习视角不变的嵌入。

Result: 该方法在 ACM Multimedia 2025 Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge 的植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计任务中均取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 随机选择不同高度的视角进行实验，为未来的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态模型在医学图像分割领域表现不佳，本文通过语义聚合解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在医学领域面临文本提示和视觉特征之间的语义差距以及由此产生的特征分散问题。

Method: 提出期望最大化（EM）聚合机制和文本引导像素解码器。

Result: 在心脏和眼底数据集上，该方法在多个领域泛化基准测试中优于现有 SOTA 方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种机制的协同作用显著提高了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了GraphTopoNet，一个图学习框架，用于融合异构监督并显式建模不确定性，以提高格陵兰岛冰下床的地图绘制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的格陵兰岛冰下床地图对于海平面预测至关重要，但雷达观测稀疏且不均匀。

Method: 利用表面可观测数据（海拔、速度、质量平衡）构建空间图，并结合梯度特征和多项式趋势，以捕捉局部变异性和广泛结构。采用混合损失，将置信度加权的雷达监督与动态平衡的正则化相结合，以处理数据缺失。

Result: 在三个格陵兰岛次区域的应用中，GraphTopoNet优于插值、卷积和基于图的基线方法，误差最多减少60%，同时保留了精细的冰川特征。

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可行知识，并改善了用于气候预测和政策制定的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在放射治疗计划中，必须准确识别计算机断层扫描 (CT) 或磁共振成像 (MRI) 扫描中的风险器官，以确保它们免受有害辐射。同样，诊断与年龄相关的退行性疾病（如肌肉减少症，包括进行性肌肉体积减少和力量下降）通常基于肌肉质量测量，而肌肉质量测量通常来自医学体积的手动分割。

Method: 本文引入了一种隐式形状先验，用于从稀疏切片手动注释中分割体积，并推广到多器官情况，以及一个简单的框架，用于自动选择信息量最大的切片，以指导和最小化下一次交互。

Result: 实验验证表明该方法在两种医学用例中的有效性：在脑癌患者风险器官的背景下进行辅助分割，以及加速创建具有肌肉减少症患者未见肌肉形状的新数据库。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地减少了医学专业人员在复杂 3D 分割任务中的手动工作量。

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Method: 提出了一个具有轻量级三阶段EfficientRWKV骨干的新型EfficientIML模型。EfficientRWKV的混合状态空间和注意力网络并行捕获全局上下文和局部细节，而多尺度监督策略则在分层预测之间强制执行一致性。

Result: 在作者提出的数据集和标准基准测试中进行的大量评估表明，该方法在定位性能、FLOPs和推理速度方面优于基于ViT的和其它SOTA轻量级基线。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于实时取证应用。

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Result: 在12个不同的数据集上进行的实验表明，CLAPS的性能与专家模型相当，并在大多数指标上超过了现有基准。

Conclusion: CLAPS展示了其作为基础模型的广泛通用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Result: 在28个关键类别的9个不同数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该框架优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的非配对多模态学习框架，可以提高眼科疾病诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，需要大量的重新训练或昂贵的配对数据。

Method: 提出Latent Aligned Diffusion Bridges (LADB)，该框架集成了预训练的源域扩散模型和一个目标域的Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM)，后者在部分配对的潜在表示上进行训练。

Result: 在部分监督下的深度图到图像转换任务中表现出卓越的性能。LADB还可以处理多源转换和多目标转换。

Conclusion: LADB是一种可扩展且通用的解决方案，适用于实际的领域转换，尤其是在数据注释成本高昂或不完整的情况下。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过其双参考、双流架构和几何驱动的融合机制，有效地提高了孤立手语识别的准确率，同时减少了模型参数。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the

Method: 使用 Fractal Deformation Network (FDN)，一种受分形几何和自相似性启发的递归编码器-解码器，通过重复的编码器-解码器嵌套和跳跃连接来捕获细粒度细节和长程运动模式。训练目标基于使用总变差 (TV) 正则化的经典变分公式，结合 L1 和 L2 数据保真度项以及 TV 项。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，FractalPINN-Flow 产生准确、平滑和边缘保持的光流场。

Conclusion: 该模型对于高分辨率数据和注释有限的场景特别有效。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Robust U-Net 的系统鲁棒增强框架，用于改进沿海水域分割，该框架利用 HSV 颜色空间监督和多模态约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于 RGB 的方法在不同的海洋环境中经常遭受训练不稳定和泛化性差的问题。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 该方法集成了五个协同组件：HSV 引导的颜色监督、基于梯度的海岸线优化、形态学后处理、海域清理和连通性控制。

Result: 消融研究表明，HSV 监督的影响最大（0.85 影响评分），而完整的框架实现了卓越的训练稳定性（84% 的方差减少）和增强的分割质量。该方法在多个评估指标上显示出持续的改进，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 Robust U-Net 框架能够有效提高沿海水域分割的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges
due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns.
Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a
systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that
leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved
coastal water segmentation. Our approach integrates five synergistic
components: HSV-guided color supervision, gradient-based coastline
optimization, morphological post-processing, sea area cleanup, and connectivity
control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent
improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational
efficiency. For reproducibility, our training configurations and code are

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV
systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high
dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare
mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth
estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By
analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,
and efficiency in real-world scenarios, such as autonomous navigation,

Motivation: 为了解决多模态大语言模型在资源受限环境中部署的挑战，并提高能源效率、计算可扩展性和环境可持续性。

Method: 提出了一种名为BcQLM的轻量级视觉-语言框架，该框架以BreezeCLIP为核心，这是一个紧凑而强大的视觉-语言编码器。

Result: 该模型仅有12亿参数，显著降低了计算成本，同时实现了与标准尺寸MLLM相当的性能。在多个数据集上进行的实验验证了其在准确性和效率之间取得的平衡。

Conclusion: BcQLM为在实际硬件约束下部署MLLM提供了一条有希望的途径。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的端到端人群检测方法，该方法利用对象密度信息来增强现有的基于transformer的检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度图定义通常依赖于头部位置或基于对象的空间统计。本文将这些定义扩展到包括单个边界框维度。

Method: 本文提出了CrowdQuery (CQ)，其核心组件是CQ模块，该模块预测并随后嵌入对象密度图。然后将嵌入的密度信息系统地集成到解码器中。

Result: 在2D和3D域的STCrowd数据集上的实验表明，与基本模型相比，性能显着提高，优于大多数最先进的方法。当集成到最先进的人群检测器中时，CQ可以进一步提高具有挑战性的CrowdHuman数据集的性能，证明了其通用性。

Conclusion: CQ普遍适用于2D和3D检测，无需额外数据。因此，我们是第一个设计出有效桥接拥挤环境中2D和3D检测的方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgoTweak: a dataset for self-verifying HD maps with realistic map priors, addressing the sim2real gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic priors, creating inconsistencies and a sim2real gap due to the lack of a public dataset with prior maps, current maps, and sensor data.

Method: Introduces ArgoTweak, a dataset employing a bijective mapping framework that breaks down large-scale modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level.

Result: Training models on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Ablations highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations.

Conclusion: ArgoTweak establishes a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping, advancing scalable, self-improving mapping solutions.

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习的砷中毒诊断框架，该框架使用手机拍摄的皮肤图像进行诊断，并在农村地区具有应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 砷中毒是南亚和东南亚一个严重的公共卫生问题，但早期皮肤表现通常被低估。自动化的图像诊断解决方案可以支持早期检测和及时干预。

Method: 本研究使用包含超过11000张图像的数据集，对多种深度学习架构（包括CNN和Transformer模型）进行了基准测试，并使用LIME和Grad-CAM实现了模型的可解释性，并通过一个基于Web的诊断工具展示了部署可行性。

Result: 基于Transformer的模型明显优于CNN，其中Swin Transformer取得了最佳结果（86\%的准确率）。LIME和Grad-CAM可视化证实，该模型关注病变相关区域。该框架在外部验证样本上也表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了深度学习在基于移动设备获取的图像进行无创、可访问和可解释的砷中毒诊断方面的潜力。通过实现可靠的图像筛查，它可以作为农村和资源有限社区的实用诊断辅助工具。

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究难以确定真实数据的精确地面实况，本研究旨在分析事件相机星跟踪系统的精度。

Method: 通过将事件相机固定并通过地面望远镜指向夜空，利用地球自转作为参照，将事件流处理为姿态估计，并与国际地球自转和参考系统（IERS）的测量结果进行比较。

Result: 事件相机系统实现了18.47角秒的均方根误差和78.84角秒的误差。

Conclusion: 该精度水平结合事件相机相对于传统传感器的其他优势（例如，由于数据流更稀疏而减少的计算量，更高的动态范围，更低的能耗，更快的更新速率），表明事件相机可用于低成本和低延迟的星跟踪。

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集图像匹配方法在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强烈放大等情况下，由于相邻源位置的对应关系通常分布广泛，因此每个尺度上每个源位置预测单个对应假设可能会导致错误的匹配。

Method: 提出了一种波束搜索策略，以在每个尺度上传播多个假设，并将这些多个假设集成到交叉注意力层中，从而产生一种名为BEAMER的新型密集匹配架构。

Result: BEAMER学会了在不同尺度上保留和传播多个假设，使其比现有技术更鲁棒，尤其是在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强烈放大时。

Conclusion: BEAMER在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强烈放大时，比现有技术更鲁棒。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Motivation: 现有的数据集主要集中在生成图像上，缺乏对视频时空复杂性的关注。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了 GeneVA 数据集。

Method: 构建了一个大规模的包含丰富人工注释的伪影数据集，专注于自然文本提示生成的视频中的时空伪影。

Result: GeneVA 数据集可以用来评估模型性能，并提高生成视频的质量。

Conclusion: GeneVA 填补了文本驱动视频生成领域benchmark的空白， 能够帮助改进生成视频质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的奖励建模框架 RewardDance，通过将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测“yes”token 的概率，解决了视觉生成中奖励模型（RM）扩展范式的问题，并缓解了奖励利用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 CLIP 的 RM 受限于架构和输入模态约束，而流行的 Bradley-Terry 损失与视觉语言模型 (VLM) 的 next-token 预测机制不一致，阻碍了有效扩展。此外，RLHF 优化过程受到奖励利用问题的困扰。

Method: 将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测“yes”token 的概率，表明生成的图像根据特定标准优于参考图像。

Result: 在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成方面显著超过了最先进的方法，并解决了“奖励利用”的挑战。

Conclusion: RewardDance 框架能够扩展 RM 并保持较高的奖励方差，从而产生多样化、高质量的输出，并缓解了困扰较小模型的模式崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅使用单个单眼 RGB 视频序列作为输入，对织物执行 3D 几何重建和外观估计任务。

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Conclusion: 强化学习是训练深度研究智能体的有效方法，能够克服现有方法的局限性，并减少对人类先验的依赖。

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Motivation: 为了优化卫星的数据收集，只包含最重要或信息量最大的测量数据。

Method: 提出了两种基于学习的动态目标方法：强化学习和模仿学习。这些学习方法建立在动态规划解决方案的基础上，以规划一系列采样位置。

Result: 模仿学习的性能平均比最佳启发式方法好 10.0%，而强化学习的性能平均好 13.7%。

Conclusion: 这两种学习方法都可以用相对少量的数据进行有效训练，证明了使用学习方法进行动态目标应用的优势。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnvX turns GitHub repos into intelligent agents for easier reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current software reuse is manual and inefficient.

Method: EnvX uses Agentic AI to create autonomous agents from repos with a three-phase process: initialization, automation, and agent collaboration.

Result: EnvX achieves 74.07% execution completion and 51.85% task pass rate on GitTaskBench, outperforming existing frameworks.

Conclusion: EnvX transforms passive code resources into intelligent agents, improving open-source accessibility and collaboration.

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

### [96] [Trust Semantics Distillation for Collaborator Selection via Memory-Augmented Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08151)
*Botao Zhu,Jeslyn Wang,Dusit Niyato,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型AI模型（LAM）驱动的师生代理架构的任务特定信任语义提炼（2TSD）模型，以减少协作设备选择过程中的开销并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂计算任务中，评估潜在协作设备的信任度至关重要。频繁的数据交换、复杂的推理和动态变化会导致显著的开销和信任评估的恶化。

Method: 构建了一个基于大型AI模型的师生代理架构，教师代理部署在服务器上，负责收集多维信任相关数据，提取任务特定的信任语义，并进行任务-协作方匹配分析。教师代理将信任语义传递给设备端的学生代理，从而实现快速准确的协作方选择。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的2TSD模型可以减少协作方评估时间，降低设备资源消耗，并提高协作方选择的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的信任评估方法，通过任务特定信任语义提炼模型，降低了协作设备选择过程中的开销，提高了准确性。

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Wei-jin Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为ExRAP的框架，用于解决具身智能体在动态、非平稳环境中持续执行指令的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在具身推理方面存在不足，无法很好地适应时变环境。

Method: 该框架通过高效探索环境并建立环境上下文记忆来增强llm的具身推理能力，从而有效地将任务规划过程置于随时间变化的环境上下文中。该框架还结合了基于信息的探索和时间一致性细化方案。

Result: 在VirtualHome、ALFRED和CARLA等环境中的实验表明，该方法在目标成功率和执行效率方面均优于其他基于llm的任务规划方法。

Conclusion: ExRAP框架能够有效地解决具身智能体在动态、非平稳环境中持续执行指令的任务，并且具有较强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护个人音乐版权的需求日益增长。

Method: 开发了一个音乐片段转录系统，可以从音频记录中提取有意义的音乐片段，并计算基于多种音乐特征的相似度得分。

Result: 该方法在音乐抄袭检测实验中表现出良好的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法可以应用于现实世界的音乐场景，并且公开了相似音乐对数据集。

Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR
technologies. We developed a music segment transcription system that extracts
musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive
musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music
plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现电信领域 L4 级自治网络 (AN) 的演进，网络必须超越被动自动化，实现真正的认知能力。

Method: 通过在功能认知系统中实施 Joseph Sifakis 的 AN Agent 参考架构，并部署由混合知识表示驱动的协调主动-反应运行时。

Result: 在 5G NR sub-6 GHz 中实现了亚 10 毫秒的实时控制，下行链路吞吐量比 OLLA 算法高 6%，并通过动态 MCS 优化，将超可靠服务的 BLER 降低了 67%。

Conclusion: 这些改进证实了该架构在克服传统自治障碍和推进 L4 关键能力方面的可行性。

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Co-Investigator AI的代理框架，旨在提高可疑活动报告（SAR）的生成效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在反洗钱（AML）工作流程中，生成符合监管要求的可疑活动报告（SAR）是一个高成本、低可扩展性的瓶颈。大型语言模型（LLM）虽然具有良好的流畅性，但存在事实幻觉、犯罪类型一致性有限和可解释性差的问题。

Method: 该方法集成了专门的代理，用于规划、犯罪类型检测、外部情报收集和合规性验证。该系统具有动态内存管理、用于敏感数据处理的AI隐私保护层以及采用Agent-as-a-Judge范例的实时验证代理，以确保持续的叙述质量保证。

Result: 该系统能够显著加快SAR的起草速度，提高准确性，并使合规团队能够专注于更高阶的分析工作。

Conclusion: Co-Investigator AI标志着合规报告新时代的开始，将AI代理的变革性优势带入监管流程的核心，并为可扩展、可靠和透明的SAR生成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为“以思想为中心的偏好优化”（TCPO）的方法，用于提高具身人工智能中视觉语言模型（VLM）的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在具身任务中存在泛化能力不足、对动态环境反应迟缓以及幻觉问题。强化学习和CoT方法存在样本效率低、一致性差和模型退化的问题。

Method: TCPO方法通过逐步偏好优化，将稀疏奖励信号转化为更丰富的样本对，并引入行动策略一致性约束（APC）来提高模型输出的一致性。

Result: 在ALFWorld环境中的实验表明，TCPO的平均成功率达到26.67%，比RL4VLM提高了6%。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，将基于偏好的学习技术与CoT过程相结合，可以有效提高视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用LLM作为评判来评估其他LLM的复杂决策时，需要监控评判者。当无法信任专家并且不知道他们决策的ground truth时，无限的监控链是不可避免的。通过利用不一致专家之间的逻辑一致性，可以减少评估的不确定性。通过观察LLM评判者在评估其他LLM时的意见一致和不一致之处，可以计算出他们评分能力的唯一可能的评估结果。当两个LLM评判者对第三个LLM完成的任务的正确性存在分歧时，他们不能同时100%正确。这种逻辑可以形式化为一个线性规划问题，用于在任何有限测试中计算整数响应计数。该方法被用于开发针对不一致LLM评判者的no-knowledge 警报。该警报可以检测到，在没有误报的情况下，评判者集合中至少有一个或多个成员违反了用户指定的评分能力要求。

Motivation: 在利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为评判来评估其他LLM的复杂决策时，由于缺乏ground truth和对专家的不信任，需要解决如何监控评判者的问题。

Method: 通过观察LLM评判者在评估其他LLM时的意见一致和不一致之处，并利用不一致专家之间的逻辑一致性，将评估问题形式化为一个线性规划问题。

Result: 开发出了一种no-knowledge 警报，可以在没有误报的情况下检测到LLM评判者集合中违反用户指定的评分能力要求的成员。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种利用逻辑一致性来监控LLM评判者的方法，并开发了no-knowledge 警报来检测不一致的评判者。

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Motivation: 现有MAS故障诊断工具依赖统计相关性，在复杂任务中准确率低，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 1) 性能因果反演原理，通过反转执行日志中的数据流来建模性能依赖关系，并使用Shapley值进行agent级责任分配；2) 新的因果发现算法CDC-MAS，通过处理MAS交互数据的非平稳性来稳健地识别关键故障步骤。

Result: 在Who&When和TRAIL基准测试中，步级准确率达到36.2%，优化后任务成功率平均提高22.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为调试复杂agent交互提供了一种有效方案，为更可靠和可解释的MAS铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 该研究验证了该架构在典型的错误信念任务上的有效性，并系统地探索了其复制与双重过程理论相关的标志性认知偏差（包括锚定、认知负荷疲劳、框架效应和启动效应）的能力

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Conclusion: 该实现为研究不同的叙事框架如何影响基于奖励的决策，以及探索基于优化的学习和 AI 系统中的符号推理之间的潜在交互奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构在管理异构和分布式数据方面面临挑战，多语言持久化是一种解决方案。

Method: 本文结合理论概念、实际案例和标准数据库平台的基准测试，采用比较框架评估了关系型数据库、文档数据库、键值数据库、列族数据库和图数据库。

Result: 研究表明，多语言持久化提高了适应性、性能和领域对齐，但也增加了治理和运营的复杂性。

Conclusion: 为了应对这些权衡，本文讨论了 Saga 工作流、事件溯源和 Outbox 集成等架构模式。

Abstract: Microservices architectures have become the foundation for developing
scalable and modern software systems, but they also bring significant
challenges in managing heterogeneous and distributed data. The pragmatic
solution is polyglot persistence, the deliberate use of several different
database technologies adapted to a given microservice requirement - is one such
strategy. This paper examines polyglot persistence in microservice based
systems. This paper brings together theoretical concepts with evidence from
practical implementations and comparative benchmarks of standard database
platforms. A comparative framework is applied to relational, document,
key-value, column-family and graph databases to assess scalability,
consistency, query expressiveness, operational overhead and integration ease.
Empirical data drawn from industry case studies such as Netflix, Uber, and
Shopify, and survey data illustrate real-life adoption trends and challenges.
These findings demonstrate that polyglot persistence increases adaptability ,
performance , domain alignment but also governance or operational complexity.
To cope with such trade-offs, architectural patterns such as saga workflows,
event sourcing, and outbox integration are discussed.

*Leilei Du,Peng Cheng,Lei Chen,Heng Tao Shen,Xuemin Lin,Wei Xi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper proposes a personalized w-event privacy protection method for data stream estimation, allowing different users to have different privacy requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing w-event privacy studies on infinite data streams only focus on homogeneous privacy requirements for all users, but this paper aims to address the need for personalized privacy requirements.

Method: The paper designs a Personalized Window Size Mechanism (PWSM) and proposes two solutions: Personalized Budget Distribution (PBD) and Personalized Budget Absorption (PBA) to achieve personalized differential privacy.

Result: PBD and PBA outperform state-of-the-art private stream estimation methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. PBD achieves 68% less error than BD on average on real data sets, and PBA achieves 24.9% less error than BA on average on synthetic data sets.

Conclusion: The proposed PBD and PBA methods are efficient and effective in providing personalized w-event privacy protection for stream data estimation.

Abstract: Streaming data collection is indispensable for stream data analysis, such as
event monitoring. However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy
leaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy
within a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.
Most existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on
homogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose
personalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have
different privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,
we design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy
requirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism
(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data
statistics while achieving $w$-event level $\epsilon$ personalized differential
privacy ( ($w$, $\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution
(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the
same privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the
previous release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$
time slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time
slots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that
both PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation
methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic
data sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget
Distribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error
than BD on average on real data sets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24.9% less
error than BA on average on synthetic data sets.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为稀疏倒排非冗余距离索引（SINDI）的算法，用于解决检索增强生成（RAG）中稀疏向量最大内积搜索（MIPS）的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在生产环境中受限于冗余距离计算和频繁的随机内存访问，且稀疏向量的压缩存储格式阻碍了SIMD加速的使用。

Method: SINDI 包含三个关键优化：(i) 高效内积计算，利用 SIMD 加速并消除冗余标识符查找，实现批量内积计算；(ii) 内存友好设计，用对倒排列表的顺序访问代替对原始向量的随机内存访问；(iii) 向量剪枝，仅保留向量的高幅值非零条目。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，SINDI 在不同规模、语言和模型的数据集上实现了最先进的性能。在 MsMarco 数据集上，当 Recall@50 超过 99% 时，SINDI 提供的单线程每秒查询数 (QPS) 比 SEISMIC 和 PyANNs 提高了 4.2 到 26.4 倍。

Conclusion: SINDI 已被集成到蚂蚁集团的开源向量搜索库 VSAG 中。

Abstract: Sparse vector Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is crucial in multi-path
retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Recent inverted index-based
and graph-based algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical
efficiency. However, their performance in production environments is often
limited by redundant distance computations and frequent random memory accesses.
Furthermore, the compressed storage format of sparse vectors hinders the use of
SIMD acceleration. In this paper, we propose the sparse inverted non-redundant
distance index (SINDI), which incorporates three key optimizations: (i)
Efficient Inner Product Computation: SINDI leverages SIMD acceleration and
eliminates redundant identifier lookups, enabling batched inner product
computation; (ii) Memory-Friendly Design: SINDI replaces random memory accesses
to original vectors with sequential accesses to inverted lists, substantially
reducing memory-bound latency. (iii) Vector Pruning: SINDI retains only the
high-magnitude non-zero entries of vectors, improving query throughput while
maintaining accuracy. We evaluate SINDI on multiple real-world datasets.
Experimental results show that SINDI achieves state-of-the-art performance
across datasets of varying scales, languages, and models. On the MsMarco
dataset, when Recall@50 exceeds 99%, SINDI delivers single-thread
query-per-second (QPS) improvements ranging from 4.2 to 26.4 times compared
with SEISMIC and PyANNs. Notably, SINDI has been integrated into Ant Group's
open-source vector search library, VSAG.

Motivation: 在知识库相似性评估中，经典方法无法处理矛盾，因此需要一个更鲁棒和可解释的相似性度量。

Method: 引入了一种新的度量 $ S^* $，它惩罚不一致性，同时奖励共享属性。定义了 paraconsistent 超类别 $ \Xi_K^* $ 以分层组织知识实体。该模型还包括一个矛盾提取器 $ E $ 和一个修复机制。

Result: 理论结果保证了 $ S^* $ 的自反性、对称性和有界性。

Conclusion: 该方法为管理冲突知识提供了一个有希望的解决方案，并在多智能体系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: This article proposes a paraconsistent framework for evaluating similarity in
knowledge bases. Unlike classical approaches, this framework explicitly
integrates contradictions, enabling a more robust and interpretable similarity
measure. A new measure $ S^* $ is introduced, which penalizes inconsistencies
while rewarding shared properties. Paraconsistent super-categories $ \Xi_K^* $
are defined to hierarchically organize knowledge entities. The model also
includes a contradiction extractor $ E $ and a repair mechanism, ensuring
consistency in the evaluations. Theoretical results guarantee reflexivity,
symmetry, and boundedness of $ S^* $. This approach offers a promising solution
for managing conflicting knowledge, with perspectives in multi-agent systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界分析环境中的SQL查询经常出现语法错误、效率低下或语义不对齐的问题，尤其是在复杂的OLAP场景中。

Method: SQLGovernor引入了一种片段式处理策略，以实现细粒度的重写和局部错误纠正，并结合了由专家反馈指导的混合自学习机制。

Result: 在BIRD和BIRD CRITIC等基准以及工业数据集上的实验表明，SQLGovernor始终将基本模型的性能提高多达10%，同时最大限度地减少了对手动专业知识的依赖。

Conclusion: SQLGovernor在生产环境中部署，展示了强大的实用性和有效的性能。

Abstract: SQL queries in real world analytical environments, whether written by humans
or generated automatically often suffer from syntax errors, inefficiency, or
semantic misalignment, especially in complex OLAP scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies
multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query
modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework
enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise
processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error
correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further
incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback,
allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and
rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as
well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the
performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual
expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong
practical utility and effective performance.

Motivation: 研究动机是计算机科学文本包含丰富的叙述内容和图表，而如何有效利用这些多模态信息是一个挑战。

Method: 使用超过3600页的计算机科学教科书页面和一个视觉语言模型（VLM），生成多向量表示，捕捉文本和视觉语义，并存储在向量数据库中。使用75个自然语言查询进行基准测试，比较不同相似度度量下的检索性能。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为数字图书馆的发现提供设计见解，讨论了使用向量数据库和多模态嵌入进行信息检索的实用性，并揭示了该方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Computer science texts are particularly rich in both narrative content and
illustrative charts, algorithms, images, annotated diagrams, etc. This study
explores the extent to which vector-based multimodal retrieval, powered by
vision-language models (VLMs), can improve discovery across multi-modal (text
and images) content. Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from
computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate
multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These
embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural
language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across
four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the
strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity
most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further
discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding
for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design
insights for discovery over digital libraries.

Motivation: 推荐系统领域的研究大多在有限的时间跨度内评估系统，而用户行为可能会随着时间的推移而演变。尽管媒体研究和心理学提供了丰富的关于个体年龄增长时用户偏好和行为演变的研究，但在用户建模和推荐系统领域，这方面的研究却很少。

Method: 使用 LFM-2b 数据集，该数据集包含足够长的时间范围以允许真正的纵向研究，并包括有关其用户的年龄信息。

Result: 研究发现，特定的使用和品味偏好与用户的年龄直接相关，例如，年轻用户倾向于广泛收听当代流行音乐，而年长的用户则有更精致和个性化的收听习惯。

Conclusion: 研究结果为推荐系统领域的研究开辟了新的方向，为未来的工作提供了指导。

Abstract: The majority of research in recommender systems, be it algorithmic
improvements, context-awareness, explainability, or other areas, evaluates
these systems on datasets that capture user interaction over a relatively
limited time span. However, recommender systems can very well be used
continuously for extended time. Similarly so, user behavior may evolve over
that extended time. Although media studies and psychology offer a wealth of
research on the evolution of user preferences and behavior as individuals age,
there has been scant research in this regard within the realm of user modeling
and recommender systems. In this study, we investigate the evolution of user
preferences and behavior using the LFM-2b dataset, which, to our knowledge, is
the only dataset that encompasses a sufficiently extensive time frame to permit
real longitudinal studies and includes age information about its users. We
identify specific usage and taste preferences directly related to the age of
the user, i.e., while younger users tend to listen broadly to contemporary
popular music, older users have more elaborate and personalized listening
habits. The findings yield important insights that open new directions for
research in recommender systems, providing guidance for future efforts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于 deepfake 检测的持续学习框架，可以适应新的 visual manipulation 技术，同时保留对过去生成器的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非持续学习的 deepfake 检测方法需要频繁且昂贵的重新训练，无法适应 deepfake 生成技术的快速发展。

Method: 该框架模拟了 deepfake 技术在 7 年内的真实演变过程，并构建在轻量级视觉主干之上，以实现 DFD 系统的实时性能。同时，论文还提出了两个新的指标：C-AUC 和 FWT-AUC。

Result: 实验表明，该框架可以高效地适应新的 deepfake 技术（比完全重新训练快 155 倍），并能稳健地保留历史知识。然而，由于每个现有生成器都具有独特的特征，因此当前方法在没有额外训练的情况下，对未来生成器的泛化能力仍然接近随机水平 (FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5)。

Conclusion: 观察结果构成了新提出的非通用 Deepfake 分布假设的基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨了未经授权的数据用于模型训练对数据所有者利益的损害，以及现有不可学习方法在跨任务场景下的不足。

Method: 通过观察干净模型和中毒模型在简单模型架构下的收敛过程差异，从损失景观的角度分析不可学习性的原因，并提出 Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) 来量化参数的不可学习性。

Result: 发现只有一部分关键参数优化路径显示出显著差异，暗示损失景观与不可学习性之间存在密切关系。提出了 Unlearnable Distance (UD) 来衡量数据的不可学习性。

Conclusion: 旨在通过提出的 UD 对主流不可学习方法进行基准测试，以提高社区对现有不可学习方法能力边界的认识。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Conclusion: Entity linking is a fundamental task in NLP with various use cases, particularly in news analytics, where it bridges unstructured text with knowledge graphs.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm

understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in

prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

Result: 提出的Krum+防御方法成功抵御了新的自适应攻击和现有攻击。

Conclusion: 本文提出的防御方法在联邦学习中针对后门攻击具有有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Motivation: Limited labeled ECG data hinders AI-based diagnosis.

Method: Integrates ECG physiological similarity cues into contrastive learning with ECG-specific augmentations and a hybrid loss function.

Result: PhysioCLR boosts mean AUROC by 12% compared to baselines on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Physiology-informed SSL enhances ECG feature learning, improving label-efficient diagnostics.

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Result: 实验结果表明，上下文学习可以通过适应类似的风险模式来提高预测精度。此外，上下文学习还允许模型推广到新的实例。

Conclusion: 本文提出的上下文学习机制可以有效提高预测精度，并使模型能够推广到新的实例。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个利用大型语言模型（LLM）和多模型机器学习（ML）架构来预测罕见、高影响力结果的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险投资（VC）领域，投资者必须评估具有有限和嘈杂的早期数据的创业公司。

Method: 该方法结合了黑盒模型的预测能力和可靠决策所需的可解释性。我们使用LLM驱动的特征工程从非结构化数据中提取和合成复杂信号，然后在包括XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归的分层模型集成中处理这些信号。该集成首先产生成功可能性的连续估计，然后对其进行阈值处理以产生二元稀有事件预测。

Result: 实证结果表明，该模型在三个独立的测试子集中实现了9.8倍至11.1倍于随机分类器基线的精度。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性分析进一步揭示了可解释的成功驱动因素：创业公司的类别列表占预测影响的15.6%，其次是创始人数量，而教育水平和领域专业知识的贡献较小但稳定。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mmm-fair是一个开源工具包，它利用基于boosting的集成方法动态优化模型权重，以最大限度地减少分类错误和不同的公平性违规行为，从而实现灵活的多目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公平感知分类中，平衡性能和公平性至关重要，而交叉偏见加剧了这一挑战。相互冲突的公平性定义使任务更加复杂，难以找到普遍公平的解决方案。尽管对公平AI的监管和社会需求不断增长，但流行的工具包对探索多维公平性和相关权衡的支持有限。

Method: mmm-fair利用基于boosting的集成方法，动态优化模型权重，以共同最小化分类错误和不同的公平性违规行为，从而实现灵活的多目标优化。

Result: 该系统使用户能够部署符合其特定背景需求的模型，同时可靠地发现最先进方法经常遗漏的交叉偏见。

Conclusion: mmm-fair独特地结合了深入的多属性公平性、多目标优化、无代码的基于聊天的界面、LLM驱动的解释、用于模型选择的交互式Pareto探索、自定义公平约束定义以及部署就绪的模型，这种组合在现有的公平性工具中很少见。

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

*Ho Ming Lee,Katrien Antonio,Benjamin Avanzi,Lorenzo Marchi,Rui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个距离协方差正则化框架，以减轻模型预测和受保护属性之间的关联，从而在回归和分类任务中实现公平性，并解决公平性选区划分问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，跨受保护属性（如性别或种族）确保公平性至关重要。现有的文献主要集中在二元分类上，但回归任务中的公平性同样重要。此外，反歧视法也适用于连续属性，例如年龄，但许多现有方法并不适用。在实践中，可能同时存在多个受保护的属性；但是，针对多个属性的公平性方法通常会忽略所谓的“公平性选区划分”，从而忽略了交叉子群体（例如，非裔美国女性或西班牙裔男性）之间的差异。

Method: 本文提出了一种距离协方差正则化框架，该框架减轻了模型预测和受保护属性之间的关联，符合人口统计均等的公平性定义，并捕获了线性和非线性依赖性。为了增强在存在多个受保护属性时的适用性，我们通过结合两种基于距离协方差的多元依赖性度量来扩展我们的框架：先前提出的联合距离协方差 (JdCov) 和我们新颖的串联距离协方差 (CCdCov)，它们有效地解决了回归和分类任务中的公平性选区划分问题，这些任务涉及各种类型的受保护属性。

Result: 我们将我们的框架应用于 COMPAS 再犯数据集和一个大型汽车保险索赔数据集。

Conclusion: 我们讨论并说明了如何校准正则化强度，包括一种基于 Jensen-Shannon 散度的方法，该方法量化了跨组预测分布的差异。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MARLINE的新方法，用于解决在线学习中的概念漂移问题，即使源概念和目标概念不匹配，也能利用来自多个数据源的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据流挖掘系统中概念漂移对预测性能的影响，现有方法假设至少一个源模型代表与目标概念相似的概念，但在许多实际场景中可能不成立。

Method: 通过将目标概念投影到每个源概念的空间，使多个源子分类器能够作为集成的一部分，为目标概念的预测做出贡献。

Result: 在多个合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MARLINE比几种最先进的数据流学习方法更准确。

Conclusion: MARLINE方法在非平稳环境中可以有效地利用来自多个数据源的知识，即使源概念和目标概念不匹配。

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Abstract: The Domain Mixed Unit (DMU) is a new neural arithmetic unit that learns a
single parameter gate that mixes between log-space and linear-space
representations while performing either addition (DMU add) or subtraction (DMU

state-of-the-art performance on the NALM Benchmark, a dataset designed to test
the ability of neural arithmetic units to generalize arithmetic operations,
specifically performing with the highest percentage solved over all seeds on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的迁移学习方法，以解决多标签数据流中标签概念漂移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非平稳环境中，多标签数据中的标签概念经常发生漂移，独立或与其他标签相关。在相关标签之间转移知识可以加速适应，但针对数据流的多标签迁移学习研究仍然有限。

Method: BR-MARLENE 利用来自源和目标流中不同标签的知识进行多标签分类;BRPW-MARLENE 通过显式建模和转移成对标签依赖关系来增强学习性能。

Result: 综合实验表明，这两种方法在非平稳环境中优于最先进的多标签流方法。

Conclusion: 证明了标签间知识转移对于提高预测性能的有效性。

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

*Francesco D'Angelo,Francesco Croce,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的框架，展示了transformers动态处理因果结构的能力，通过交错具有不同滞后的马尔可夫链来改变因果结构，揭示了一种新的电路，即选择性归纳头，使transformers能够选择正确的上下文因果结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工作依赖于马尔可夫链来研究归纳头的形成，揭示了transformers如何捕获因果依赖关系，并在上下文中学习转移概率。然而，它们依赖于固定的因果结构，无法捕捉自然语言的复杂性，而自然语言中tokens之间的关系随上下文动态变化。

Method: 本文通过交错具有不同滞后的马尔可夫链来改变因果结构，同时保持转移概率不变。这种设置揭示了选择性归纳头的形成，这是一种新的电路，使transformers能够选择正确的上下文因果结构。

Result: 本文通过实验证明，transformers学习了这种机制，通过识别正确的滞后并从过去复制相应的token来预测下一个token。本文详细构建了一个3层transformer来实现选择性归纳头，并进行了理论分析，证明该机制渐近收敛于最大似然解。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果加深了对transformers如何选择因果结构的理解，为transformers的功能和可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图(EEG)中的伪迹会混淆自动分析，但大规模标记成本高昂。

Method: 使用TUH EEG伪迹语料库，整理了按受试者划分的分割和固定长度的多通道窗口，并针对每种模型定制了预处理。比较了条件WGAN-GP和具有无分类器指导的1D去噪扩散模型。

Result: WGAN-GP在频谱对齐方面表现更好，且与真实数据的MMD更低，但两种模型都表现出较弱的类条件恢复。

Conclusion: 发布了一个可重复的流程，用于建立脑电伪迹合成的基线，并揭示未来工作的可行失败模式。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代降阶模型在解决参数化偏微分方程族问题时，长期预测能力会下降。

Method: 引入了一种灵活、高阶但计算成本较低的有限差分格式，并提出了Rollout损失函数。

Result: 在二维 Burgers 方程上验证了该方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在长期预测中具有优势

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种Prescribe-then-Select (PS)框架，用于解决上下文随机优化(CSO)中的策略选择问题，该框架通过构建候选策略库并学习元策略来选择最佳策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多CSO设置中，来自不同建模范例的多个候选策略在协变量空间中表现出异构性能，没有单一策略能够统一支配。

Method: 该框架首先构建一个可行的候选策略库，然后学习一个元策略来为观察到的协变量选择最佳策略。元策略使用最优策略树的集合来实现，这些树通过训练集上的交叉验证进行训练，从而使策略选择完全由数据驱动。

Result: 在两个基准CSO问题（单阶段报童问题和两阶段货运计划问题）中，PS始终优于协变量空间的异构区域中最佳单一策略，并且在不存在这种异构性时收敛到主导策略。

Conclusion: PS框架在解决上下文随机优化中的策略选择问题上表现出有效性，特别是在候选策略表现出异构性的情况下。

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种结合草图和高斯机制的草图高斯机制（SGM），用于联邦学习中的隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中，通信成本和隐私是两个主要考虑因素。现有的私有联邦学习文献对草图和高斯机制的隐私分析是孤立的。

Method: 本文提出了一种草图高斯机制（SGM），它直接结合了草图和高斯机制来实现隐私保护。使用Rényi-DP工具，对SGM的整体隐私保证进行了联合分析。

Result: 结果表明，对于固定的噪声幅度，SGM的隐私级别与1/sqrt(b)成正比，其中b是草图维度。实验结果表明，在相同的隐私级别下，基于SGM的FL与非草图私有FL变体至少具有竞争力，并且在某些设置中优于它们。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SGM方法在保证隐私的同时，可以有效地降低通信成本，并且通过在服务器端使用自适应优化器，可以进一步提高经验性能。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种自监督 EDD 框架和一种专为 HAR 设计的创新数据增强技术，并通过经验验证了该方法在提高鲁棒性和可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

TL;DR: CRITICAL数据集通过提供来自不同机构的大量患者数据，为临床AI研究开辟了新的前沿。为了充分利用这一资源，我们提出了CRISP，它将原始数据转换为ML-ready数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重症监护EHR数据集（如MIMIC和eICU）促进了临床AI研究的显著进展，但CRITICAL数据集通过提供广泛的规模和多样性开辟了新的前沿。

Method: CRISP通过以下方式将原始OMOP数据转换为ML-ready数据集：(1)透明的数据质量管理，(2)异构医学术语到统一SNOMED-CT标准的交叉词汇映射，(3)具有并行优化的模块化架构，(4)全面的基线模型基准。

Result: CRISP可以在不到一天的时间内处理完整的数据集，并为多个临床预测任务建立可重复的性能标准。

Conclusion: CRISP通过提供处理流程、基线实现和详细的转换文档，节省了研究人员数月的预处理工作，并 democratizes 对大规模多机构重症监护数据的访问，使他们能够专注于推进临床AI。

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种下游任务中表现出令人印象深刻的能力，但通常在微调过程中面临灾难性遗忘（CF）。

Method: 提出了一种名为遗忘感知剪枝度量（FAPM）的新型剪枝方法，该方法使用任务向量与预训练模型参数的比率作为衡量CF的标准，并将其整合到剪枝标准中。

Result: 在八个数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明，FAPM将CF限制在仅0.25％，同时保持了99.67％的下游任务准确率。

Conclusion: FAPM 限制了灾难性遗忘，同时保持了下游任务的准确性，且不需要修改训练过程、模型架构或任何辅助数据。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的框架，用于评估视觉语言模型在 2D 物理学方面的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型对物理等基本科学原理的掌握程度。

Method: 该框架包含一个实用的场景生成器，可以在四个核心领域（抛体运动、碰撞动力学、力学和流体动力学）创建超过 400 个问题的多样化测试平台。

Result: 对四种最先进的视觉语言模型的综合评估表明，模型规模与推理能力之间存在很强的相关性，性能最佳的模型 Qwen2.5-VL-7B 的总分为 0.815。研究发现，虽然模型擅长公式化问题，但它们在需要抽象空间推理的领域中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在促进对视觉语言模型科学推理的研究，并加深对其能力和局限性的了解。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

TL;DR: 越南降雨预报因气候和地理变化而极具挑战性。本文提出了一种基于矩阵配置文件的加权集成 (MPWE) 框架，用于动态捕获多个地理模型预测之间的协变依赖关系，同时结合冗余感知加权来平衡模型之间的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于越南气候条件多样，河流流域地理差异大，准确可靠的降雨预报对于洪水管理、水电运营和灾害准备至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于矩阵配置文件的加权集成 (MPWE) 框架，该框架是一种状态切换框架，可以动态捕获多个地理模型预测之间的协变依赖关系，同时结合冗余感知加权来平衡模型之间的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，与地理模型和集成基线相比，MPWE 在预测误差的平均值和标准差方面始终表现更低，表明跨流域和预测范围的准确性和稳定性均有所提高。

Conclusion: MPWE 是一种有效的方法，可以提高越南降雨预报的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

*Yao Lu,Chunfeng Sun,Dongwei Xu,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FoQuS的方法，通过从原始数据集中选择一个coreset来近似完整训练的效果，从而显著减少训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的自动调制识别(AMR)模型在大型标记数据的支持下取得了显著进展。然而，当开发新模型或执行超参数调优时，使用海量数据重复训练所花费的时间和能源消耗往往是难以忍受的。

Method: FoQuS记录每个样本在全数据集训练过程中的预测轨迹，并在此基础上构建了三个基于训练动态的重要性指标。

Result: 实验表明，FoQuS仅使用原始数据的1%-30%就能在多个AMR数据集上保持较高的识别精度和良好的跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoQuS方法有效降低了训练开销，同时保持了较高的识别精度和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

### [141] [EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08315)
*Bohan Yu,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应的KV缓存压缩框架EvolKV，用于逐层、任务驱动的KV缓存压缩，可以联合优化内存效率和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法通常依赖于启发式方法，例如跨层统一缓存分配或静态驱逐策略，但是它们忽略了层特定特征模式和任务性能之间的关键相互作用，这可能导致泛化性能下降。

Method: 通过将缓存分配重新定义为多目标优化问题，EvolKV利用进化搜索来动态配置层预算，同时直接最大化下游性能。

Result: 在11个任务上的大量实验表明，我们的方法在长上下文任务的各种KV缓存预算下优于所有基线方法，并且在GSM8K上超过启发式基线高达7个百分点。

Conclusion: EvolKV在代码完成方面实现了优于完整KV缓存设置的性能，同时仅利用了原始预算的1.5%，这表明在KV缓存预算分配的学习压缩策略中存在未开发的潜力。

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

*Lukas Toral,Teddy Lazebnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用预训练大型语言模型（LLM）作为强化学习（RL）算法的导师，以加速训练并提高收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法通常需要长时间的训练才能变得有用，尤其是在具有稀疏奖励的复杂环境中。现有的加速训练技术通常非常具体，并且需要开发人员在问题领域的专业知识。

Method: 通过实验评估了LLM生成的指导对RL收敛动态的影响，使用了54种配置，改变了RL算法（DQN、PPO、A2C）、LLM导师（Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek）和环境（Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four）。

Result: LLM辅导显著加速了RL收敛，同时保持了相当的最佳性能。建议重用机制进一步缩短了训练时间，但也导致了不太稳定的收敛动态。

Conclusion: LLM辅导通常可以提高收敛速度，但其有效性对特定任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

*Jiaming Yan,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MoEpic的 MoE 推理系统，该系统通过一种新颖的专家分割机制来缓解 MoE LLM 的 VRAM 需求，并降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模参数对GPU内存提出了很高的要求，阻碍了MoE LLM的广泛应用。将专家参数卸载到 CPU RAM 可以有效缓解 MoE 推理的 VRAM 需求。现有方法通常在 VRAM 中缓存一小部分专家，并在推理过程中从 RAM 动态预取专家，但由于缓存命中率低和专家加载延迟大，导致推理速度显著下降。

Method: MoEpic 将每个专家垂直分为顶部和底部两个部分。MoEpic 缓存热门专家的顶部部分，以便在有限的 VRAM 预算下存储更多专家，从而提高缓存命中率。在每一层的推理过程中，MoEpic 预测并预取下一层激活的专家。由于缓存专家的顶部段无需获取，因此减少了加载时间，从而实现了高效的传输-计算重叠。此外，还提出了一种基于不动点迭代的分而治之算法，用于自适应缓存配置。

Result: 在流行的 MoE LLM 上进行的大量实验表明，与基线相比，MoEpic 可以节省大约一半的 GPU 成本，同时降低大约 37.51%-65.73% 的推理延迟。

Conclusion: MoEpic 是一种高效的 MoE 推理系统，它可以通过专家分割机制和自适应缓存配置来有效降低 VRAM 需求和推理延迟。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

*Haeun Jeon,Hyunglip Bae,Chanyeong Kim,Yongjae Lee,Woo Chang Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，通过预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度，以提高决策质量和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的决策学习（DFL）方法由于损失情况不稳定，收敛性差，而传统的预测学习（PFL）忽略了下游决策质量。

Method: 通过使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构建更新方向，无需额外训练，可与任何DFL求解器集成。

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证了该方法，结果表明，与其他基线方法相比，该方法能够实现更低的遗憾和更稳定的训练。

Conclusion: 该方法在PFL或DFL难以处理的情况下，也能实现更低的遗憾和更稳定的训练。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦学习中更复杂的现实场景：类不平衡联邦免源域适应 (CI-FFREEDA)，并提出用冻结的视觉基础模型 (VFM) 替换 FFREEDA 主干，从而提高整体准确性，而无需进行广泛的参数调整，并降低联邦学习中的计算和通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦免源域适应 (FFREEDA) 研究主要集中在客户端持有的目标域数据保持未标记，并且服务器只能在预训练期间访问源域数据。本文旨在将此框架扩展到更复杂和现实的设置：类不平衡 FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA)，它考虑了源域和目标域中的类不平衡，以及源和目标之间以及目标客户之间的标签偏移。

Method: 本文提出用冻结的视觉基础模型 (VFM) 替换 FFREEDA 主干。

Result: 实验结果表明，VFM 有效地缓解了域差距、类不平衡以及目标客户之间的 non-IID-ness 的影响。

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器，而不是复杂的自适应或 FL 方法，是现实世界 FL 成功的关键。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Cutmax算法，加速同态加密下的LLM文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型中，保护用户隐私至关重要。同态加密可以在加密数据上进行计算，但文本生成的解码方法（如argmax和sampling）计算成本很高。

Method: 提出了HE友好的argmax算法Cutmax，并提出了首个HE兼容的nucleus (top-p) sampling方法。

Result: 与基线相比，延迟降低了24x-35x。

Conclusion: Cutmax算法和新的sampling方法能显著加速安全文本生成，并具有较强的理论保证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为MoT（Mixture-of-Tinkers）的图基础模型，旨在解决图VQ-MAE在多领域泛化中遇到的模型退化和表示崩溃问题。MoT通过信息增强和正则化来改善模型的性能，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型（GFM）在跨任务泛化方面表现良好，但存在领域泛化冲突，导致模型退化和表示崩溃的问题。本文旨在解决这些问题，提高GFM的性能。

Method: 本文提出了MoT模型，它包括两个关键部分：(1) 信息增强，利用边相关的语义融合策略和混合码本与领域相关的路由来提高信息容量；(2) 正则化，利用额外的正则化来改善梯度监督。

Result: 在6个领域22个数据集上的实验表明，MoT在监督、小样本和零样本场景中都取得了显著的改进，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MoT模型能够有效解决图基础模型在多领域泛化中遇到的模型退化和表示崩溃问题，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。MoT具有灵活的架构，并遵循GFM的缩放定律。

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 大型模型的性能取决于训练数据的质量和数量。由于公共索引数据的增长速度跟不上训练数据集的增长速度，未来可能面临数据枯竭。引入Generative Data Refinement (GDR)框架，利用预训练的生成模型将包含不良内容的原始数据集转换为更适合训练的精炼数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练数据不足和数据包含不良内容的问题。希望通过GDR框架，利用用户生成但未公开索引的数据，同时避免隐私泄露和其他不良内容。

Method: 提出Generative Data Refinement (GDR)框架，使用预训练的生成模型转换数据集。

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，并能直接对高风险数据集进行解毒。GDR的精炼输出自然匹配网络规模数据集的多样性。

Conclusion: GDR框架简单有效，可以扩展前沿模型的训练数据总量。

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Motivation: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）处理和推理结构化和非结构化数据的能力，探索VLM在像素化探测器数据中识别微中子相互作用的应用。

Method: 使用微调的LLaMa 3.2的VLM，并与最先进的卷积神经网络（CNN）架构进行基准测试。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

### [151] [An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for General Insurance Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08467)
*Patrick J. Laub,Tu Pho,Bernard Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种可解释的深度学习模型，用于一般保险定价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保险领域，需要一种既有神经网络的预测能力，又能提供完全透明和可解释结果的模型。

Method: 该模型为每个协变量和成对交互项分配一个专用神经网络（或子网络），以独立学习其对建模输出的影响，同时实施各种架构约束以实现基本的可解释性（例如稀疏性）和保险应用中的实际要求（例如平滑性，单调性）。

Result: 在大多数情况下，所提出的模型优于其他方法，同时在其内部逻辑中提供完全的透明性，从而突出了强大的可解释性和预测能力。

Conclusion: 提出的Actuarial Neural Additive Model在预测精度和可解释性方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种名为SHAining的方法，用于量化不同事件日志特征对过程挖掘算法指标的边际贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作缺乏对事件日志特征如何单独影响算法的系统分析，并且忽略了评估指标中重叠的个体特征影响。

Method: 使用过程发现作为下游任务，分析超过22,000个事件日志，涵盖广泛的特征，以揭示哪些特征对算法的影响最大。

Result: 揭示了事件日志特征的值与其贡献影响之间的相关性，评估了算法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供关于事件日志特征如何影响过程挖掘算法指标的新颖见解。

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

### [153] [Merge-of-Thought Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08814)
*Zhanming Shen,Zeyu Qin,Zenan Huang,Hao Chen,Jiaqi Hu,Yihong Zhuang,Guoshan Lu,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) 的轻量级框架，用于从多个教师模型中提炼知识到学生模型中，该框架交替进行特定于教师的监督微调和学生变体的权重空间合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设只有一个最佳教师，但实际上存在多个候选教师，且不同学生有不同的最佳教师，即使是同一学生，最佳教师也可能因数据集而异。

Method: MoT框架交替进行特定于教师的监督微调分支和由此产生的学生变体的权重空间合并，以统一多个教师的推理能力，克服教师之间的冲突。

Result: 在竞赛数学基准测试中，仅使用约200个高质量CoT样本，将MoT应用于Qwen3-14B学生模型，超越了DEEPSEEK-R1、QWEN3-30B-A3B、QWEN3-32B和OPENAI-O1等强大模型。

Conclusion: MoT是一种简单、可扩展的途径，可以有效地将来自不同教师的长CoT能力提炼到紧凑的学生模型中，同时减少灾难性遗忘，并提高数学之外的一般推理能力。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Motivation: 研究带有指数衰减记忆的Polyak heavy-ball动量梯度下降算法。

Method: 通过构建在指数吸引不变流形上，证明了该算法在小步长下等价于具有修正损失的普通梯度下降。此外，还进行了细粒度的组合分析，推导了连续修正方程。

Result: 证明了全局近似界限，发现了隐藏在算法中的Eulerian和Narayana多项式，并推导了任意近似阶数的连续修正方程。

Conclusion: 理论结果揭示了heavy-ball动量梯度下降算法的主要特征，并为其他优化算法的类似分析提供了路线图。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文比较了 10 种不同的优化器在训练一个简单的多层感知器模型上的性能，该模型使用来自 Kaggle 的心脏病数据集。结果表明，收敛速度和稳定性之间存在权衡，RMSProp 是最有效的优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练深度学习模型时，优化是一个重要的因素和感兴趣的话题，但人们对如何选择用于训练这些模型的优化器的关注较少。因此，有必要更深入地研究我们如何选择用于训练的优化器以及决定这种选择的指标。

Method: 使用心脏病数据集，比较 10 种不同的优化器在训练一个简单的多层感知器模型上的性能。基于收敛速度和稳定性等指标评估优化器。包括一些其他的机器学习评估指标，如 AUC、精确率和召回率，这些指标是分类问题的核心指标。

Result: 结果表明，收敛速度和稳定性之间存在权衡，像 Adagrad 和 Adadelta 这样的优化器更稳定，但收敛时间更长。RMSProp 在所有指标中被选为最有效的心脏病预测任务优化器，因为它在关键指标上提供了平衡的性能。它实现了 0.765 的精确率，0.827 的召回率和 0.841 的 AUC，以及更快的训练时间，但它不是最稳定的。

Conclusion: 我们建议，在计算资源不太受限的环境中，应采用这种通过彻底评估来选择优化器的方法，以提高训练深度学习模型的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合变分降秩自编码器(VRRAE)和深度算子网络(DeepONet)的混合框架，以解决复杂几何形状的生成热设计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型（如AEs和VAEs）的非结构化潜在空间限制了其探索设计和生成物理一致解的能力，同时高保真模拟计算成本高昂。

Method: 该方法利用VRRAE在潜在空间中引入截断SVD，产生连续、可解释和结构良好的表示，以减轻后验崩溃并改善几何重建。然后，DeepONet利用这种紧凑的潜在编码及其分支网络中的空间坐标来有效和准确地预测温度梯度。

Result: 该混合方法提高了生成几何体的质量和梯度预测的准确性，并且与传统数值求解器相比，在推理效率方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了结构化潜在表示对于算子学习的重要性，并突出了生成模型和算子网络在热设计和更广泛的工程应用中结合的潜力。

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Result: 该算法在更少的用户约束输入下始终能够实现更准确的聚类，并且在计算性能和可扩展性方面优于同类算法，同时在各种距离指标上保持了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够以更少的用户约束输入实现更准确的聚类，并在计算性能和可扩展性方面优于同类算法，同时在各种距离指标上保持了鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Motivation: Timely and robust influenza forecasting is critical for public health decision-making.

Method: Adaptively fuses multi-modal inputs (surveillance, web search, weather) with a spectro-temporal architecture (Transformer, Mamba, temporal convolutions, frequency analysis) and cross-channel attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956 on 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data.

Conclusion: MAESTRO demonstrates the synergy of spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting. The modular pipeline is publicly available.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust

TL;DR: 大型神经模型被广泛应用，但其行为与人类价值观的对齐问题引人关注。可解释性是实现内部透明度的一种途径，揭示驱动输出的计算过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强调可解释性，特别是机制性方法，应被视为对齐的设计原则，而非辅助诊断工具。事后方法提供直观但相关的解释，而机制性技术则深入了解内部故障，包括欺骗性或未对齐的推理。

Method: 对比了事后可解释性方法（如LIME或SHAP）与机制性可解释性技术（如电路追踪或激活修补）。

Result: 机制性可解释性技术能够揭示行为方法可能忽略的内部故障，但可解释性面临可扩展性、认知不确定性以及学习表征与人类概念不匹配等挑战。

Conclusion: 为了实现安全可靠的AI，必须将可解释性作为AI研究和开发的首要目标，确保系统不仅有效，而且可审计、透明并与人类意图对齐。

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: 深度学习 (DL) 模型在原始加速度信号上的表现略优于在手工特征上训练的 DL 和经典 ML 模型，用于预测 24 小时活动行为强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较深度学习 (DL) 和经典机器学习 (ML) 算法在将 24 小时活动行为分类为睡眠、久坐、轻度体力活动 (LPA) 和中度至剧烈体力活动 (MVPA) 方面的性能。

Method: 使用来自 151 名佩戴腕式加速度计 (Axivity-AX3) 的成年人的开放获取数据。原始加速度信号被分割成不重叠的 10 秒窗口，然后提取总共 104 个手工特征。使用原始加速度信号和从这些信号中提取的手工特征训练了四种 DL 算法 - 长短期记忆 (LSTM)、双向长短期记忆 (BiLSTM)、门控循环单元 (GRU) 和一维卷积神经网络 (1D-CNN)，以预测 24 小时活动行为类别。手工特征还用于训练经典 ML 算法，即随机森林 (RF)、支持向量机 (SVM)、极限梯度提升 (XGBoost)、逻辑回归 (LR)、人工神经网络 (ANN) 和决策树 (DT)，用于对 24 小时活动行为强度进行分类。

Result: LSTM、BiLSTM 和 GRU 在使用原始加速度信号训练时，总体准确率约为 85%，而 1D-CNN 的总体准确率约为 80%。当在手工特征上训练时，DL 和经典 ML 算法的总体准确率范围为 70% 到 81%。总的来说，与睡眠和久坐类别相比，MVPA 和 LPA 的分类更加混乱。

Conclusion: 与使用手工特征训练 DL 和经典 ML 相比，使用原始加速度信号的 DL 方法在预测 24 小时活动行为强度方面只有略微更好的性能。

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

Motivation: DNNs for tabular data are blackboxes with little interpretability.

Method: a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space

Conclusion: XNNTab is fully interpretable while maintaining competitive performance

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的聚类质量评估方法，通过推导数据集中每个数据点的轮廓宽度上限，从而得到ASW的规范数据相关上限，该上限通常远低于1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASW是一种常用的聚类质量的内部度量，但其数据集特定的最大值通常是未知的，并且标准上限1通常是无法达到的。

Method: 本文为给定数据集中的每个数据点推导出一个清晰的轮廓宽度上限。通过聚合这些单独的界限，我们提出了ASW的规范数据相关上限。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，这些界限在许多情况下被证明是接近严格的，并显着丰富了聚类质量评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出的界限可以表明单个数据点是否可以被很好地放置，从而实现基于轮廓的优化循环的提前停止，并帮助回答一个关键问题：我的聚类结果与此特定数据的最佳可能结果有多接近？

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法可以激发更一致的神经策略。

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Method: 我们构建了一个模拟框架，生成2,500个合成数据集，每个数据集包含1,000名患者，以及基于痴呆风险因素的实际人口统计、遭遇和编码模式。SFI来自六个可解释的组成部分：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和轨迹稳定性。SFI感知校准应用了一个乘法调整，在50个模拟批次中进行了优化。

Result: 在最佳参数（α = 2.0）下，SFI感知校准显着改善了所有指标（p < 0.001）。收益范围从平衡准确度的10.3％到召回率的32.5％，精确度（31.9％）和F1分数（26.1％）显着提高。性能接近参考标准，F1分数和召回率在1％以内，平衡准确度和检测率分别提高了52.3％和41.1％。

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型泛化的一个易于处理的障碍。SFI感知校准提供了一种实用的、无标签的策略，以增强跨医疗保健环境的预测，特别是对于缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集。

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于环面的安全参数聚合方法，在保证完美隐私的同时避免了精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中，本地模型共享参数存在暴露敏感数据的风险；基于有限域的安全聚合存在精度和复杂度之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用环面而非有限域，利用环面上的均匀分布保证完美隐私。

Result: 实验结果表明，新协议在保持完美隐私的同时，性能与没有安全聚合的模型相似；在模型精度和余弦相似度方面，基于环面的协议在某些情况下明显优于基于有限域的安全聚合。

Conclusion: 基于环面的协议是一种更安全的选择。

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FAUST的算法，通过与相似性学习框架集成，改进了Forward-Forward算法，使其在准确性上更接近反向传播算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法存在生物学合理性问题和全局误差传播等局限性。Forward-Forward算法作为一种更符合生物学原理的方法被提出，但其准确率低于反向传播，且推理效率低。

Method: 将Forward-Forward算法与相似性学习框架相结合，消除了推理过程中多次前向传播的需求。提出的算法名为FAUST。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FAUST显著提高了准确性，缩小了与反向传播的差距。在CIFAR-10上，FAUST使用简单的多层感知器结构实现了56.22%的准确率，接近反向传播的57.63%的基准。

Conclusion: FAUST算法在准确性上显著改进了Forward-Forward算法，使其更接近反向传播算法的性能。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不断发展的IT环境中，系统的稳定性和可靠性至关重要，但其日益增长的复杂性给DevOps团队在实施和维护方面带来了挑战。日志分析是AIOps的核心要素，可提供对复杂行为和故障的关键见解。

Method: 该架构包含三个层次：日志调查（自主日志标记和异常分类），异常检测（灵活的异常检测方法，适用于无监督、弱监督和监督训练），以及根本原因分析（识别描述故障的最小日志集及其来源和事件序列）。

Result: 在公共和行业数据集上的评估显示，F1 分数在 0.98 和 1.0 之间，确保了可靠的异常检测。根本原因分析方法始终在前 10 个候选项中检测到 90-98% 的根本原因日志行。

Conclusion: 通过整合这三个层次，该架构为团队配备了强大的方法，以提高 IT 系统的可靠性，从而帮助 DevOps 高效地解决故障。

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究旨在利用机器学习模型，结合脑电皮层图（ECoG）数据、解剖区域标签和功能连接特征，预测大脑皮层区域对言语功能的重要性，以期在术前评估中改进功能定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言区附近进行脑部手术时，识别对言语至关重要的大脑皮层区域至关重要。传统的电刺激mapping (ESM)虽然是金标准，但具有侵入性和耗时性。

Method: 分析了16名参与者在执行言语任务时的颅内脑电皮层图(ECoG)数据，开发了机器学习模型来直接预测每个ECoG电极下方的脑区是否关键。结合神经活动信号、解剖区域标签和功能连接特征，捕捉局部活动和网络层面的动态。

Result: 结合区域和连接特征的模型与使用完整特征集的模型性能相匹配，并且优于单独使用任一类型的模型。最佳模型在留出参与者中实现了强大的准确性(ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57)。

Conclusion: 结合空间和网络信息与非线性建模，可以改善术前评估中的功能定位。

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的服务器扩展，该扩展充当可信计算基础 (TCB) 以实现恶意安全 DP-FTRL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设半诚实服务器，并且尚未解决安全消除此假设的挑战。这是由于其有状态性，这在客户端可能退出或被破坏的实际环境中变得特别成问题。

Method: 该 TCB 是在服务器端使用临时 TEE 模块实现的，以生成服务器操作的可验证证明。一些客户端在被选中后，参与审核这些证明，只需少量额外的通信和计算需求。

Result: 我们通过实验表明，我们的框架在几种实际环境中为客户端增加了小的恒定开销。

Conclusion: 我们提供了基于交互式差分隐私的正式证明，证明了恶意环境中的隐私保证。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署大型复杂 CNN 网络面临挑战，模型压缩成为研究领域，模型剪枝是其中的一种重要技术。

Method: 提出一种新的剪枝技术，即混合剪枝框架，它结合了通道和层剪枝。该方法受到 EfficientNet 的启发，但以相反的方式应用，通过剪枝来缩小网络规模。

Result: 实验表明，与基线模型相比，该混合方法显著降低了模型的整体复杂性，而准确率仅有 минимальное 降低。复杂性的降低转化为在 NVIDIA JETSON TX2 嵌入式 AI 设备上部署剪枝模型时延迟的降低。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的模型剪枝方法，能够在显著降低模型复杂性的同时，保持 минимальное 的准确率损失，从而降低了模型在边缘设备上的部署延迟。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全去中心化和异步的强化学习后训练算法SAPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决RL微调语言模型推理扩展所带来的技术挑战（例如延迟、内存和可靠性）以及不断增长的财务成本。

Method: SAPO被设计用于异构计算节点的去中心化网络，其中每个节点管理自己的策略模型，同时与网络中的其他节点“共享”rollout。

Result: 在受控实验中，SAPO实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益。

Conclusion: SAPO 避免了扩展 RL 后训练中的常见瓶颈，同时也允许（甚至鼓励）新的可能性。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Result: 通过仿真实验，将该方法与包括神经SDEs在内的其他基准方法进行比较，证明了该方法的有效性。在实证研究中，利用合成生成的样本路径来提高连续时间均值-方差投资组合选择的强化学习算法的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在金融分析和决策方面具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Result: 在MD17、MD22和OC20 200k数据集上，与非DEQ基模型相比，精度和速度提高了10%-20%。训练也更节省内存，从而可以在更大的系统上训练更具表现力的模型。

Conclusion: 通过利用分子系统的连续性，可以将等变基模型重塑为深度平衡模型，从而提高分子动力学模拟的精度、速度和内存效率。

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Motivation: 化学中的贝叶斯优化效率通常受到稀疏的实验数据和复杂的反应机制的阻碍。为了克服这些限制。

Method: ChemBOMAS的优化过程由LLM增强，并协同采用两种策略：知识驱动的粗粒度优化和数据驱动的细粒度优化。LLM通过推理现有的化学知识来识别有希望的候选区域，从而智能地分解广阔的搜索空间。LLM通过生成伪数据点来增强这些候选区域内的BO过程，从而提高数据利用效率并加速收敛。

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS是一种加速化学发现的强大工具。

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件 (MCI) 使医疗系统不堪重负，需要在极端压力下做出快速、准确的患者-医院分配决策。

Method: 开发了一个基于深度强化学习的决策支持 AI 代理，并通过 MasTER (一个可从网络访问的 MCI 管理模拟命令仪表板)进行集成。通过一项有 30 名参与者（6 名创伤专家和 24 名非专家）的受控用户研究，评估了三种与 AI 代理的交互方法（仅人工、人机协作和仅 AI）。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了我们 AI 驱动的决策支持在增强 MCI 准备培训和现实世界应急响应管理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Conclusion: 根据平台，在不同的边缘约束下对这些算法进行了广泛的实验，以观察它们的适用性和相应的异构模式。

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.
