Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable\ndata due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.\nData catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to\nanswer user queries.

This study\ninvestigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data\nand generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata.

Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to\nhuman-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic\nunderstanding.

This paper analyzes\nthe mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization\nand introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.\nSpecifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after\nmultiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,\nsimilar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this\ncontext, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of\nlow-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of\nhigh-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we\nsystematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson\nlocalization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in\nGraph Neural Networks.

For the retrieval task, we generated dense\nembeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an\nensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for\nre-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10\nof 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer\ngeneration, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our\nsystem achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of\n0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal\nanswers (rank 11).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728BioASQ 2025 Task13b\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728factoid\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bed\u4e49\u95ee\u7b54\u5728\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u751a\u81f3\u5916\u884c\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u7684PubMed\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u7528\u4e86instruction-tuned LLMs\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.1581\u7684MAP@10\uff0c\u5728yes/no\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.95\u7684macro-F1 score\uff0c\u5728factoid\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.64\u7684MRR\uff0c\u5728list\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.63\u7684mean-F1 score\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.29\u7684ROUGE-SU4 F1 score\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728BioASQ 2025 Task13b\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c10\uff0c\u5728yes/no\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c12\uff0c\u5728factoid\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c1\uff0c\u5728list\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c5\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c11\u3002"}}

This paper introduces\nYOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework\nspecifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural\nmodifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally\nefficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale\nfeature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an\nIntelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the\nnetwork's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for\nadaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive\nevaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate\nthat YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%\nmAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly\noutperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains\nreal-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.

Our asymmetric optimization\nstrategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions\nwhile collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global\ngeneralization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared\ncomponent is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across\neleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that\npFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and\ngeneralization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.

Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical\nchallenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made\nasynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.\nBy emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when\nevaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more\nreliable automated diagnostic support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u548c Agentic RAG\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC \u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8bca\u65ad\u51b3\u7b56\u901a\u5e38\u5fc5\u987b\u5f02\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1)\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u81ea Qwen\u3001Gemma \u548c LLaMA \u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c(2)\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u88c1\u51b3\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c(3) \u7ed3\u5408 Agentic \u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210 (agentic RAG)\uff0c\u4ece\u7f8e\u56fd\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u4f1a\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u60a3\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u56e2\u961f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\uff0c\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u516d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel approach combining profile generation via\nhierarchical interaction summarization (PGHIS), which leverages a pretrained\nLLM to hierarchically summarize user-item interactions, generating structured\ntextual profiles as explicit representations of user and item characteristics.\nAdditionally, we propose contrastive prompting for explanation generation\n(CPEG) which employs contrastive learning to guide another reasoning language\nmodels in producing high-quality ground truth recommendation explanations.\nFinally, we use the textual profiles of user and item as input and high-quality\nexplanation as output to fine-tune a LLM for generating explanations.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a great improvement on\nmetrics about explainability (e.g., 5% on GPTScore) and text quality.\nFurthermore, our generated ground truth explanations achieve a significantly\nhigher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other\nmethods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPEG in generating high-quality\nground truths.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a new method for generating explainable recommendations that uses LLMs to create textual profiles of users and items and contrastive learning to generate high-quality explanations, outperforming existing methods.", "motivation": "Existing methods primarily rely on encoding features of users and items to embeddings, which often leads to information loss.

We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that\nguides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a\nlanguage-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.\nFinally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to\nassess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning\ntraces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.\nOur results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning\nfidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement\nlearning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.\nhttps://jd730.github.io/projects/GeoFact-X_BRIDGE", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86GeoFact-X\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u65e5\u8bed\u3001\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed\u548c\u6cf0\u8bed\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5BRIDGE\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed\u6216\u6cf0\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0cLLM \u7ecf\u5e38\u4f1a\u8bef\u89e3\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51faBRIDGE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBRIDGE \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "BRIDGE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To incorporate user\nhistory for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional\ndiffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing\nitems from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However,\nthis design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets\ndistracted by the need to model the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ noise\" translation.\nThis motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential\nrecommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of\nnoise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting\npoint of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input.

However, because data from different modalities are\ntypically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental\nconditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution\ndiscrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.\nFurthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater\nchallenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space.

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97).

However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples.

To address\nthis, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time\nframework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local\nmode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,\ncomputing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective\noutputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,\nhigher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local\nmode-seeking mechanism, acting as \"collective wisdom\", steers samples away from\nspurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model\nimperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows\nus to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by\nsimultaneously sampling multiple particles.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel\nChinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records\nannotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme\nassesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and\nICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.\nCrucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate\nhow different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP\nand its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations.

Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical\nsuccess across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the\ngeneralization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring\neither graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer.

Existing prompt-based and adapter-based\nworks have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the\nchallenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards\nunseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating\nall tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting\non less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and\ndegrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept\nrecognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a\nnovel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class\ngeneralization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the\nimportance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first\nemploys token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and\ngroup tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to\nthe importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature\nranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response\nmechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels\nidentified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1\nregularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA\nover existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on\nvarious benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and\ndomain generalization.

This broad definition of brain lesions includes\nareas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain\ntissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the\nimportance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing\nlesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as\na single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework\nfor analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first\nsegments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue\ndeformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating\nthe core lesion area representing the initial damage.

A critical challenge in GUI\nautomation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse\nplatforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large\nand cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant\ninformation that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches\ntypically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,\nwhich fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established\nobject detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these\nissues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages\nzoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization.

A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct\nvalidity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended\ntrait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.\nTo make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation\nusing LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which\nthe same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By\nsimulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that\nrobustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items.

Although\nvanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal\nmovement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over\nboth camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the\nunstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose\nLiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core\nprinciples: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we\nanalyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling\ndecoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced\nacross layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.\nThird, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)\nto linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a\nmodified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we\nextend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,\nunifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that\nLiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy\nand motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal\ntraining data.

To address this gap, we introduce FEVO\n(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance\nLLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM\nperformance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain\nknowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate\nreasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the\nexpanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To\nensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models\nand rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets\nspecifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our\nframework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from\nQwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and\ngeneral capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger\nmodels as well as specialist models.

Code:\n  https://github.com/wangbing1416/DAEDCMD", "summary": "Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely\nspread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting.

In this\nstudy, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image\nregistration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical\nproperties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease\nclassification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean\nmaterial to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field\nwhile ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable\napproach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides\ninsights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.\nEvaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved\nDice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right\nventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the\nlocal strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features\nused for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five\nclassification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support\nVector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the\nmost relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing\nclassifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and\n100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset.
