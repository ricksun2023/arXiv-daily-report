### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的自包含式LLM卸载方法，该方法直接优化令牌级别的目标，无需外部资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM卸载方法通常依赖于辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这既不实用，也可能引入额外的隐私风险。

Method: 该方法识别两种类型的令牌：捕获关键知识以进行卸载的目标令牌，以及对于维持模型效用至关重要的非目标令牌。前者用于优化卸载目标，而后者用于保持模型的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的DTO在多个基准数据集上实现了比最新基线高达16.8倍的遗忘质量提升，同时保持了相当水平的模型效用。

Conclusion: DTO方法在LLM卸载方面具有显著优势，因为它无需外部资源，并且能够在提高遗忘质量的同时保持模型效用。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

### [2] [TAMA: Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Procedural Activity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00161)
*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAMA的新框架，用于程序活动理解，该框架利用多媒体工具实现交错的多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管程序活动助手具有潜力，但为此类助手量身定制的系统开发仍未被充分探索。

Method: TAMA通过在无训练设置中使用多媒体返回工具来实现交错的多模态推理。

Result: 在多模态程序问答数据集ProMQA-Assembly上的实验结果表明，该方法可以提高视觉语言模型的性能，特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL。

Conclusion: 我们提出的框架和实验结果有助于视频和多模态任务的图像思考范例，更不用说程序活动助手的开发。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

### [3] [DRBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Enterprise Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00172)
*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Tianyi Chen,Miguel Muñoz-Mármol,Curtis Fox,Amrutha Varshini Ramesh,Étienne Marcotte,Xing Han Lù,Nicolas Chapados,Spandana Gella,Christopher Pal,Alexandre Drouin,Issam H. Laradji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench是一个用于评估AI agent在企业环境中执行复杂、开放式深度研究任务的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准主要关注简单问题或仅限网络的查询，而DRBench旨在评估agent在多步骤查询中的能力，这些查询需要从公共网络和私有公司知识库中识别支持性事实。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流程生成任务，并进行人工验证。通过评估agent回忆相关见解、保持事实准确性以及生成连贯、结构良好的报告的能力来评估agent。

Result: 发布了跨越销售、网络安全和合规性等10个领域的15个深度研究任务。通过评估各种开放和闭源模型以及深度研究策略，展示了DRBench的有效性。

Conclusion: 强调了现有AI agent在企业深度研究方面的优势、劣势以及关键发展路径。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了语言模型是否可以利用个人信仰系统来改进对齐，重点关注观点预测领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地向语言模型表达个体用户的信仰系统，从而提升模型对齐效果。

Method: 构建了一个包含858名美国居民的公众意见调查数据集PrimeX，该数据集包含受访者的观点解释和世界观评估。

Result: 证明了信仰解释和世界观对于个性化语言模型的价值。

Conclusion: PrimeX数据集中的额外信仰信息有益于自然语言处理和心理学研究领域，为进一步研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)在解决任务和偏好对齐方面是分开处理的，但这种模式在面向用户的应用中会失败，因为如果响应与用户的需求不匹配，那么正确地解决问题是不够的。我们提出了PREFDISCO，它将静态基准转换为交互式个性化任务。对10个任务的21个前沿模型进行评估后发现，幼稚的个性化尝试中，有29.0%的偏好对齐效果比通用响应更差。PREFDISCO将个性化推理确立为一个可衡量的研究前沿，并揭示了当前LLM交互能力的根本局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型(LLM)在解决任务和偏好对齐方面是分开处理的，但这种模式在面向用户的应用中会失败，因为如果响应与用户的需求不匹配，那么仅仅正确地解决问题是不够的，尤其是在由于冷启动条件或隐私限制而没有先前用户交互历史的即时场景中，这种挑战会加剧。

Method: 我们引入了PREFDISCO，这是一种评估方法，它使用心理学基础的角色和稀疏的偏好，将静态基准转换为交互式个性化任务。我们的框架创建了这样的场景：相同的问题需要不同的推理链，这取决于用户的背景，因为最佳的解释方法因个人的专业知识和偏好而异，同时保持事实的准确性。

Result: 对10个任务的21个前沿模型进行评估后发现，幼稚的个性化尝试中，有29.0%的偏好对齐效果比通用响应更差，但通用响应也未能有效地满足个人用户的需求。这些发现表明，个性化推理需要专门的开发，而不是自然而然地出现。

Conclusion: PREFDISCO将个性化推理确立为一个可衡量的研究前沿，并揭示了当前LLM交互能力的根本局限性，为开发能够在教育、医疗保健和技术领域适应个人用户的系统奠定了基础，在这些领域中，个性化至关重要。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的LLM偏见缓解方法使用不同的基线和指标来评估去偏见性能，导致它们之间的比较不一致。此外，它们的评估主要基于LLM对有偏见和无偏见上下文的概率比较，忽略了这些评估与实际用例之间的差距。为了实现跨去偏见方法的一致评估并弥合这一差距，我们引入了BiasFreeBench，这是一个经验基准，通过将现有数据集重组为统一的查询-响应设置，全面比较了两种测试场景（多项选择QA和开放式多轮QA）中的八种主流偏见缓解技术（包括四种基于提示的方法和四种基于训练的方法）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）偏见缓解方法研究使用不同的基线和指标来评估去偏见性能，导致它们之间的比较不一致。此外，它们的评估大多基于LLM对有偏见和无偏见上下文的概率比较，忽略了这种评估与实际使用场景之间的差距。

Method: 我们引入了BiasFreeBench，这是一个经验基准，通过将现有数据集重组为统一的查询-响应设置，全面比较了两种测试场景（多项选择QA和开放式多轮QA）中的八种主流偏见缓解技术（包括四种基于提示的方法和四种基于训练的方法）。我们进一步引入了一个响应级别的指标，即Bias-Free Score，以衡量LLM响应在多大程度上是公平、安全和反刻板印象的。

Result: 对跨关键维度（提示与训练范式、模型大小以及不同训练策略对未见过的偏见类型的泛化）的去偏见性能进行了系统比较和分析。

Conclusion: 我们将公开发布我们的基准，旨在为偏见缓解研究建立一个统一的试验台。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASER使用大型推理模型进行自动翻译质量评估，在WMT24 Metrics Shared Task上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评估指标缺乏可解释性。

Method: 利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力，进行系统性的逐步评估翻译质量。

Result: 在系统级别评估中，TASER在基于参考和无参考的设置中均实现了最高的软成对准确率，优于所有现有指标。在段级别，TASER保持了与无参考变体相当的性能，在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面取得了显著进展，在各种语言对中结合了更高的准确性和透明的评估。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261)
*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个开源的用于心电图语言模型（ELM）的RAG（检索增强生成）流程，并进行了基线和消融研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心电图语言模型（ELM）研究缺乏开源实现和对RAG流程设计的系统研究。RAG可以提升自然语言生成效果，减少幻觉。

Method: 提出了一个开源的RAG流程，并进行了基线和消融研究。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，带有RAG的ELM始终优于非RAG基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出的RAG流程可以有效提升ELM的性能，并强调了ELM设计的关键考虑因素。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的对齐越来越依赖于使用其他 LLM 作为自动评估器。然而，它们的可靠性受到一个根本问题的限制：它们是在离散偏好标签上训练的，这迫使单一的真实性进入到通常是主观的、模糊的或细微的任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的自动评估器必须学习对由目标人群定义的偏好的完整分布进行建模。本文提出了一个通用框架，用于将概率自动评估器校准到任何给定的偏好分布。

Method: 提出了两种针对不同数据条件的学习方法：1) 针对密集概率标签的直接监督微调，以及 2) 针对稀疏二元标签的强化学习方法。

Result: 使用分布匹配目标微调自动评估器可以生成与目标偏好分布更好地对齐的口头概率预测，具有改进的校准和显着降低的位置偏差，同时保持在客观任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 分布匹配目标微调自动评估器可以提高性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALARB: 用于评估大型语言模型在阿拉伯法律领域推理能力的数据集和任务套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准测试缺乏专门针对阿拉伯语LLM的多步骤推理（尤其是在开放式上下文中）的大型数据集。

Method: 利用来自沙特阿拉伯的超过13K的商业案例，每个案例包括事实、法院推理、判决以及引用的法规条款。

Result: 通过指令调整，一个适度的12B参数模型在使用ALARB后，在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成方面的性能显著提高，达到与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集对于指令调整非常有用，可以显著提高模型在阿拉伯法律领域的推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

### [11] [Efficient Layer-wise LLM Fine-tuning for Revision Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00268)
*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型在文本分类任务中的应用，特别是在细微文本修订分类方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型虽然在文本生成方面表现出色，但在文本分类方面的潜力尚未充分挖掘，尤其是在处理细微的文本修订时。直接对大型语言模型进行微调需要大量的修订标注数据，而这些数据非常昂贵且稀缺。

Method: 论文提出了一种即插即用的分层参数高效微调框架（IR-Tuning），该框架基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要的LLM层进行微调，同时冻结冗余层。

Result: 实验结果表明，IR-Tuning在不同的文本修订任务上优于其他分层PEFT基线方法，同时实现了快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗，并且在小型修订语料库上有效。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning 是一种有效的参数高效微调框架，特别适用于处理细微文本修订分类任务，并且能够克服数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafePassage是一个三步流程，用于减少LLM信息提取中的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的信息提取难以信任，因为提取的信息不一定以文档为基础。

Method: SafePassage包含：(1) LLM提取器，用于从文档中生成结构化实体及其上下文，(2) 基于字符串的全局对齐器，(3) 评分模型。

Result: SafePassage pipeline可以将信息提取任务中的幻觉减少高达85%，并且标记非幻觉的风险极小。transformer编码器在少量特定任务示例上进行微调，可以优于LLM评分模型。

Conclusion: SafePassage pipeline和人类判断提取质量之间的高度一致性意味着该流程可以双重用于评估LLM。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

*Ziliang Wang,Kang An,Xuhui Zheng,Faqiang Qian,Weikun Zhang,Cijun Ouyang,Jialu Cai,Yuhang Wang,Yichao Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为可擦除强化学习（ERL）的新框架，旨在提高大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂多跳推理中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索增强的LLM在复杂多跳推理中存在可靠性问题，这源于分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误这三个根本挑战。

Method: 该方法通过显式识别错误步骤，擦除它们，并就地重新生成推理，从而防止缺陷逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的模型ESearch在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle数据集上取得了显著改进，3B模型实现了+8.48% EM和+11.56% F1，7B模型实现了+5.38% EM和+7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为LLM中鲁棒的多步推理提供了一个强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 提出了一个临床Meta评估框架，定义了临床标准，包括临床一致性和关键指标能力（区分性、稳健性和单调性）。

Result: 系统地评估了现有指标，揭示了它们在解释临床语义方面的局限性，例如无法区分临床意义上的错误，过度惩罚无害的变异，以及缺乏跨错误严重程度级别的一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更可靠的临床评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的普及提高了NLP领域的水平，同时也带来了模型透明性和可信度方面的严峻挑战。选择最佳可解释性方法是一个挑战。

Method: 提出一个超参数优化工具，旨在自动识别语义匹配领域中最有效的可解释AI方法及其配置。在social media posts paired with refuting claims数据集上评估o-mega。

Result: 通过系统地探索不同的可解释方法及其超参数，证明了在自动事实核查系统中提高了透明度。

Conclusion: 这种解释方法的自动优化可以显著提高诸如错误信息检测等关键应用中claim-matching模型的可解释性，从而有助于建立更值得信赖和透明的AI系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 CORTEX 的多智能体 LLM 架构，用于高风险警报分流，该架构通过专门的智能体协作处理真实证据，以减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的安全运营中心 (SOC) 面临海量警报，导致分析师疲劳和威胁遗漏。现有的基于 LLM 的方法在处理嘈杂的企业数据和提供透明度方面存在局限性。

Method: 本文提出 CORTEX，一种多智能体 LLM 架构，其中行为分析智能体检查活动序列，证据收集智能体查询外部系统，推理智能体将结果合成为可审计的决策。

Result: CORTEX 在各种企业场景中，显著减少了误报，并提高了优于最先进的单智能体 LLM 的调查质量。

Conclusion: CORTEX 是一种用于高风险警报分流的多智能体 LLM 架构，通过智能体协作处理真实证据，能够有效减少误报并提高调查质量。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

### [17] [TokMem: Tokenized Procedural Memory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00444)
*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem是一种token化的程序记忆，可以存储重复的过程作为可训练的嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型严重依赖prompt来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，但这效率低下，因为prompt必须在每个步骤中重新读取，跨任务的扩展性差，并且缺乏模块化重用的机制。

Method: 我们引入了TokMem，一种token化的程序记忆，它将重复的过程存储为紧凑的、可训练的嵌入。每个记忆token都编码一个过程的地址和一个控制信号，该信号控制生成，从而以恒定大小的开销实现目标行为。为了支持持续适应，TokMem保持backbone模型冻结，允许添加新的过程而不会干扰现有的过程。

Result: 我们在1000个任务上评估了TokMem的原子回忆，以及在函数调用任务上的组合回忆，在这些任务中，它始终优于检索增强生成，同时避免了重复的上下文开销，并且使用更少的参数进行微调。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，TokMem是一种可扩展且模块化的prompt工程和微调替代方案，为LLM提供了一种显式的程序记忆。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一种用于代码LLM的新型即插即用代码压缩框架，旨在通过在不降低任务性能的情况下有效减少上下文大小，从而使LLM更好地扩展到实际的大规模代码场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文修剪技术（如LLMLingua）在通用文本方面取得了可喜的成果，但忽略了代码特定的结构和依赖关系，导致编程任务的性能欠佳。

Method: LongCodeZip采用双阶段策略：(1) 粗粒度压缩，它使用相对于指令的条件困惑度来识别和排列函数级块，仅保留最相关的函数；(2) 细粒度压缩，它根据困惑度将保留的函数分割成块，并在自适应令牌预算下选择最佳子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在包括代码完成、摘要和问题解答在内的多项任务中的评估表明，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在不降低任务性能的情况下实现了高达5.6倍的压缩率。

Conclusion: LongCodeZip通过有效减少上下文大小同时保留基本信息，使LLM能够更好地扩展到实际的大规模代码场景，从而提高了代码智能应用程序的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 进行 Likert 量表评分预测，这是一种需要语言和数学推理的回归任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中在分类或排序任务上，而忽略了 Likert 量表评分预测这一回归任务。该任务在工业界有重要的应用，但 LLM 的应用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 本文通过在三个数据集上对八个模型进行综合实验，研究了现成的 LLM 在评分预测方面的性能，并提供了不同的上下文信息。

Result: 用户撰写的评论能够显著提高 LLM 的评分预测性能，与矩阵分解等传统方法相当。针对具体项目的评论比一般的偏好描述更有效。提示 LLM 首先生成假设的评论可以提高评分预测性能。

Conclusion: LLM 在解决冷启动问题方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Agent LLM主要依赖In-context learning，存在输入冗长和计算成本高的问题，而Agent Fine-tuning通过训练使LLM内化程序推理和领域知识，但在特定技术微领域的效果尚不明确。

Method: 使用从JP1领域手册中提取的数据集和LLM生成的推理轨迹对LLM进行Fine-tuning，并结合检索增强生成和上下文答案提取器来提高信息相关性。

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法比基础模型提高了14%的性能。

Conclusion: Agent Fine-tuning在复杂微领域的领域特定推理中具有潜力。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

Method: 提出了Agent-ScanKit，一个系统的探测框架，通过视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导三种正交的探测范式，量化多模态智能体的记忆和推理能力。

Result: 在五个公开的GUI基准测试中，结果表明机械记忆通常超过系统推理，大多数模型主要作为训练知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，对于现实世界场景中的多模态智能体，强大的推理建模是必要的，并为开发可靠的多模态智能体提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech is a speech-to-speech LLM that directly understands and generates speech without text guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spoken dialogue systems rely on text intermediates, creating a bottleneck and discarding paralinguistic cues.

Method: Combines a modality-based layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech performance relative to existing text-guided systems.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction by narrowing the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

Motivation: 现有的评估方法无法充分评估多模态LLM驱动的agent在动态环境和多样化任务中的真实能力；现有的基于LLM的合成数据方法不能直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的agent任务；现有的自动agent任务生成方法主要局限于文本或图像分析，没有系统地建模Web环境中的多步骤交互。

Method: 利用从多源外部数据构建的知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图抽样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化的多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道，以保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: Graph2Eval能够有效地生成区分agent和模型性能的任务，揭示了不同设置下推理、协作和Web交互方面的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为agent评估提供了一个新的视角。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为CopyPasteLLM的方法，通过高复制响应偏好训练来提高检索增强生成（RAG）中上下文的真实性，减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强生成（RAG）中生成上下文相关的响应时，仍然面临上下文真实性的挑战，因为LLMs可能不总是信任提供的上下文，导致幻觉。

Method: 该论文提出通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练得到CopyPasteLLM，并设计了三种prompting方法来提高复制程度。

Result: CopyPasteLLM在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上取得了最佳性能，尤其是在FaithEval上，相比最佳基线提高了12.2%到24.5%的准确率，并且只需要基线数据1/50的训练样本。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖，而不是外部知识，来提高上下文真实性并减少幻觉。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for

a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,

multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework

Motivation: 现有多语种数据集对大多数语言的数据不足，导致训练模型在多数支持的语言上表现不佳。

Method: 该流程包括媒体检索和两阶段对齐算法，用于处理非逐字稿和长篇音频。

Result: 从22个欧洲议会的录音中提取了超过6.1万小时的对齐语音片段，其中19种语言超过1千小时，22种语言超过500小时的高质量语音数据。在我们的数据集上微调现有的ASR模型，单词错误率平均降低了41.8%。

Conclusion: 证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 监督式微调（SFT）是后训练大型语言模型（LLM）的标准方法，但它通常表现出有限的泛化能力。本文将此限制追溯到其默认训练目标：负对数似然（NLL）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然 NLL 在从头开始训练时是经典最优的，但后训练在不同的范例中运行，并且可能违反其最优性假设，即模型已经编码了任务相关的先验知识，并且监督可以是长期的和noisy。

Method: 本文研究了一般概率目标族，并描述了它们在不同条件下的有效性。通过全面的实验和跨 7 个模型骨干、14 个基准和 3 个领域的广泛消融研究，我们发现了一个控制目标行为的关键维度：模型能力连续体。

Result: 在模型较强的一端附近，倾向于低概率token的目标（例如，$-p$, $-p^{10}$，阈值变体）始终优于 NLL；在模型较弱的一端，NLL 占主导地位；在这两者之间，没有单一的目标占主导地位。

Conclusion: 我们的理论分析进一步阐明了目标如何在连续体中进行权衡，为根据模型能力调整目标提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

*Kung-Hsiang Huang,Haoyi Qiu,Yutong Dai,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI-KV is a KV cache compression method for GUI agents that exploits spatial and temporal redundancy to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents face inefficiency challenges due to processing long sequences of high-resolution screenshots. Existing cache compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs.

Method: GUI-KV combines spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states, and temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history.

Result: GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines and closely matches full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. In a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline.

Conclusion: Exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

*Minjae Oh,Sangjun Song,Seungkyu Lee,Sungmin Jo,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小型推理模型在使用工具时经常过度思考，导致最终结果错误。通过注入</think>标签进行诊断，发现有很大的优化空间。提出了ThinkBrake方法，通过监测</think>标签和当前最佳token的log-probability差值来提前终止推理，从而在保证或提高准确率的同时减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要集中在数学推理上，而对工具推理的研究不足。小型推理模型在使用工具时存在过度思考的问题。

Method: 通过oracle rollouts注入</think>标签来诊断过度思考问题。提出了ThinkBrake，一种无需训练的解码启发式方法，监测</think>标签和当前最佳token的log-probability差值，并在差值变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)上，oracle termination将平均准确率从85.8%提高到94.2%，同时减少了80-94%的token。ThinkBrake在BFCL的single turn, non-live和live splits上，保持或提高了准确率，同时减少了高达25%的token使用，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 小型推理模型在使用工具时存在过度思考的问题，通过ThinkBrake方法可以有效解决这个问题，提高效率和准确率。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

*Yubo Xie,Chenkai Wang,Zongyang Ma,Fahui Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CHIME，一个用于解释中文互联网meme的数据集，并评估了大型语言模型(llm)理解这些meme的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型是否真正理解在网络上迅速传播的流行内容(通常被称为meme)?

Method: 设计了两个任务来评估llm是否理解这些meme。第一个任务评估模型解释meme、识别其来源和生成适当的例句的能力。第二个任务创建了一组多项选择题(mcq)，要求llm选择最合适的meme来填补上下文句子中的空白。

Result: llm可以解释某些meme的含义，但对于文化和语言细微差别的meme类型，其性能显著下降。此外，他们始终难以提供meme的准确来源。虽然被评估的模型能够提供正确的答案，但它们的性能仍然明显低于人类水平。

Conclusion: CHIME已公开，希望它将促进未来对计算meme理解的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

### [31] [ReSeek: A Self-Correcting Framework for Search Agents with Instructive Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00568)
*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSeek提出了一种新颖的自校正框架，用于训练搜索代理，通过引入自校正机制和设计密集的过程奖励函数，使代理能够动态地识别和从错误的搜索路径中恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的方法通常依赖于稀疏或基于规则的奖励，这可能导致代理在没有恢复能力的情况下，致力于次优或错误的推理路径。

Method: ReSeek框架引入了一个自校正机制，该机制使代理能够动态地识别和从episode中错误的搜索路径中恢复。通过调用一个特殊的JUDGE动作，代理可以判断信息并重新规划其搜索策略。为了指导这个过程，我们设计了一个密集的、有指导意义的过程奖励函数，它分解为用于检索事实信息的正确性奖励和用于发现对查询真正有用的信息的效用奖励。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面明显优于SOTA基线。

Conclusion: ReSeek是一种用于训练搜索代理的自校正框架，它通过引入自校正机制和设计密集的过程奖励函数，显著提高了任务成功率和路径忠实度。此外，我们引入了FictionalHot，这是一个新的且具有挑战性的基准，其中包含最近策划的需要复杂推理的问题，以减轻现有数据集中数据污染的风险。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种低成本提升大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的方法，通过学习紧凑的CoT向量来编码通用推理知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT方法成本高效率低。

Method: 引入CoT向量，并提出可学习的CoT向量，通过教师-学生框架优化。

Result: CoT向量在多种基准测试和模型上优于现有基线，性能与参数高效微调方法相当，且所需的可训练参数更少。

Conclusion: 通过将CoT向量作为探针，揭示了其有效性如何因潜在空间结构、信息密度、获取机制和预训练差异而变化，为LLM中多步骤推理的功能组织提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Result: 在多个语言区分基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的性能，相对于以前的方法，性能相对提高了 23% 到 52%。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推动了语言区分的研究，而且为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Tenyidie语是一种低资源语言，自然语言处理(NLP)方面的研究非常有限。据我们所知，还没有关于这种语言的音节划分的研究。

Method: 本文应用了LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and Encoder-decoder等深度学习架构。

Result: 在80:10:10 (train:validation:test)的数据集划分中，使用BLSTM模型在测试集上获得了99.21%的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作将应用于许多其他的NLP应用，例如形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等，为Tenyidie语服务。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

*Jinlan Fu,Shenzhen Huangfu,Hao Fei,Yichong Huang,Xiaoyu Shen,Xipeng Qiu,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的alt-text生成方法MCM-DPO，该方法通过学习识别偏好对中更好的选项来改进alt-text生成，而无需精确的注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的alt-text生成性能由于用户注释的噪声、不一致的标准以及MLLM对上下文信息的不敏感性而受到限制。之前的监督微调(SFT)方法依赖于精确的目标注释，但用户生成的alt-text通常存在缺陷。

Method: 提出了多方面跨模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，它优化了跨单、配对和多偏好维度的偏好，涵盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素。构建了两个大规模高质量数据集TAlt和PAlt。

Result: 实验结果表明，MCM-DPO方法始终优于DPO和SFT，在alt-text生成方面建立了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: MCM-DPO 是一种有效的 alt-text 生成方法，它通过利用偏好学习和高质量数据集，在现有技术水平上取得了显著的进步。

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用大型语言模型(llm)自动生成easy-to-read(etr)内容的方法，旨在简化复杂文本，使认知障碍人士更容易获取信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为确保公平地获取信息，特别是对于有认知障碍的个体，简化复杂文本至关重要。easy-to-read (etr) 倡议提供了一个框架，使神经多样性人群可以访问内容，但是手动创建此类文本仍然非常耗时且需要大量资源。

Method: 我们提出了一种多任务学习(mtl)方法，该方法在文本摘要、文本简化和etr生成上联合训练模型，以解决对齐语料库的稀缺性和etr约束的特殊性。我们探索了两种不同的策略：用于上下文学习的多任务检索增强生成(rag)和用于参数高效微调的mtl-lora。

Result: 基于etr-fr (一种新的高质量数据集)对mistral-7b和llama-3-8b进行的实验表明，在所有配置中，多任务设置优于单任务基线。此外，结果表明，基于rag的策略能够在领域外环境中实现泛化，而mtl-lora在领域内配置中优于所有学习策略。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在自动生成easy-to-read内容方面具有潜力，多任务学习方法可以有效提高生成质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建易读文本成本高、速度慢且难以扩展，AI驱动的ETR生成可以提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 该研究构建了首个符合欧洲ETR指南的ETR-fr数据集，并在PLM和LLM上进行了参数高效的微调，建立了生成基线。同时，提出了一个基于自动指标和人工评估的评估框架。

Result: 结果表明，PLM的性能与LLM相当，并且能够有效地适应领域外的文本。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI生成易读文本提供了一个有价值的数据集、方法和评估框架。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

TL;DR: 研究如何将小型高效的LLM适配到低资源北日耳曼语系语言法罗语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏现有的法罗语评估数据，我们从改编的和新收集的数据集中构建了两个新的最小对基准，并用法罗语语言学家的评估来补充它们。

Method: 从英语模型开始，我们继续在相关的斯堪的纳维亚语言上进行预训练，单独或通过合并组合，然后在法罗语上进行微调。我们将完整微调与使用LoRA的参数高效微调进行比较，评估它们对语言准确性和文本理解的影响。

Result: 来自相关语言的转移是至关重要的，尽管最佳源语言取决于任务：冰岛语提高了语言准确性，而丹麦语提高了理解力。同样，完整微调和LoRA之间的选择取决于任务：LoRA提高了语言可接受性，并略微提高了基础模型上的人工评估分数，而完整微调产生了更强的理解性能，并在下游微调期间更好地保留了模型能力。

Conclusion: 迁移学习对于低资源语言至关重要，最佳源语言和微调方法取决于具体任务。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Motivation: 评估REAL-MT在噪声检索环境下的可靠性，因为这是实际部署中的常见挑战。

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新指标，系统地评估REAL-MT的鲁棒性。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下表现更差，LRM模型对噪声更敏感，会合理化错误信息。

Conclusion: 现有方法存在局限性，需要自验证的集成机制。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，忽略了当实现目标的最佳路径与人类安全冲突时，agent采取有害行动的挑战。

Method: 引入ManagerBench基准，评估LLM在现实、人工验证的管理场景中的决策。

Result: 发现前沿LLM在权衡安全性和实用性方面表现不佳，要么选择有害选项以实现目标，要么为了避免伤害而变得过于安全和无效。

Conclusion: LLM的这种不一致并非源于无法感知伤害，而是源于错误的优先级排序。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在许多NLP任务中表现出色，但仍然容易产生幻觉，限制了对现实世界应用的信任。

Method: HalluGuard将文档-声明对分类为有根据或产生幻觉，并生成基于证据的理由以提高透明度。我们的方法包括：(i)一个来自FineWeb的领域无关的合成数据集，并通过多阶段管理和数据改造进行改进，(ii)合成的有根据的和产生幻觉的声明，以及(iii)基于偏好的微调，通过优势比偏好优化将大型模型推理提炼成更小的backbone。

### [42] [Span-level Detection of AI-generated Scientific Text via Contrastive Learning and Structural Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00890)
*Zhen Yin,Shenghua Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为Sci-SpanDet的框架，用于检测AI生成的学术文本，该框架在跨学科数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学写作中的快速应用引发了对作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的担忧。现有的检测方法存在局限性，例如忽略细粒度的跨度定位，校准不佳，并且通常无法跨学科和生成器推广。

Method: 该方法结合了section-conditioned的文体建模和多层次的对比学习，以捕捉细微的人工智能差异，同时减轻主题依赖性，从而增强跨领域鲁棒性。此外，它还集成了BIO-CRF序列标记与基于指针的边界解码和置信度校准，以实现精确的跨度级别检测和可靠的概率估计。

Result: 在包含由多个LLM家族生成的100,000个带注释样本的跨学科数据集上进行的大量实验表明，Sci-SpanDet实现了最先进的性能，F1(AI)为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet在对抗性重写下表现出强大的弹性，并在IMRaD部分和不同的学科中保持平衡的准确性，大大超过了现有的基线。该数据集和源代码将在发布后公开发布，以确保可重复性并促进对学术文档中AI生成文本检测的进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用检索增强生成（RAG）方法来提高基础模型在解决奥林匹克物理问题方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激发学生通过回顾过去的问题来准备竞赛的方式，探索RAG在增强基础模型物理推理方面的潜力。

Method: 引入PhoPile，一个专为奥林匹克物理设计的高质量多模态数据集，以系统地研究基于检索的推理。使用PhoPile，对RAG增强的基础模型进行基准测试，包括大型语言模型（LLM）和具有多个检索器的大型多模态模型（LMM）。

Result: 结果表明，将检索与物理语料库相结合可以提高模型性能，同时也突出了挑战。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了检索增强物理推理的进一步研究的必要性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Marzieh Fadaee,Julia Kreutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法FusioN，它将多个LLM生成样本中最有用的元素合成为一个最终答案，而不是像Best-of-N那样选择单个最佳样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Best-of-N方法本质上是零和的，丢弃了来自样本池中多样且潜在有用的信息。因此，作者希望探索一种协作设置，其中所有候选样本都可以为最终的生成结果做出贡献。

Method: 提出了Fusion-of-N (FusioN)方法，该方法使用一个通用的LLM裁判将每个样本中最有用的元素综合成一个最终答案。

Result: 在测试时扩展和合成数据生成两个设置中，FusioN始终优于BoN，在11种语言、3个不同任务和不同模型规模上都表现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们应该转变我们对评估和利用LLM生成的方式的看法，从单一的质量衡量标准，转变为拥抱它们的多样性。这种转变使我们能够整合不同的优势，释放潜在的潜力，并实现以前仅通过选择无法实现的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Motivation: 分析将“标准”美式英语问题归类为非“标准”方言变体对多项选择题回答任务的影响。

Method: 在多项选择题回答任务上，分析将“标准”美式英语问题归类为非“标准”方言变体的影响；研究非“标准”英语问题中表现不佳的语法基础。

Result: 准确率降低高达20%；发现某些语法规则对性能的影响比其他规则更大；三种特定的语法规则（存在性“it”、零系动词和“y'all”）可以解释在多种方言中观察到的大部分性能下降。

Conclusion: 未来的工作应调查侧重于个体、高影响力语法结构的偏差缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的语法引导扩散语言模型，旨在提高文本质量、多样性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型生成的文本通常过于通用，缺乏足够的结构多样性，限制了个性化表达。

Method: 该模型采用级联框架，先生成句法指导，再进行条件文本生成，并将其推广到一种新的非级联架构，以更好地对齐结构和内容。同时，开发了一种共享表示机制，以促进跨用户的信息集成，支持忠实的文体生成和可推广的零样本推理。

Result: 在多个任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在流畅性、多样性和文体保真度方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型通过结合句法信息，能够更好地捕捉文体句子构建的词汇和结构特征，并具有良好的可解释性和学习个性化模式的灵活性。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Motivation: 理解神经网络的决策过程是可解释性的核心目标。对于大型语言模型（LLM），这包括揭示潜在机制并识别模型组件（如神经元和注意力头）以及模型抽象（如稀疏自编码器提取的稀疏特征）的作用。

Method: 本文对模型组件和抽象的概念描述领域进行了首次调查，概述了生成这些描述的关键方法，评估它们的自动化和人工指标，以及支持这项研究的数据集。

Result: 本文揭示了对更严格的因果评估的需求。

Conclusion: 本文通过概述现有技术并识别关键挑战，为未来研究提供了使模型更透明的路线图。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于高光谱单图像超分辨率(SISR)的新方法，旨在提高空间分辨率和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型难以在恢复精细空间细节的同时保持光谱保真度。

Method: 提出了光谱-空间解混融合(SSUF)模块，并结合自定义的空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该混合深度学习模型实现了有竞争力的性能，同时降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高高光谱图像超分辨率重建效果的同时，降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对幻觉的理解不完整且分散，提出的解决方案可能只缓解表面症状，而无法解决根本原因。

Method: 提出了一个统一的多层次框架，用于表征跨不同应用的图像和文本幻觉，并采用任务-模态交错的方法将这些幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 幻觉通常源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承的偏差。

Conclusion: 通过加深对幻觉的理解，为开发更强大、更有效的解决方案奠定基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型在真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性问题，发现现有方法主要关注简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察中出现的多模态扰动。作者提出了RobustVLA，通过离线鲁棒优化和跨输入变化的一致性动作来提高VLA模型对输入和输出扰动的鲁棒性。实验表明，RobustVLA在多个基准测试中都取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在真实世界扰动下鲁棒性不足，尤其是在动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动方面。现有方法主要关注简单的视觉扰动，忽略了更广泛的多模态扰动。

Method: 1. 评估主流VLA模型在四种模态的17种扰动下的鲁棒性。
2. 提出RobustVLA，通过离线鲁棒优化（对抗最坏情况的动作噪声）和跨输入变化的一致性动作来提高VLA模型对输入和输出扰动的鲁棒性。
3. 将鲁棒性建模为一个多臂赌博机问题，并应用上限置信边界算法来自动识别最有害的噪声。

Result: RobustVLA在LIBERO数据集上相对于基线模型取得了显著的性能提升，尤其是在pi0和OpenVLA骨干网络上。在真实世界的FR5机器人实验中，RobustVLA在四种模态的扰动下也取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: RobustVLA能够有效提高VLA模型在真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型(VLM)在基准测试中表现出色，但通过指令调整控制其行为仍然困难。我们引入了能力归因数据管理(CADC)，它将管理从任务特定的启发式方法转变为内在能力分析。利用梯度学习轨迹以无监督的方式发现内在能力，通过影响估计将训练数据归因于这些能力，并通过平衡选择和分阶段排序来管理能力感知课程。它将黑盒指令调整转变为可控的、能力驱动的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调整数据集预算的减少通常会导致性能下降，因为启发式策略将模型视为黑盒，并忽略了控制学习的潜在能力。

Method: Capability-Attributed Data Curation (CADC)

Result: 使用原始数据5%的情况下，CADC超越了多模态基准测试中的全数据训练。

Conclusion: 验证了内在能力是模型学习的基本组成部分，并将CADC确立为指令数据管理的主要范例。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准在任务设计上缺乏难度，并且在跨语言任务中存在不足。此外，现有的基准通常使用现实世界的图像，每个现实世界的图像通常包含一种文化，这使得这些基准对于MLLM来说相对容易。

Method: 构建了一个包含超过2000张图像和超过18000个QA对的C^3B基准，该基准包含三个难度递进的任务，从基本的视觉识别到更高层次的文化冲突理解，最后到文化内容生成。

Result: 对11个开源MLLM进行了评估，结果表明MLLM和人类表现之间存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: C^3B对当前的MLLM提出了巨大的挑战，鼓励未来的研究推进MLLM的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了六个最先进的开放权重文本到图像模型中的性别表征，发现它们在生成图像时会嵌入和放大社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像（TTI）模型越来越多地应用于专业、教育和创意环境，但它们的输出通常嵌入和放大社会偏见。本文旨在调查这些模型中存在的性别偏见问题。

Method: 使用精心设计的提示，针对五个医院相关职业（心脏病专家、医院院长、护士、护理人员、外科医生）和五个肖像修饰词，每个组合生成 100 张图像，以此来分析性别表示。

Result: 研究表明，所有模型都将护士完全生成为女性，而外科医生主要生成为男性。不同模型之间存在差异，并且肖像修饰词会进一步调节性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI 模型中的性别偏见既是系统性的，也是特定于模型的。提示词在塑造人口统计结果方面起着关键作用。需要进行偏差感知设计、平衡默认值和用户指南，以防止在生成式 AI 中强化职业刻板印象。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)中提示词交易市场的一个安全漏洞，即提示词本身可以被窃取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示词交易市场蓬勃发展，但提示词本身存在被窃取的安全风险，而这种风险在很大程度上未被 जांच。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的提示词反演框架RLStealer，该框架仅从一小部分示例图像中恢复其模板。RLStealer将模板窃取视为一个序列决策问题，并采用多个基于相似性的反馈信号作为奖励函数，以有效地探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准上的综合实验表明，RLStealer获得了最先进的性能，同时将总攻击成本降低到现有基线的13%以下。进一步的分析证实，RLStealer可以有效地推广到不同的图像风格，以有效地窃取未见过的提示词模板。

Conclusion: 本文的研究强调了提示词交易中固有的紧迫安全威胁，并为在新兴的MLLM市场中制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

Method: EDCT程序包括：(1) 获取模型的答案和NLE；(2) 将NLE解析为可测试的视觉概念；(3) 通过生成式图像修复生成有针对性的反事实编辑；(4) 使用LLM辅助分析答案和解释的变化，计算反事实一致性得分（CCS）。

Result: 在120个精心挑选的OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上，EDCT揭示了大量的忠实性差距。

Conclusion: EDCT提供与监管机构一致的审计工件，指示引用的概念何时未能通过因果测试。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HiDe的无训练框架，用于解决多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在高分辨率图像上表现不佳的问题。该框架通过解耦问题tokens并识别关键信息tokens，然后利用它们的注意力权重来实现与目标视觉区域的精确对齐，从而消除背景干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在高分辨率图像上的性能不佳，通常被认为是由于感知限制，即模型难以识别小物体。但本文分析表明，主要问题并非物体大小，而是由复杂的背景干扰引起的。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为分层解耦框架（HiDe）的无训练框架，该框架使用Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD)来解耦问题tokens并识别关键信息tokens，然后利用它们的注意力权重来实现与目标视觉区域的精确对齐。随后，它采用布局保留解耦（LPD）将这些区域与背景分离，并重建一个紧凑的表示，在保留基本空间布局的同时消除背景干扰。

Result: HiDe在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上创造了新的SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B提升到SOTA（在V*Bench上分别为92.1%和91.6%），甚至超过了RL方法。优化后，HiDe使用的内存比之前的无训练方法少75%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的HiDe框架能够有效解决多模态大型语言模型在高分辨率图像上由于背景干扰而导致的性能瓶颈，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，同时降低了内存消耗。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

TL;DR: FSDENet: Uses frequency and spatial domains for remote sensing image segmentation, improving edge clarity and handling grayscale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage spatial info, address semantic edge ambiguities from grayscale variations.

Method: Spatial processing for multi-scale features, FFT for global representations, Haar wavelet transform for edge refinement.

Result: SOTA results on LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID datasets.

Conclusion: Dual-domain synergy improves segmentation accuracy in boundary and grayscale transition zones.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统复杂且分阶段，缺乏统一性和效率。

Method: 提出 Max-V1 框架，使用单程生成范式，利用视觉语言模型的生成能力，通过统计建模得出监督策略，并通过模仿学习进行训练。

Result: 在 nuScenes 数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并且在跨域数据集上表现出卓越的泛化性能，与之前的基线相比，总体改进超过 30%。

Conclusion: Max-V1 模型能够实现基本的驾驶行为，为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的卷积神经网络（CNN）压缩设计空间探索（DSE）方法和框架，解决了低秩分解（LRF）在深度神经网络（DNN）压缩中面临的挑战，包括最佳秩选择、巨大的设计空间、长时间的微调以及与不同层类型和分解方法的有限兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩分解（LRF）压缩深度神经网络（DNN）技术面临最佳秩选择、设计空间巨大、微调时间长以及与不同层类型和分解方法兼容性有限等挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，并采用单次微调过程，集成了三种卷积层和三种全连接层的LRF技术，并在每层选择性地应用。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在实现了大幅压缩的同时，精度损失最小，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合多种LRF方法在一个模型中比在所有层上统一使用单一方法能产生更好的压缩效果，并对六种LRF技术进行了全面评估和比较，为它们在不同场景下的有效性提供了实践见解。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging

Motivation: 评估多模态大型语言模型在类似人类的单图像指南理解方面的能力。

Method: 开发了一个半自动标注流程，其中多个智能代理协同生成初步图像描述，以辅助人类构建图像-文本对。使用OIG-Bench对29个最先进的MLLM进行了综合评估。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B在评估的模型中表现最佳，总体准确率为77%。所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面都表现出明显的弱点。提出的多智能体标注系统在图像描述方面优于所有MLLM。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大型语言模型在准确解释复杂的视觉-文本关系方面仍然存在困难。多智能体标注系统具有作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Motivation: 为了在视觉语言模型中解锁地理空间推理，现有方法依赖于昂贵的领域预训练或监督微调。本文提出Geo-R1，旨在通过推理优先的后训练方法解决这个问题。

Method: Geo-R1 包含两个阶段：支架阶段，通过在合成的思维链示例上进行监督微调，灌输“地理空间思维模式”；提升阶段，在弱监督的跨视图配对代理上使用基于 GRPO 的强化学习。

Result: Geo-R1 在各种地理空间推理基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Geo-R1 将地理空间建模从领域预训练/监督微调扩展到推理优先的后训练。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Motivation: 当前鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化的问题，影响了紧致性和可扩展性。

Method: 1. 分析了层和神经元对输入扰动的稳定性和方差，提出了一个无偏和平滑神经元指标（USN）。2. 提出了一种新的神经元剪枝方法，移除USN低的神经元，保留USN高的神经元。3. 提出了新的Wasserstein距离损失，以确保剪枝后的神经元在层间更加集中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过剪枝减少了过参数化，提高了模型在亮度、对比度等扰动下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Motivation: 高光谱异常检测（HAD）是许多民用和军事应用的关键方法，旨在识别具有相对于大量背景特征而言异常的光谱特征的像素。已经做出了巨大的努力来改进HAD技术，但是由于复杂的现实世界环境以及定义上对潜在感兴趣特征的先验知识有限，因此出现了挑战。

Method: 本文通过提出一种基于传输的数学模型来描述组成给定高光谱图像的像素，从而引入了一种新颖的HAD方法。在这种方法中，高光谱像素被视为对经历未知变形的模板模式的观察，从而可以在有符号累积分布变换（SCDT）域中表示它们。然后，使用无监督子空间建模技术来构建此域中丰富背景信号的模型，从而将异常信号检测为与学习模型之间的偏差。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上进行的全面评估表明，与最新方法相比，我们的方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的高光谱异常检测方法，并在五个数据集上验证了其有效性，结果表明该方法优于目前最好的方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 检测合成生成的图像并将其归因于特定来源的能力是一个紧迫的问题。现有的水印方法存在对真实失真脆弱、易于自适应移除以及当底层水印密钥改变时更新成本高等问题。

Method: 该框架将编码问题定义为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动。论文引入了一种基于路由的实例化方法，称为混合 LoRA 标记 (MOLM)，其中二元密钥激活残差和注意力块内的轻量级 LoRA 适配器。

Result: 在 Stable Diffusion 和 FLUX 上的实验表明，MOLM 在保持图像质量的同时，实现了对失真、压缩和再生、平均攻击以及提取器上的黑盒对抗攻击的鲁棒密钥恢复。

Conclusion: MOLM 能够在生成模型中嵌入鲁棒且可验证的水印，同时保持图像质量和抵抗各种攻击。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的开放世界目标检测框架CROWD，它可以持续发现和整合未知物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放世界目标检测方法经常受到已知和未知类别之间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘的影响，导致未知召回率降低和已知类别精度下降。

Method: CROWD将未知物体发现和适应重新定义为一个相互交织的组合（基于集合）的数据发现（CROWD-Discover）和表示学习（CROWD-Learn）任务。CROWD-Discover通过最大化子模条件增益（SCG）函数来战略性地挖掘未知实例，选择与已知对象明显不同的代表性示例。随后，CROWD-Learn采用新的组合目标，共同解开已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别之间的判别一致性，从而减轻混淆和遗忘。

Result: 在OWOD基准上的大量评估表明，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上的已知类别精度分别提高了2.83%和2.05%，并且与领先的基线相比，未知召回率提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD可以有效提高开放世界目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了有监督轻量级卷积神经网络 (CNN) 和最先进的零样本医学视觉语言模型 (VLM) BiomedCLIP 在肺炎和肺结核检测中的性能。结果表明，通过决策阈值校准，BiomedCLIP 的性能显著提高，甚至可以超过有监督的 CNN。

Motivation: 在医学影像中，使用自动化方法准确解释胸部 X 光片至关重要。

Method: 本文比较了有监督轻量级 CNN 和零样本医学 VLM BiomedCLIP 在肺炎和肺结核检测中的性能，并通过在验证集上优化分类阈值来校准 BiomedCLIP 的决策阈值。

Result: 对于肺炎检测，校准后的零样本 VLM 的 F1 分数为 0.8841，超过了有监督 CNN 的 0.8803。对于肺结核检测，校准后的 F1 分数从 0.4812 提高到 0.7684，接近有监督基线的 0.7834。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于充分利用零样本 VLM 的诊断能力至关重要，使其能够与高效的、特定于任务的有监督模型相匹配甚至超越。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PAL-UI的新框架，该框架使GUI代理能够在需要时自适应地检索过去的观察结果，从而显著优于移动GUI导航任务中的baseline模型和先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么截断历史记录，要么依赖简单的文本摘要，当过去的视觉细节对于未来的决策变得必要时，这有失去关键信息的风险。

Method: PAL-UI结合了双层摘要代理（捕获观察级别的线索和行动级别的结果）和一个专用检索工具，该工具允许代理在计划期间回忆起特定的历史屏幕截图。

Result: PAL-UI在移动GUI导航任务中显著优于baseline模型和先前方法，即使在数据效率设置下也是如此。此外，PAL-UI表现出强大的跨领域泛化能力，无需额外训练即可在Web导航中实现显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了主动记忆检索对于基于视觉的GUI代理的长期规划能力的潜力。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

TL;DR: 开发了一个专门用于脑膜瘤放疗计划的交互式医学图像分割 (IMIS) 工具，名为 Interactive-MEN-RT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确描绘脑膜瘤对于有效的放疗 (RT) 计划至关重要，直接影响治疗效果和保护邻近的健康组织。虽然自动深度学习方法已显示出相当大的潜力，但由于肿瘤异质性，实现始终准确的临床分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了一个专门的 IMIS 工具 Interactive-MEN-RT，用于临床医生辅助的 3D 脑膜瘤分割，集成了多种临床相关的交互方法，包括点注释、边界框、套索工具和涂鸦，从而增强了可用性和临床精度。

Result: 在涉及来自 BraTS 2025 脑膜瘤 RT 分割挑战赛的 500 份对比增强 T1 加权 MRI 扫描的评估中，与其它分割方法相比，Interactive-MEN-RT 表现出显著的改进，Dice 相似系数高达 77.6%，交并比 (IoU) 分数为 64.8%。

Conclusion: 在脑膜瘤放疗计划等关键应用中，需要临床定制的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BindWeave是一个统一的框架，可以处理各种subject-to-video的场景，从单subject的案例到具有异构实体的复杂多subject场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型在生成subject一致的视频方面仍然不足，这是因为它们难以解析指定复杂空间关系、时间逻辑以及多个subject之间交互的prompt。

Method: 我们提出了MLLM-DiT框架，其中预训练的多模态大型语言模型执行深度跨模态推理，以确定实体并解开角色、属性和交互，从而产生subject感知的隐藏状态，这些状态调节diffusion transformer以实现高保真subject一致的视频生成。

Result: 在OpenS2V基准测试上的实验表明，我们的方法在生成的视频中的subject一致性、自然性和文本相关性方面取得了优异的性能，优于现有的开源和商业模型。

Conclusion: BindWeave在subject一致性、自然性和文本相关性方面优于现有模型，解决了视频生成模型难以解析复杂prompt的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自监督去噪方法SCNet，用于处理成对的噪声图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督去噪方法存在高频细节保留不足和学习高频噪声的问题。

Method: 1. 提出频率带选择策略以加速训练收敛；2. 提出参数优化方法，使用Lipschitz常数限制卷积核学习高频噪声；3. 引入SSR模块，通过频域分离和低秩空间重构分离噪声和高频细节。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性。

Conclusion: SCNet有效地解决了成对噪声图像自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和高频噪声学习问题。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA框架通过密集提议重叠和图像条件提示评分来提高零样本物体检测器在域漂移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言物体检测器(VLODs)在域漂移下性能下降。

Method: 提出IoU加权熵目标，集中调整空间连贯的提议聚类，减少孤立框的确认偏差；引入图像条件提示选择，通过图像级别兼容性对提示进行排序，并将信息量最大的提示与检测器logits融合。

Result: 在各种分布偏移（包括风格化领域、驾驶场景、弱光条件和常见损坏）上的基准测试表明，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO两个最先进的VLOD上有效，并且相对于零样本和TTA基线有持续的改进。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架有效地提高了视觉语言物体检测器在域漂移下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Motivation: 现有模型在视觉和符号的组合推理方面存在局限性。

Method: 该基准测试包含文本引导和纯视觉设置，涵盖数字尺度、移动复杂性、解决方案多样性和运算符变化等。

Result: 对14个视觉语言模型的评估表明，闭源模型仅在简单情况下成功，开源模型在视觉领域失败，而人类的准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks是一个严格的测试平台，可以促进视觉和符号之间的组合推理。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用异常检测框架，该框架利用正常和异常样本作为参考来指导跨域异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的通用异常检测方法主要使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了异常样本中包含的有价值的信息。

Method: 提出了 Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) 框架，由残差挖掘 (RM) 和异常特征学习 (AFL) 两个关键组件组成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，该方法明显优于现有的 GAD 方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了首次在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本的混合作为参考。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RAF(Relative-Absolute Fusion)的特征提取技术，旨在提高基于图像的选择方法的选择精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏线性系统的迭代方法选择至关重要，因为这些方法本身缺乏稳健性。虽然基于图像的选择方法显示出前景，但它们的特征提取技术可能会将不同的矩阵编码成相同的图像表示，从而导致相同的选择和次优的方法。

Method: 同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及相应的数值作为绝对特征，实现全面的矩阵表示，防止不同矩阵之间的特征模糊。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的综合评估表明，稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统的基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，并实现了最先进的(SOTA)性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过同时提取相对和绝对特征，实现了全面的矩阵表示，解决了特征模糊问题，提高了选择精度，并解锁了基于图像的选择方法的潜力。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的手部姿势重建方法，该方法利用了手与物体交互的文本描述信息，通过扩散模型生成更合理的手部姿势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时，很难重建3D手部姿势。人类通常会利用上下文知识来解决这些歧义，例如物体提供的可供性。

Method: 该方法使用了一个基于扩散的生成模型，该模型学习在可供性描述条件下合理的手部姿势分布。可供性描述是从大型视觉-语言模型（VLM）中推断出来的。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的大量实验表明，与最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的细化方法相比，我们的可供性引导细化显着提高了手部姿势估计。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用可供性引导的手部姿势重建方法，该方法在严重遮挡的情况下表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Result: 大量的实验表明，该框架具有卓越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的渐进学习框架，可以提高多模态大模型的效率，同时保持其性能。

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench is introduced as a standardized benchmark for echocardiography foundation models (FMs) due to the lack of standardized evaluation and unique challenges in echocardiography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing echocardiography FMs lack standardized benchmarks and are often evaluated on private data, limiting comparability. Echocardiography has unique challenges like noisy data and limited public datasets.

Method: CardioBench unifies eight public datasets into a standardized suite with regression and classification tasks. Several FMs are evaluated using zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols.

Result: The results show complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling for functional regression, retrieval for robustness, and domain-specific text encoders for capturing physiological axes. General-purpose encoders transfer well but struggle with fine-grained distinctions.

Conclusion: CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers insights for designing future echocardiography FMs by releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于3D手部姿势重建的由粗到精的级联扩散框架，该框架结合了概率建模和级联细化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性模型难以解决由自遮挡和复杂的手部关节运动引起的姿势模糊性，而现有的概率方法又局限于单阶段估计，无法在没有细化的情况下产生准确的3D重建。

Method: 第一阶段是联合扩散模型，对不同的3D关节假设进行采样；第二阶段是网格潜在扩散模型（Mesh LDM），该模型重建以关节样本为条件的3D手部网格。通过在学习的潜在空间中使用不同的关节假设来训练Mesh LDM，我们的框架学习了具有分布意识的关节-网格关系和强大的手部先验。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2上的实验表明，我们的方法实现了最先进的性能，同时有效地建模了姿势分布。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了概率建模和级联细化，有效地解决了3D手部姿势重建中的姿势模糊性和准确性问题。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用数据高效的基础模型来减少霉菌菌落计数任务中对手动标注数据的依赖的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化培养皿样本上的霉菌菌落对于评估室内空气质量至关重要，但传统方法依赖于耗时的人工标注和大量训练。

Method: 使用包含 5000 个培养皿图像的数据集，通过模拟传统数据收集方法以及少样本和低样本场景，对三个视觉基础模型进行了基准测试。

Result: MaskDINO 在仅用 150 张图像进行微调后，就达到了与经过广泛训练的 YoloV9 模型几乎相同的水平，并且在仅使用 25 张图像时仍保持了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型可以用所需数据的一小部分匹配传统方法，从而能够更早地开发和更快地迭代改进自动化微生物系统，并且具有比传统模型更高的上限性能。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于低秩适配(LoRA)的混合专家(MoE)中的自适应共享专家(ASE)，以解决从单任务学习(STL)到多任务学习(MTL)的过渡中的冗余适配和知识共享效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE-MTL方法通常依赖于单任务预训练的主干网络，并且在从STL到MTL的过渡过程中存在冗余适配和知识共享效率低下的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE中提出自适应共享专家(ASE)，其中共享专家被分配路由器计算的门控权重，这些权重与稀疏专家联合归一化。此外，通过增加LoRA专家的数量同时按比例降低它们的秩来合并细粒度专家。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准上进行的广泛实验表明，在统一的训练设置下，ASE在不同的配置中持续提高性能，并验证了细粒度设计对于MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE有效地促进了STL到MTL的过渡，增强了专家 специализацию 和协作，并且细粒度的专家设计在可比较的参数预算下实现了更有效的知识共享。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: Existing generative VFI methods are constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration.

Result: ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: ArbInterp enables efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

*Zesheng Li,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Jianwei Guo,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的NeRF风格迁移方法，可以在保留内容的同时进行艺术风格化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息集成到原始的NeRF流程中，导致内容保留和艺术风格化效果欠佳

Method: 重新设计了NeRF流程，专门用于风格化，并结合了创新的动态风格注入模块。提出了一个多层次特征适配器，有助于从内容辐射场生成多层次特征网格表示，有效地捕捉场景的多尺度空间结构。此外，还提出了一个动态风格注入模块，学习提取相关的风格特征，并自适应地将其整合到内容模式中。风格化的多层次特征通过我们提出的多层次级联解码器转换成最终的风格化视图。此外，我们还扩展了我们的3D风格迁移方法，以支持使用3D风格参考的全方位视图风格迁移

Result: MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面取得了出色的性能，在保留多尺度空间结构的同时有效地转移了风格特征

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面取得了出色的性能

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADPT的自动缺陷标注框架，无需人工干预即可将原始视觉数据转换为高质量、语义标记的缺陷数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注结构缺陷成本高、效率低。

Method: 该框架集成了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）、语义模式匹配模块和迭代自问精炼机制。

Result: 在类别平衡设置下，区分缺陷图像和非缺陷图像的准确率高达 98%，在四个缺陷类别中的标注准确率为 85%-98%；在类别不平衡的数据集上，准确率为 80%-92%。

Conclusion: 该框架为高保真数据集构建提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域自适应等下游任务提供强大的支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种共识驱动的在线特征增强策略 (COFA)，利用前景和背景特征来促进可导航的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然增强多方面的视觉表征推动了 VLN 的进步，但视觉观察中前景和背景的重要性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 利用语义增强的地标识别来分离前景和背景作为候选增强特征。 随后，一种共识驱动的在线增强策略鼓励代理根据不同的指令和导航位置整合关于特征偏好的两阶段投票结果。

Result: 在 REVERIE 和 R2R 上的实验表明，我们的在线前景-背景增强提高了基线的泛化能力，并获得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的共识驱动的在线特征增强策略，通过显式地分离和利用前景与背景信息，提升了视觉语言导航任务中的agent的泛化能力，并在实验中取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [90] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 RCOR（鲁棒上下文感知对象识别）的方法，该方法能够同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知，而不会影响任何一方。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的监督学习经常导致过度依赖背景（BG），即对虚假相关的捷径学习，从而限制了模型在现实部署环境中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决这个问题，牺牲上下文信息以提高泛化能力。

Method: RCOR 将定位视为识别的一个组成部分，以解耦以对象为中心的建模和上下文感知的建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR 提高了有监督模型和 VLM 在具有域内和域外 BG 的数据集上的性能，即使没有微调。结果证实，即使在像 ImageNet-1k 这样的复杂场景中，在识别之前进行定位现在也是可能的。

Conclusion: RCOR 是一种有效的方法，可以在不牺牲上下文信息的情况下提高模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用无条件判别器 (UCD) 的 GAN 训练方法，以提高性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN 训练难以收敛且容易出现模式崩溃，因为有条件输入会禁用有意义的知识提取。

Method: 采用无条件判别器 (UCD)，强制 D 提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，而不注入任何条件。

Result: 在 ImageNet-64 数据集上实现了 1.47 的 FID，超过了 StyleGAN-XL 和其他最先进的单步扩散模型。

Conclusion: UCD 可以在插件方式中实现，并且可以显著提高性能和效率。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该数据集为超越目录式生成，迈向反映创造力、氛围和故事讲述的时尚图像的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的方法在处理伪造图像的高度复杂和非线性伪影方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 使用KAN替换固定激活函数，并引入LAKAN模块，利用面部关键点动态生成KAN的内部参数，引导图像编码器关注包含伪影的最重要的面部区域。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在Deepfake人脸检测中表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Method: ReFlux通过逆向注意力优化策略重新激活被抑制的信号，并通过速度引导动态和一致性保持目标来增强概念重新激活的鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验证明了所提出的攻击方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估修正流transformer中概念擦除策略的鲁棒性建立了一个可靠的基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Result: 通过在各种用例中演示ToolBrain，例如训练CodeAct代理自主执行电子邮件搜索任务，结果表明工具使用技能得到了快速、有针对性的改进（高达30.0%）。

Conclusion: ToolBrain提供了一个简单且可扩展的代码库，可以有效提升Agentic AI中工具的使用效率。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

*Dongqi Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自适应推理抑制（ARS）的免训练方法，该方法通过自适应确定性监控动态抑制冗余推理步骤，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效推理方法面临着平衡推理质量与推理成本降低的挑战，大型推理语言模型（LRLM 或 LRM）在复杂推理任务中表现出卓越的能力，但由于过度思考现象而导致计算效率低下。

Method: ARS 引入了一种具有渐进抑制阈值的多检查点确定性估计机制，与静态抑制方法相比，实现了更高的效率。

Result: 在多个模型架构上使用数学推理基准进行的广泛评估表明，ARS 在 token、延迟和能源减少方面分别达到了高达 53%、46.1% 和 57.9%，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS 是一种有效的方法，可以在保持或提高准确性的同时，显著降低大型推理语言模型的计算成本。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeurIPS应该积极促进关于人工智能策略的科学共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的证据生成机制和初步的证据综合机制之间存在空白，缺乏共识形成机制。

Method: 建议NeurIPS通过借鉴IPCC的经验，进行初步试验，以建立关于气候政策的科学共识。

Result: 反驳了人工智能研究人员意见分歧过大以及政策参与不属于NeurIPS业务范围的观点。

Conclusion: NeurIPS在人工智能领域处于领先地位，应该倡导科学共识，以制定更高质量的人工智能策略。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（VLM）在保释决策预测任务中的应用，发现其性能较差，并可能错误地拒绝应得保释的个人，即使模型有很高的置信度。通过引入法律先例和微调VLM，可以显著提高保释预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法律判决预测系统主要依赖于案例报告和犯罪历史等文本信息。随着大型视觉语言模型（VLM）的兴起，可以将罪犯的图像信息纳入法律判决预测系统。然而，这种做法可能会产生意想不到的后果，并可能被恶意利用。

Method: 本文通过对多个交叉群体和模型的独立VLM进行审计，评估其在保释决策预测任务中的效率。然后，设计不同的干预算法，包括通过RAG流程引入法律先例，并使用创新方案对VLM进行微调。

Result: 结果表明，VLM在保释决策预测任务中的性能较差，并且可能错误地拒绝应得保释的个人，即使模型有很高的置信度。通过引入法律先例和微调VLM，可以显著提高保释预测的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在VLM上设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路，以防止它们被部署到现实世界的法律判决预测中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的金融欺诈检测具有挑战性，因为证据分散在多年财务披露中。

Method: 该方法整合了主体风险先验、混合检索策略和专用代理模块，以识别和聚合跨报告证据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在召回率和可解释性方面均优于通用代理模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了领域特定推理和数据集构建对于推进实际金融欺诈检测的价值。

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

Motivation: 传统方法无法预测大量现实世界的意外事件，并且很快变得不完整。具身人工智能可以提供常识推理来评估环境并实时生成适当的行动。

Method: 在Unreal Engine模拟城市基准中，无人机动态地解释周围环境，并决定进行安全着陆的突然机动。

Result: 具身人工智能使一类新的自适应恢复和决策管道成为可能，这些管道以前通过手工设计是不可行的。

Conclusion: 具身人工智能提高了自主空中系统的弹性和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Method: 通过神经 Slot Attention (SA) 组件进行目标中心学习，并结合 Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR) 进行符号推理。

Result: SAA-CBR 在 CLEVR-Hans 数据集上表现出有效的分类性能，与基线模型相比具有竞争性。

a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline for image classification that integrates
object-centric learning via a neural Slot Attention (SA) component with

### [104] [Thinkquel: A Model Dedicated to Text-to-dbt Using Synthetic Data and a Span-Aware Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00186)
*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel，一个用于生成健壮、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询的微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠的、可用于生产的数据转换仍然具有挑战性：正确性取决于精确的模式链接和特定于仓库的 SQL 方言，而训练期间可用的最强监督——执行成功和结果匹配——仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型的、经过执行验证的语料库成本高昂，并且 token 级别的目标与这些全局信号不一致，从而导致不稳定的优化和有限的可移植性。

Method: Thinkquel 集成了新颖的合成数据管道 TS-SQL，该管道利用 dbt 作为可移植的中间表示，具有跨度感知强化学习目标和 Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO)，专门用于弥合 token 级别训练信号和序列级别执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在 500 个示例的 TS-SQL 测试集上，Thinkquel (32B) 通过两阶段 SFT 课程实现了 93.2% 的执行成功率和 61.8% 的精确结果匹配，比基础模型提高了 67.2%（执行）和 44.4%（匹配）。在 Spider (14B) 实验中，相对于 GRPO 和 GSPO，TS-GRPO 提高了训练稳定性并加快了执行匹配奖励的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了 Thinkquel，一个用于生成健壮、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询的微调模型，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Motivation: 探讨利用社交媒体平台进行抑郁症严重程度检测。

Method: 提出了一种名为AttentionDep的领域感知注意力模型，该模型融合了上下文和领域知识，通过unigrams和bigrams分层编码帖子，并结合来自心理健康知识图谱的领域知识，使用序数回归框架预测抑郁症严重程度。

Result: AttentionDep在分级F1评分方面优于现有最佳模型超过5%，并能提供可解释的预测。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了从社交媒体进行心理健康评估的可信和透明的AI系统的开发。

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为“解耦微调”的新方法，用于提高本地大型语言模型在工具调用场景中的性能。该方法将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，并为每个子任务创建独立的LoRA适配器。此外，论文还提出了DualTune推理框架，利用这些适配器在终端设备上高效地进行agent编排。实验结果表明，该方法可以显著提高本地模型的工具调用准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在任务自动化中，使用大型语言模型作为agent编排器已经引发了革命，但对保护隐私、具有成本效益的解决方案的需求需要设备上的推理能力。然而，在工具调用场景中，本地大型语言模型的性能始终低于前沿模型，难以从大型工具集中选择工具，也难以生成复杂参数结构的准确参数。

Method: 该论文提出了一种将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个不同子任务的方法。论文提出“解耦微调”，这是一种新颖的后训练方法，它采用LoRA微调来创建专用的LoRA适配器，用于工具选择和特定于工具的参数生成，并为每个子任务使用单独的损失掩蔽。此外，论文还提出了DualTune，一个推理框架，它利用使用解耦微调创建的LoRA适配器，在最终用户设备的本地模型的帮助下，执行高效的代理编排。DualTune将工具调用生成步骤分解为工具选择和参数生成，并动态加载相应的LoRA适配器以生成工具调用。此外，DualTune还实现了分层编排，以限制工具选择所需的工具数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试上的实验表明，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，并且在所有情况下都优于其他类似大小的本地推理、非推理和微调模型，并且在大多数情况下优于大2倍的模型。

Conclusion: 该研究成果表明，通过解耦微调和DualTune框架，可以有效提升本地大型语言模型在工具调用任务中的性能，使其在隐私保护和成本效益方面更具优势。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为MAGIC-MASK的框架，用于提高多智能体强化学习的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释性方法在计算成本、探索覆盖范围和多智能体适应性方面存在局限性。

Method: 该方法通过集成近端策略优化、自适应epsilon-greedy探索和轻量级智能体间协作来共享masked状态信息和经验。

Result: MAGIC-MASK在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面优于现有技术水平，同时提供可解释和可转移的解释。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的数学形式将可解释性从单智能体推广到多智能体系统，从而产生基于概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程的局部、可解释的解释。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

TL;DR: ICL guides improve task-specific performance but degrade cross-domain reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the impact of ICL guides on cross-domain cognitive abilities of LLMs.

Method: Using six variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model with different ICL configurations, the models were tested on general knowledge, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem, followed by statistical analysis (ANOVA).

Result: ICL models showed high accuracy on general knowledge but degraded performance on complex reasoning problems. No significant differences were observed on the olympiad problem.

Conclusion: ICL guides create trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, which has implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的代理在选择外部工具时存在偏差，影响用户体验和市场竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究工具选择中的公平性问题，避免模型过度偏向特定提供商。

Method: 构建包含多个功能等效工具的基准，评估工具选择偏差，并通过受控实验 जांच偏差的来源。

Result: 发现模型存在偏向单一提供商或优先选择列表中较早工具的倾向；查询与元数据之间的语义对齐是选择的关键因素；扰动描述会显著改变选择；重复的预训练暴露会加剧偏差。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏差是工具增强型LLM公平部署的关键障碍，提出了一种轻量级缓解方法，即先过滤候选工具到相关子集，然后均匀采样，以减少偏差并保持良好的任务覆盖率。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA是一个基准，用于揭示人工智能评估中的一个关键盲点：最先进的模型无法在对抗性的高风险环境中运行，在这些环境中，虚假信息被武器化，错误是不可逆转的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准衡量在受控环境中完成任务的情况，但现实世界的部署需要抵御主动欺骗。使用加密货币市场作为一个试验台，2024年有300亿美元因漏洞而损失，我们评估了17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现，这些任务要求代理区分真相和操纵，在分散的信息环境中导航，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆转的财务决策。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为试验台，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现。

Result: 结果显示，即使是前沿模型，在没有工具的情况下，任务准确率也只有28%，而初级分析师通常可以处理这些任务。工具增强提高了性能，但停滞在67.4%，而人类基线为80%，尽管可以无限制地访问专业资源。最关键的是，我们发现了一个系统的工具选择灾难：模型优先选择不可靠的网络搜索而不是权威数据，从而陷入SEO优化的虚假信息和社交媒体操纵。

Conclusion: CAIA的意义超越了加密货币，延伸到任何有积极对手的领域，例如网络安全、内容审核等。我们发布了CAIA，具有污染控制和持续更新，将对抗性鲁棒性确立为可信赖的人工智能自主的必要条件。该基准表明，当前的模型，尽管具有令人印象深刻的推理分数，但在智能必须在积极对抗中生存的环境中，仍然没有做好充分的准备。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在自然语言处理中表现出色，但在逻辑推理方面存在困难。这可能是由于缺乏对latent space和recurrent reasoning等更具创造性的应用的探索。

Method: 本文对Hierarchical Reasoning Model进行 критический обзор, 检验了关键设计选择, 并提出了改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察结果和未来研究的有趣方向。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Method: 提出语义驱动的AI代理通信框架，并开发三种技术：1) 语义自适应传输，通过微调模型以适应变化的环境；2) 语义轻量传输，通过剪枝、量化和感知采样来降低模型复杂性；3) 语义自进化控制，采用分布式分层决策来优化资源。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的agent评估基准测试很容易达到性能上限，难以评估agent的真实能力。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：演化提议挖掘、问题形成和自由探索、多层次验证。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试上的实验表明，TRACE框架可以持续提高任务的复杂性，并通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: TRACE框架将静态基准测试转变为动态、自我演化的评估系统，为agent的发展提供了可持续且具有挑战性的平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前评估自由文本人工智能回复的金标准——人工专家评审—— labor-intensive 且缓慢，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标有前景，但与人类判断的对齐程度不同，而且通常依赖于上下文。

Method: 我们对评估方法进行了一项大型系统研究。在 100 个患者案例中，我们收集了 28 个人工智能系统的回复（总共 2800 个），并从三个维度评估它们：系统回复是否 (1) 回答了问题，(2) 适当地使用了临床笔记证据，以及 (3) 使用了一般的医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案来锚定指标。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评级密切相关。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展人工智能系统的比较评估，并支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的状态表示方法，即扩展决策状态（EDMS），它将原始位置和速度与关系变量（例如，空间、传球和得分）的分数相结合，并结合动作掩蔽方案，为有球和无球的agent提供不同的决策集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析方法依赖规则，而机器学习模型缺乏明确的agent表示，导致难以进行量化战术分析。

Method: 提出Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS)，一种语义丰富的状态表示，它用关系变量增强原始位置和速度，并结合动作掩蔽方案。

Result: 实验表明，与基线相比，EDMS与动作掩蔽相结合，始终降低了动作预测损失和时间差（TD）误差。案例研究和Q值可视化表明，EDMS突出了高风险、高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS能够将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念，并使agent的选择与比赛规则保持一致。该方法已集成到开源库中，并与多个商业和开放数据集兼容，从而可以进行跨提供商评估和可重复的实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLM）在测试时扩展期间的可靠性评估方法进行了研究，比较了四种奖励模型变体（判别式 ORM 和 PRM，以及生成式 ORM 和 PRM）在 14 个不同领域上的表现，发现生成式结果奖励模型（GenORM）是最稳健的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作普遍认为，过程奖励模型（PRM）优于结果奖励模型（ORM），但这一观点主要基于狭窄的、与数学相关的领域。本文旨在对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估，并挑战先前关于细粒度监督总是更好的假设。

Method: 本文对四种奖励模型变体（判别式 ORM 和 PRM，以及生成式 ORM 和 PRM）在 14 个不同领域上进行了评估和比较。此外，本文还进行了理论分析，以解释 PRM 风格的逐步评分为何会累积误差。

Result: 本文发现，判别式 ORM 与判别式 PRM 表现相当，生成式 PRM 不具竞争力，而总体而言，生成式 ORM 是最稳健的，在每个测试领域都产生了显著且一致的收益。作者认为，这是由于 PRM 风格的逐步评分会继承来自 LLM 自动标记的标签噪声，并且难以评估长的推理轨迹，包括涉及自我纠正推理的轨迹。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果挑战了先前关于细粒度监督总是更好的假设，并支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为VIRTUE的新型视觉交互文本图像通用嵌入器，它扩展了分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力到表征学习领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法根据用户的兴趣区域进行指定，这限制了它们在人机交互应用中的潜力。同时，视觉交互能力也有助于模型学习图像中的实体级别信息，以补充其全局表征。

Method: 该方法结合了分割模型和视觉语言模型，允许模型处理视觉提示，精确定位图像中的特定区域。

Result: VIRTUE在36个通用MMEB任务和5个视觉交互SCaR任务上都取得了显著的性能提升，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: VIRTUE通过引入视觉交互能力，显著提升了嵌入模型在各种任务上的性能，并为新的应用场景打开了大门。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Motivation: 现有的数据质量框架不足以解决RAG系统的动态性和多阶段性问题。

Method: 通过对IT服务公司从业者的16次访谈进行内容分析。

Result: 提出了15个数据质量维度，并发现新维度集中在RAG的早期阶段，质量问题会在RAG流程中传播。

Conclusion: 需要动态的、分阶段的数据质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

Motivation: 揭示DLM具有一个源于其迭代去噪过程的关键漏洞，并提出一种对策。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的针对dlm的安全对齐方法，该方法训练模型从包含肯定tokens的受污染的中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著地缓解了漏洞，且对任务性能的影响最小。此外，该方法提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作强调了对特定于dlm的安全研究的需要。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Agent Context Optimization (ACON) 的通用框架，用于压缩agent在动态、真实环境中的上下文信息，减少内存使用并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用作动态、真实环境中的agent，但长期任务中不断增长的上下文长度带来了成本和效率问题。

Method: ACON通过自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化，将环境观察和交互历史压缩成简洁但信息丰富的摘要。利用大型语言模型分析压缩失败的原因，并相应更新压缩指南。此外，还将优化后的LLM压缩器提炼成更小的模型。

Result: ACON 减少了 26-54% 的内存使用（峰值 tokens），同时基本保持了任务性能，当提炼成更小的压缩器时，保持了 95% 以上的准确率，并提高了小型 LM 作为长期 agent 的性能，高达 46%。

Conclusion: ACON 是一种有效的上下文压缩框架，可以显著减少内存使用，同时保持或提高 agent 在长期任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

TL;DR: HARPA addresses the challenges of generating testable and grounded hypotheses in automated scientific discovery by incorporating a human-inspired ideation workflow. It identifies research trends, explores hypothesis design spaces, and converges on precise hypotheses by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated scientific discovery tools struggle to generate testable and literature-grounded hypotheses and are not adaptive to prior experimental outcomes.

Method: HARPA incorporates a human-inspired ideation workflow: identifying research trends through literature mining, exploring hypothesis design spaces, and converging on testable hypotheses. It also learns a reward model based on prior experimental outcomes.

Result: HARPA-generated proposals perform comparably to a strong baseline in most qualitative dimensions but significantly improve feasibility and groundedness. It also leads to more successful executions and fewer failures when tested with the ASD agent. HARPA's reward model improves hypothesis scoring based on prior experimental outcomes.

Conclusion: HARPA represents a step forward in AI-driven scientific discovery by generating more testable and grounded hypotheses and adapting to prior experimental outcomes.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 当前的模型编辑研究存在虚假成功，因为模型利用了捷径而非真正的语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型不可避免地包含过时或不正确的知识，更新、删除和遗忘这些知识对于对齐和安全至关重要。模型编辑旨在通过精确编辑一小部分参数来更新特定事实，同时保留其他知识。

Method: 系统地开发了一套新的评估方法，以揭示模型编辑中的问题。

Result: 发现现有最佳方法在最简单的否定查询下也会崩溃。编辑可能基于捷径而非完整的语义。

Conclusion: 在进一步有意义地推进之前，需要紧急重新考虑模型编辑的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为协同蒸馏扩散模型（CDDM）的新方法，用于实时和轻量级的轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型较大且采样过程缓慢，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: CDDM基于协同渐进蒸馏（CPD），将知识从高容量教师扩散模型逐步转移到轻量级学生模型，共同减少了采样步骤和模型大小。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，以结合来自教师和真实数据的指导，减轻潜在的过拟合。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人和nuScenes车辆基准测试中，CDDM实现了最先进的预测精度。良好蒸馏的CDDM在行人轨迹上保留了baseline模型96.2%和95.5%的ADE和FDE性能，同时只需要231K参数和4或2个采样步骤，相当于161倍压缩，31倍加速和9毫秒延迟。

Conclusion: CDDM将高性能生成模型与实际部署约束联系起来，为AV和ITS实现了资源高效的概率预测。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是有效的大型语言模型推理的主要瓶颈。基于注意力分数的KV缓存修剪面临实际限制：未来的token的注意力分数在压缩期间不可用，并且像Flash Attention这样的现代实现不会实现完整的注意力矩阵，从而无法访问过去的分数。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭合形式计算每个KV对的预期注意力分数，从而估计KV对的重要性。

Result: 在预填充和解码阶段始终优于最先进的基线，在不降低性能的情况下实现有效的压缩。

Conclusion: 发布KVPress，这是一个全面的库，使研究人员能够实施和评估KV缓存压缩方法，其中已经包含20多种技术。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健等高风险领域，准确的解释与精度同样重要，因此理解深度学习模型的内部运作至关重要。

Result: Batch-CAM在提高准确性和图像重建质量的同时，减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: 通过确保模型从证据相关的信息中学习，该方法为构建更透明、可解释和值得信赖的AI系统做出了相关贡献。

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种迭代相关区域（RZ）缩减方法，以减小博弈求解中的搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AlphaZero等方法在博弈中表现出超人类水平，但由于博弈树的指数增长，许多博弈仍未解决。相关区域（RZ）是一种局部策略重用技术，但RZ并非唯一，较小的RZ通常更有利。

Method: 该方法通过重复求解同一位置，同时逐渐限制相关区域，引导求解器找到更小的RZ。设计了三种约束生成策略，并集成了一个RZ模式表，以充分利用过去的解决方案。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go上的实验表明，该方法将平均RZ大小降低到原来的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的RZ可以永久存储为可重用的知识，用于未来的求解任务，特别是在更大的棋盘尺寸或不同的开局中。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的策略优化算法存在局限性，例如静态训练计划和近端策略优化(ppo)中严格的统一剪裁机制。

Method: 该方法采用双组件自适应学习策略：动态课程，通过逐步增加样本重用来协调从稳定、近策略探索阶段到高效、离策略利用阶段的原理性过渡；优势感知自适应剪裁(aaac)机制，用动态的、样本相关的边界取代固定的剪裁超参数，这些边界由每个token的标准化优势调节。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态推理基准测试套件(包括mathvista、logicvista和mmmu-pro)上进行了大量的实验。结果表明，acpo始终优于dapo和papo等强大的基线，实现了最先进的性能、加速的收敛和卓越的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: acpo在复杂推理任务中优于现有方法，提高了性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的数据增强管道，旨在提高大型语言模型在形式定理证明中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM在形式定理证明中缺乏泛化能力，并且对问题陈述的微小转换很敏感。

Method: 该管道从对称性和难度两个角度进行增强：EvolAST和EvolDomain处理对称性，EvolDifficulty处理难度。

Result: EvolProver在多个基准测试中取得了新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 数据增强管道在多个基准测试中有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在多个领域表现出强大的表征学习能力，但DDIM的反演操作使得恶意用户更容易合成误导性或深度伪造内容，从而传播不道德、滥用以及侵犯隐私和版权的内容。

Method: 提出DDIM反演攻击（DIA），攻击集成的DDIM轨迹路径。

Result: DIA攻击能够有效扰乱扩散过程，优于以往的防御方法，并在各种编辑方法中都表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架和结果可以为工业界和研究界提供实用的防御方法，以对抗恶意使用AI的行为。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

essential cognitive and problem solving skills. The study highlights the
importance of responsible AI usage, ethical considerations, and the need for

Conclusion: ChemX基准对于推动化学领域的自动化信息提取至关重要，可以挑战现有方法的泛化能力，并为有效的评估策略提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

Result: 证明了在特定条件下，加权知识库和可废止条件集可以产生相同的解释排序，并且某些概念在这两种形式体系中可以等价表达。

Conclusion: 研究结果可能有助于进一步研究基于代价的语义和c-表示。

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的方法，通过形式化逻辑来计算与观察到的一致和不一致决策在逻辑上一致的群体评估集合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当两位专家在测试中意见不一致时，我们可以断定他们不可能都是 100% 正确的。但如果他们完全一致，则无法排除任何可能的评估。本文旨在研究协议与分歧在效用上的这种不对称性。

Method: 该方法将对齐决策的统计摘要输入到一个线性规划问题中，该问题存在于给定真实标签的可能正确或不正确响应的整数空间中。明显的逻辑约束，例如，正确响应的数量不能超过观察到的响应的数量，是不等式。此外，还有适用于所有有限测试的普遍适用的线性等式公理。

Result: 通过构建无需知识的警报来证明了这种仅使用逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法的实际和直接效用，该警报可以检测到一个或多个 LLM-as-Judges 何时违反用户指定的最低评分阈值。

Conclusion: 本文通过形式化逻辑推理，提出了一种仅依赖一致性判断进行无监督模型评估的有效方法，并验证了其在检测LLM评分异常方面的实用性。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Result: 实验结果表明，应用SMOTE显著增强了所有模型检测拉高出货事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM实现了较高的召回率（分别为94.87%和93.59%），并具有较强的F1分数和快速的计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合，显著提高了对操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立一个更公平、更透明和更稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Conclusion: 分析验证了学习的参数编码了关于模型能力和查询特征的有意义的、可解释的信息。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Conclusion: AIDE基于MCTS的框架提供了显著的可扩展性，可以集成额外的模式提取策略和领域知识，使其成为开发自动化知识发现综合解决方案的重要一步。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: 提出FusionAdapter以提升MMKG在少样本关系学习（FSRL）中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MMKG方法主要将模态对齐到共享空间，忽略了特定模态的独特贡献，限制了其在低资源环境下的性能。

Method: FusionAdapter引入了(1)一个adapter模块，使每个模态能够有效地适应未见过的关系；(2)一种融合策略，整合多模态实体表示，同时保留不同的模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的大量实验表明，FusionAdapter优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效地适应和融合来自不同模态的信息，FusionAdapter提高了对新关系的泛化能力，且只需最少的监督。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的CVRP切割平面方法，通过在推理时进行随机搜索来增强训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的分离方法生成的切割不足，因为它对生成不同的子集不够敏感。

Method: 1. 将随机边缘选择引入图粗化过程，代替了之前提出的贪婪方法。2. 提出了基于图粗化历史的分区（GraphCHiP）算法，该算法利用粗化历史来识别RCIs和FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上的实验表明，与现有的神经分离方法相比，该方法在减少对偶间隙方面是有效的。此外，我们的方法在一个特定的实例上发现了有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地减少对偶间隙，并发现有效的FCIs。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

TL;DR: AutoPK是一个用于从复杂表格中提取PK数据的两阶段框架，通过LLM和混合相似性度量等技术，显著提高了PK数据提取的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PK数据通常嵌入在复杂、异构的表格中，结构多变且术语不一致，给自动PK数据检索和标准化带来了巨大的挑战。

Method: AutoPK采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用LLM识别和提取PK参数变体；第二阶段过滤相关行，将表格转换为键值文本格式，并使用LLM重建标准化表格。

Result: AutoPK在包含605个PK表格的真实数据集上进行了评估，结果表明，与直接使用LLM相比，AutoPK在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提高。例如，使用LLaMA 3.1-70B的AutoPK在半衰期和清除参数上的F1分数分别达到了0.92和0.91。

Conclusion: AutoPK实现了可扩展且高可信度的PK数据提取，适用于兽医药理学、药物安全监测和公共卫生决策等关键应用，同时解决了异构表格结构和术语问题，并展示了关键PK参数的通用性。

Abstract: Pharmacokinetics (PK) plays a critical role in drug development and
regulatory decision-making for human and veterinary medicine, directly
affecting public health through drug safety and efficacy assessments. However,
PK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable
structures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for
automated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage
framework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex
scientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK
parameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity
metric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,
converts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct
a standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,
including captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in
precision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA
3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance
parameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and
0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with
AutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's
hallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled
open-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as
GPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and
high-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical
applications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public
health decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and
terminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters. Code

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于评估数据货币化背景下数据质量的综合分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在平衡计分卡（BSC）框架内，将一百多个指标和关键绩效指标（KPI）组织成四个子集群（基本、上下文、分辨率和专业化），整合通用和特定领域的数据质量维度。

Method: 通过系统的文献综述开发。

Result: 该分类法将数据质量定位为BSC的财务、客户、内部流程以及学习与增长视角之间的战略连接器，展示了质量指标如何支撑估值准确性、客户信任、运营效率和创新能力。框架的互连“指标层”确保一个维度的改进会影响其他维度，从而最大化战略影响。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了细粒度技术评估和高层决策之间的差距，为从业者、数据管理员和战略家提供了一个可扩展的、基于证据的参考，用于将数据质量管理与可持续价值创造对齐。

Abstract: This chapter presents a comprehensive taxonomy for assessing data quality in
the context of data monetisation, developed through a systematic literature
review. Organising over one hundred metrics and Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) into four subclusters (Fundamental, Contextual, Resolution, and
Specialised) within the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework, the taxonomy
integrates both universal and domain-specific quality dimensions. By
positioning data quality as a strategic connector across the BSC's Financial,
Customer, Internal Processes, and Learning & Growth perspectives, it
demonstrates how quality metrics underpin valuation accuracy, customer trust,
operational efficiency, and innovation capacity. The framework's interconnected
"metrics layer" ensures that improvements in one dimension cascade into others,
maximising strategic impact. This holistic approach bridges the gap between
granular technical assessment and high-level decision-making, offering
practitioners, data stewards, and strategists a scalable, evidence-based
reference for aligning data quality management with sustainable value creation.

TL;DR: EMR-AGENT是一个基于代理的框架，旨在通过动态的、语言模型驱动的交互来提取和标准化结构化临床数据，从而取代手动规则编写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的临床预测机器学习模型依赖于从电子病历（EMR）中提取的结构化数据，但这一过程主要依赖于硬编码的、特定于数据库的流程，这限制了可扩展性、可重复性和跨机构的泛化。

Method: 该框架通过交互式查询数据库来自动进行队列选择、特征提取和代码映射。模块化代理迭代地观察查询结果，并根据模式和文档进行推理，使用SQL不仅用于数据检索，还用作数据库观察和决策的工具。这消除了对手工编写的、特定于模式的逻辑的需求。

Result: 在三个EMR数据库（MIMIC-III、eICU、SICdb）上的基准测试表明，该框架在这些数据库上表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了自动化先前认为需要专家驱动设计的流程的可行性。代码已公开发布。

Abstract: Machine learning models for clinical prediction rely on structured data
extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), yet this process remains
dominated by hardcoded, database-specific pipelines for cohort definition,
feature selection, and code mapping. These manual efforts limit scalability,
reproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we
introduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an
agent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language
model-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.
Our framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping
through interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively
observe query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not
just for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and
decision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific
logic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for
three EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen
schema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization
across these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process
previously thought to require expert-driven design. The code will be released
publicly at https://github.com/AITRICS/EMR-AGENT/tree/main. For a

TL;DR: 对比损失与AUC无关，导致检索增强生成(RAG)等下游任务的性能欠佳。提出了一种新的训练目标MW损失，该目标最大化Mann-Whitney U统计量，在AUC和标准检索指标方面始终优于对比损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) 目标优化了一种软化的排序代理，但该代理与分数分离质量无关，导致下游任务性能欠佳。

Method: 提出了一种新的训练目标MW损失，该目标最大化Mann-Whitney U统计量，相当于ROC曲线下的面积(AUC)。MW损失通过最小化分数差异上的二元交叉熵来鼓励每个正负样本对的正确排序。

Result: 使用MW损失训练的检索器在AUC和标准检索指标方面始终优于对比检索器。

Conclusion: MW损失是对比损失的一种经验上更优越的替代方案，为RAG等高风险应用产生更好校准和更具区分性的检索器。

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了参加TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track，提高跨语言信息检索（CLIR）和多语言信息检索（MLIR）的效果。

Method: 采用了PLAID模型，包括TD、GD和MTD等训练技术，以及GPT-4和Claude-3.5等大型语言模型进行重排序、总结和事实提取。使用了系统组合的方法，将不同模型的输出进行融合和验证。

Result: 团队提交了运行结果到所有NeuCLIR任务：CLIR和MLIR新闻任务，以及技术文档任务和报告生成任务。

Conclusion: 该研究探索了多种模型和技术在跨语言信息检索和报告生成任务中的应用，并提交了TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track 的结果。

Abstract: The HLTCOE team applied PLAID, an mT5 reranker, GPT-4 reranker, score fusion,
and document translation to the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track. For PLAID we included
a variety of models and training techniques -- Translate Distill (TD), Generate
Distill (GD) and multi-lingual translate-distill (MTD). TD uses scores from the
mT5 model over English MS MARCO query-document pairs to learn how to score
query-document pairs where the documents are translated to match the CLIR
setting. GD follows TD but uses passages from the collection and queries
generated by an LLM for training examples. MTD uses MS MARCO translated into
multiple languages, allowing experiments on how to batch the data during
training. Finally, for report generation we experimented with system
combination over different runs. One family of systems used either GPT-4o or
Claude-3.5-Sonnet to summarize the retrieved results from a series of
decomposed sub-questions. Another system took the output from those two models
and verified/combined them with Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The other family used GPT4o
and GPT3.5Turbo to extract and group relevant facts from the retrieved
documents based on the decomposed queries. The resulting submissions directly
concatenate the grouped facts to form the report and their documents of origin
as the citations. The team submitted runs to all NeuCLIR tasks: CLIR and MLIR
news tasks as well as the technical documents task and the report generation
task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种具有强历史独立性、鲁棒性并支持动态更新的学习增强数据结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习增强数据结构利用预测的频率估计来更快地检索频繁出现的数据库元素，但其隐私和安全性影响在很大程度上尚未被探索。

Method: 本文介绍了两种技术：阈值化，它可以自动使任何学习增强数据结构都具有鲁棒性；配对，一种在动态环境中提供强历史独立性的简单技术。

Result: 实验结果表明，安全性和效率之间存在权衡，但仍与现有技术竞争。

Conclusion: 本文朝着该设置中的隐私和安全保证迈出了第一步，提出了第一个学习增强的数据结构，该结构具有强大的历史独立性，鲁棒性，并支持动态更新。

Abstract: Learning-augmented data structures use predicted frequency estimates to
retrieve frequently occurring database elements faster than standard data
structures. Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit
these frequency estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial
prediction errors. However, the privacy and security implications of this
setting remain largely unexplored.
  In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal
information beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for
learning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data
structure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no
information about past operations except what is inferred from its current
contents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security
guarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data
structure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic
updates.
  To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which
automatically makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing,
a simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic
setting. Our experimental results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and
efficiency but are still competitive with the state of the art.

TL;DR: MILCO: A multilingual extension of Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) that maps queries and documents into a shared English lexical space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LSR approaches struggle to scale beyond English, and uncommon entities are often lost when projected into English.

Method: A two-stage training regime combining Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training, and a new LexEcho head augmenting the English lexical representation with a source-language view.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming leading baselines. MILCO 560M outperforms Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with significantly reduced dimensions after pruning.

Conclusion: MILCO effectively extends LSR to multiple languages with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with
the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale
beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and
documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a
multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime
that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide
representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic
collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost
when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances
robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a
source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves
state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming
leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and
Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic
efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to
reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO
560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索与原始查询语言不同的相关文档的挑战。传统方法将该任务视为通过翻译增强的单语检索，孤立地处理检索方法和跨语言能力。最近的进展转向了基于嵌入的方法，并利用了多语言大型语言模型 (LLM)，但跨语言对齐表示仍然是一个核心挑战。

Result: 跨语言嵌入和多语言 LLM 的出现提供了一种新的范例，提高了检索性能并实现了答案生成。

Conclusion: 确定了数据不平衡和语言变异等长期存在的挑战，并为推进公平有效的跨语言信息检索提出了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

Result: 模型表明，使用堆叠自编码器进行表征学习适合聚类任务，并能显著改善聚类搜索结果。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了搜索结果的准确性和相关性。

Abstract: Due to an information explosion on the internet, there is a need for the
development of aggregated search systems that can boost the retrieval and
management of content in various formats. To further improve the clustering of
Arabic text data in aggregated search environments, this research investigates
the application of advanced natural language processing techniques, namely
stacked autoencoders and AraBERT embeddings. By transcending the limitations of
traditional search engines, which are imprecise, not contextually relevant, and
not personalized, we offer more enriched, context-aware characterizations of
search results, so we used a K-means clustering algorithm to discover
distinctive features and relationships in these results, we then used our
approach on different Arabic queries to evaluate its effectiveness. Our model
illustrates that using stacked autoencoders in representation learning suits
clustering tasks and can significantly improve clustering search results. It
also demonstrates improved accuracy and relevance of search results.

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果为改进视觉文档检索模型提供了指导，并提供了一个高性能的紧凑模型 ModernVBERT。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models are gaining prevalence, notably for document
retrieval as efficient alternatives to text-only pipelines. These models are
typically built by finetuning large vision-language decoders (VLMs) with
contrastive losses on text-image pairs. In this work, we show that, while
cost-efficient, this repurposing approach often bottlenecks retrieval
performance. Through controlled experiments, we establish a principled recipe
for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact
of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and
late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central
performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a
compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms models up to 10
times larger when finetuned on document retrieval tasks. Models and code are

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG开发者提供了构建更强大的测试套件的工具，从而提高系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别不一致的文档等应用。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate

### [153] [Graph2Region: Efficient Graph Similarity Learning with Structure and Scale Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00394)
*Zhouyang Liu,Yixin Chen,Ning Liu,Jiezhong He,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 Graph2Region (G2R) 的新的基于几何的图嵌入方法，用于解决图相似性计算问题，该方法通过将节点表示为闭合区域并在嵌入空间中恢复它们的邻接模式来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么涉及昂贵的成对节点比较，要么未能有效利用图的结构和尺度信息。

Method: G2R 将节点表示为闭合区域，并在嵌入空间中恢复它们的邻接模式。通过结合图的节点特征和邻接模式，G2R 概括了图区域（即图嵌入），其中形状捕获了底层图结构，体积反映了图大小。图区域之间的重叠可以作为 MCS 的近似值，表示相似的节点区域和邻接模式。使用不相交部分作为 GED 相似性的代理，从而能够同时计算 MCS 和 GED。

Result: G2R 在 MCS 相似性学习方面实现了高达 60.0% 的相对准确度提升，同时保持了训练和推理效率。G2R 在同时预测 MCS 和 GED 相似性方面表现出卓越的能力。

Conclusion: G2R 是一种用于图相似性计算的有效方法，它优于现有技术，并且能够同时预测 MCS 和 GED 相似性。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

TL;DR: TransIP: 利用 Transformer 学习原子间势，无需硬性架构约束，实现与现有技术相当的性能，并在不同数据集大小上优于数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最优模型通过等变神经网络架构强制执行旋转平移对称性，这可能导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: TransIP 通过优化嵌入空间中的表示，引导通用非等变 Transformer 模型学习 SO(3)-等变性。

Result: 在 Open Molecules (OMol25) 数据集上训练，TransIP 在机器学习力场中获得了与最先进的等变基线相当的性能，并且在不同数据集大小上比数据增强基线提高了 40% 到 60% 的性能。

Conclusion: 学习到的等变性可以替代等变或基于增强的 MLIP 模型，并且更强大和高效。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

TL;DR: PANORAMA is a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds, achieving significant speedups without recall loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time computing distances in the final refinement phase.

Method: Data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms compact signal energy, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. Integrated into IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.

Result: 2-30x end-to-end speedup with no recall loss across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: PANORAMA significantly improves ANNS performance by addressing the verification bottleneck.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

*Ye Qiao,Haocheng Xu,Xiaofan Zhang,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoPE position interpolation (PI) with post-training quantization (PTQ) degrades accuracy due to coupled effects. Q-ROAR, a weight-only, interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs, reduces the model's perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. Combining RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy.

Method: Introduce Q-ROAR (Quantization, RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only, interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights.

Result: Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks.

Conclusion: Q-ROAR is an effective method to stabilize PI for quantized LLMs.

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

TL;DR: DexBench是一个评估大型语言模型在糖尿病管理决策任务中表现的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估大型语言模型在糖尿病患者日常决策任务中的表现，填补了现有健康基准的空白。

Method: 构建了一个包含7个任务类别、来自15000人的连续血糖监测数据和行为日志的数据集，生成了360600个个性化的问题。

Result: 评估了8个大型语言模型在准确性、扎实性、安全性、清晰性和可操作性五个指标上的表现，发现模型之间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 旨在提高人工智能解决方案在糖尿病护理中的可靠性、安全性、有效性和实用性。

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界的机器学习问题涉及固有的层级数据，但传统方法依赖于欧几里德度量，无法捕捉层级关系的离散分支性质。

Method: 本文在p-adic度量空间中建立了机器学习的理论基础。

Result: 主要结果证明，最小化数据集中点到n维平面的p-adic距离之和的平面必须至少穿过这些点中的n+1个。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，p-adic度量对于正确处理机器学习中的层级数据结构可能至关重要。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align: 利用大型语言模型进行联邦学习，以应对异构表格数据中的模式差异，提高 F1-score 并降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中，由于客户端表格数据异构性导致的模式和特征空间不兼容问题。

Method: 提出 FedLLM-Align 框架，该框架利用预训练的大型语言模型作为通用特征提取器，将表格记录序列化为文本，并使用 DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa 和 ClinicalBERT 等模型提供语义对齐的表示，以支持标准 FedAvg 协议下的轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在模拟模式差异的 Framingham 数据集上，FedLLM-Align 在冠心病预测方面优于现有方法，F1-score 提高了 0.25，通信成本降低了 65%。在极端模式差异下，该方法表现出优雅的降级。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align 是一种稳健、保护隐私且通信高效的联邦学习解决方案，适用于异构环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Result: 验证了所提出的模型可以有效地用于顺序数据的统计建模和OR任务。

Conclusion: 所提出的近似单峰似然模型可以减轻单峰似然模型对非单峰CPD的偏差，并且可以有效地用于顺序数据的统计建模和OR任务。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的NeurTransformer方法在精度和能效方面都具有优势。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

Conclusion: 奖励选择是扩展反馈受限环境中强化学习的强大范例。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在多位数乘法上的失败原因。

Method: 通过逆向工程一个通过隐式思维链成功学习乘法的模型。

Result: 发现模型能够编码多位数乘法所需的必要长程依赖，并使用注意力机制构建有向无环图来缓存和检索部分积，以及使用 Minkowski 和与傅里叶基表示数字。

Conclusion: 通过逆向工程隐式思维链模型，揭示了 Transformer 学习长程依赖的一个陷阱，并提供了一个如何通过正确的归纳偏置解决此问题的例子。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

<details>

Motivation: The representational capacity of LoRA often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces.

Method: Proposes PrunedLoRA, a framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. It dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation, enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. Also, by minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, it provides fine-grained pruning and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded interpretation. Provides the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of structured pruning and provably shows that under the impact of weight perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based pruning with respect to overall loss.

Result: PrunedLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding, and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods across diverse sparsity levels.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA enables flexible and adaptive rank allocation.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 GRPO-$\\lambda$ 的 GRPO 扩展，旨在增强 LLM 在复杂推理任务中 RL 微调的信用分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 GRPO 方法在token序列上分配细粒度信用方面存在局限性。

Method: 该方法通过使用token级log-概率的资格迹和TD误差的无批评近似来近似从$\lambda$-return中学习。

Result: 在 LLaMA-3.1 和 Qwen-2.5 架构上，RL 训练期间性能提高了 30-40%。在 AIME24、Math500、OlympiadMath、MinervaMath 和 AMC 上的平均性能比 GRPO 提高了 3 个点以上，7B 模型提高了 4.5 个点。

Conclusion: GRPO-$\\lambda$ 显著优于 GRPO。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Conclusion: 即将向公众开放RouterArena平台。

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

TL;DR: LoRAFusion是一个高效的LoRA微调系统，通过融合内存受限操作和自适应批处理算法，提高了LLM的微调速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA微调系统存在冗余内存访问和无法并发微调多个LoRA适配器的问题，导致运行时开销大和性能提升受限。

Method: LoRAFusion在内核层面采用图分割方法融合内存受限操作，在调度层面引入自适应批处理算法。

Result: LoRAFusion相比Megatron-LM实现了高达1.96倍的端到端加速，相比mLoRA实现了高达1.46倍的性能提升。融合内核实现了高达1.39倍的内核性能提升。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过优化的内核和调度策略，显著提高了LoRA微调的效率，并且可以作为现有LoRA系统的即插即用替代品。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

TL;DR: 提出了Directed-MAML，一种新的任务导向的元强化学习算法，旨在克服MAML在元强化学习中的计算和内存开销以及收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML应用于元强化学习(meta-RL)存在显著挑战，包括依赖二阶梯度计算导致计算和内存开销大，以及嵌套优化结构增加问题复杂性，使得难以收敛到全局最优。

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤之前，Directed-MAML应用额外的 first-order task-directed approximation 来估计二阶梯度的影响，从而加速收敛到最优并降低计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，在 CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2 和 two-vehicle intersection crossing 等场景中，Directed-MAML 在计算效率和收敛速度上超过了基于 MAML 的基线。任务导向近似可以有效地集成到其他元学习算法中，例如 FOMAML 和 Meta-SGD，从而提高计算效率和收敛速度。

Conclusion: Directed-MAML 优于 MAML，且其任务导向近似方法可推广到其他元学习算法，以提升计算效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Thoughtbubbles 的 Transformer 变体，它可以通过学习分支或删除残差流，在潜在空间中执行并行自适应计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Transformer 推理计算扩展方法依赖于在生成答案之前训练模型以产生显式的思维链 tokens，但这些方法无法应用于预训练，并且仅限于串行生成的自然语言 verbalization 来扩展推理时计算。

Method: Thoughtbubbles 通过学习在网络中间 fork 或删除残差流，从而在潜在空间中执行并行自适应计算，允许需要大量计算的 tokens 形成“bubble”。

Result: 在 OpenWebText 和 peS2o 困惑度以及零样本评估（如 HellaSwag 和 LAMBADA）中，Thoughtbubbles 的性能优于标准解码器 LM 以及非自适应并行计算方法。

Conclusion: Thoughtbubbles 的隐式特性使得自适应计算能够在预训练时学习，为统一推理模型的训练和测试时间行为铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: KV缓存压缩可以提高吞吐量和效率，但实际应用中可能会导致指令退化，甚至被LLM忽略。论文指出了部署KV缓存压缩LLM时应注意的几个问题，并以系统提示泄露为例进行了案例研究，提出了改进KV缓存驱逐策略的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在多指令提示等实际场景中的影响，填补现有研究的不足。

Method: 通过实验，作者研究了压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差等因素对提示泄露的影响，并提出了改进KV缓存驱逐策略的方法。

Result: 研究表明，某些指令在压缩后会迅速退化，导致LLM忽略这些指令。系统提示泄露是一个实际案例，压缩会影响泄露和通用指令的执行。改进的KV缓存驱逐策略可以减少这些因素的影响，提高多指令任务的整体性能。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩在提高吞吐量的同时，可能会对LLM的指令执行产生负面影响，尤其是在多指令任务中。通过改进KV缓存驱逐策略，可以减轻这些负面影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Motivation: achieving interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge

Method: DIANO compresses high-dimensional input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. a fully differentiable partial differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics.

Result: DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders is assessed. DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent interpretability is demonstrated.

Conclusion: These case studies demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent interpretability.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是传统深度学习算法通常将 mini-batch 样本视为单个对象，仅计算平均梯度，而忽略了其他统计信息。本文旨在证明计算这些额外统计信息是可行的。

Method: 通过修改 AD 图来实现梯度统计，并利用 JAX 的向量化转换在 transformer 等模型中进行原型设计和实验。

Result: 研究表明，signSGD 中 sign 操作的最佳位置对成功至关重要，且 Adam preconditioner 中均值比方差更重要。

Conclusion: 总之，per-example 梯度信息为算法设计提供了新的分析和可能性。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

TL;DR: 本文对监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的泛化能力进行了对比研究，发现SFT的不足主要源于冻结提示，通过引入提示多样性和思维链（CoT）监督，SFT可以实现与RL相当甚至更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通常认为SFT泛化能力差，RL更robust。本文旨在重新评估这一观点。

Method: 在Sokoban和General Points两个决策基准上，通过系统评估，研究prompt多样性和CoT对SFT泛化能力的影响。

Result: 引入prompt多样性可以打破SFT对训练语义的依赖，提高泛化能力。CoT监督可以显著提升SFT在更难任务上的迁移能力。结合prompt多样性和CoT可以实现最佳泛化效果，与RL基线持平或更好。

Conclusion: 通过适当的数据集，SFT可以实现与RL一样强大的泛化能力，挑战了SFT不如RL的传统观点。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

Result: 我们的分析表明，用高斯混合模型（GMM）和贝叶斯高斯混合模型（BGMM）近似潜在空间为构建能够估计模型效率并指导寻找最佳简约表示的奖励函数提供了坚实的基础。

Conclusion: 总而言之，使用高斯混合模型（GMM）和贝叶斯高斯混合模型（BGMM）近似潜在空间可以指导寻找最佳简约表示

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过处理数据的线性组合来减轻分布式计算中的落后者和对抗性故障，受编码计算的启发，

Method: 将编码计算应用于机器学习，设计了一种有效的正则化机制，鼓励更平滑的表示和更具泛化性的解决方案。

Result: 在监督和非监督任务上的大量实验表明，编码平滑能够持续提高泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击中实现最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块可以无缝集成到标准训练和推理管道中，以提高模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

*Buu Phan,Reza Ebrahimi,Sanjay Haresh,Roland Memisevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 混合模型在序列长度泛化方面表现不佳，因为Transformer组件倾向于利用捷径解决方案。通过延迟训练注意力层，可以减轻这种影响，并显著提高长度泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究序列模型在复合问题中的长度泛化能力，该问题涉及状态跟踪和关联回忆。循环网络擅长状态跟踪，但难以进行回忆，而Transformer擅长回忆，但无法将状态跟踪能力扩展到更长的序列。

Method: 构建集成循环和基于注意力的组件的混合模型，并在组合任务上训练它们，以评估是否可以保留这两种能力。提出了一种简单的训练策略，即延迟训练注意力层。

Result: Transformer组件倾向于利用捷径解决方案，导致长度泛化能力差。延迟训练注意力层可以减轻这种影响，并显著提高长度泛化性能。混合模型在比训练中使用的序列长三倍的混合序列上实现了接近完美的精度（> 90％）。

Conclusion: 混合模型可以通过延迟训练注意力层来提高长度泛化性能。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE生成的样本模糊且不一致，部分原因是“先验孔”问题，即先验概率高但后验概率低的区域。理想情况下，先验需要足够灵活以匹配后验，同时保留快速生成样本的能力。

Method: 将先验建模为基于能量的模型（EBM），并采用变分方法来处理EBM中的归一化常数，使用采样器网络来近似变分形式，从而绕过昂贵的MCMC方法。这种训练先验的方法可以表示为交替优化问题。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) 方法在图像生成质量、减少先验孔和提高采样效率方面有所改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的VAE先验建模方法，可以提高图像生成质量，减少先验孔，并提高采样效率。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: SLogic: Uses query-specific context to assign scores to logical rules for knowledge graph completion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat logical rules as universal, ignoring query-specific context, which limits their performance.

Method: SLogic: A framework that assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules using a scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity.

Result: SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SLogic leverages local subgraph context to improve knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的快速采样算法，用于实现无损并行解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双向注意力机制使扩散大型语言模型(DLLM)在捕获上下文连接方面更强大，但在推理效率方面不如自回归模型。现有的并行解码算法会降低性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave) 的新算法，用于并行解码候选生成和验证。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，DLLM的吞吐量可以提高到2.8倍，且不降低性能。

Conclusion: Freedave 是一种为 DLLM 定制的快速采样算法，可实现无损并行解码。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Method: 利用动态系统理论，通过识别参数空间中的稳定流形来定义可塑性损失，这些流形会捕获梯度轨迹。

Result: 揭示了两种主要的陷阱形成机制：激活饱和导致的冻结单元和表示冗余导致的克隆单元流形。推广静态设置中的属性（如低秩表示和简单性偏差）会导致持续学习场景中的可塑性损失。

Conclusion: 通过数值模拟验证了理论分析，并探讨了架构选择或有针对性的扰动作为潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Motivation: 联邦推理作为一种有吸引力的解决方案，可以结合来自多个模型的预测，同时保持每个模型的本地性和专有性。然而，联邦推理的鲁棒性在很大程度上被忽视，使其容易受到简单的攻击。

Method: 分析了基于平均的聚合器的误差，并表明当诚实响应之间的差异较小或两个最可能的类之间的差异较大时，聚合器的误差较小。将具有非线性聚合器的鲁棒联邦推理问题转化为对抗性机器学习问题，并引入了一种使用 DeepSet 聚合模型的高级技术，提出了一种对抗性训练和测试时鲁棒聚合的新型组合，以增强非线性聚合器的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文解决了联邦推理中鲁棒性不足的问题，通过形式化鲁棒联邦推理问题并提出一种新的对抗性训练和测试时鲁棒聚合组合方法，显著提高了非线性聚合器的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种token和参数高效的变体Discretized Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC)，用于解决大型语言模型（LLM）在自动调制分类（AMC）中，长提示上下文和大型模型尺寸所带来的实际瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的AMC方法中，长提示上下文和大型模型尺寸阻碍了环内部署的问题。

Method: 通过以下方式实现：(i) 将高阶统计量和累积量离散化为紧凑的符号token；(ii) 通过轻量级的k-top神经预过滤器修剪示例列表，并使用从先前LLM响应中提取的理由来过滤误导性/低影响的特征；(iii) 通过校准的提示模板强制执行仅标签预测。

Result: 在具有噪声的十种调制类型的合成AMC上，一个7B参数的DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen基线实现了5.2%的准确率，而我们的系统，使用大约5B参数的Gemini-2.5-Flash模型，达到了45.5%的准确率。推理成本降低了2倍以上，同时保留了基于prompt的AMC的优势。

Conclusion: 结果表明，仔细的离散化和上下文选择可以在将推理成本降低2倍以上的同时，保留基于prompt的AMC的优势，并实现实际的环内使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为DecepChain的新的后门攻击范式，该范式可以诱导大型语言模型（LLM）生成看似合理但实际上不正确的CoT，从而在不留下明显操纵痕迹的情况下误导人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力越来越强，但它们对思维链（CoT）的依赖性构成了一种脆弱的信任基础。攻击者可以利用这一点诱导LLM生成不正确的CoT。

Method: 该论文提出DecepChain，通过对模型自身生成的自然错误rollout进行微调，然后通过GRPO进行强化，并结合合理性正则化器来保持流畅且看似良性的推理。

Result: DecepChain在多个基准和模型上实现了高攻击成功率，同时对良性场景的性能影响很小。人工评估表明，人类很难区分被操纵的推理过程和良性推理过程。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能会悄悄地破坏LLM的答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，因此需要对这种令人担忧的风险进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike

bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然skip connection可以稳定优化，但它们也会破坏表征的层次结构，因此作者研究了是否可以在没有skip connection的情况下有效地训练transformer。

Method: 作者通过分析skipless transformer block的雅可比矩阵，揭示了skip connection改善条件的原因，并通过一个有原则的初始化策略来恢复它们的稳定优势。基于这个洞察，作者提出了一种新的方法，可以在不改变标准架构的情况下，稳定有效地训练skipless transformer。

Result: 作者在有监督和自监督设置下的视觉Transformer (ViT)上验证了他们的方法，结果表明，用他们的初始化方法训练的skipless ViT克服了通常的优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次结构表示，并且在密集预测基准测试中优于包含skip connection的强大baseline。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，skip connection不是训练ViT的基本要求，并为视觉模型中的分层表征学习开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

### [193] [Initial Distribution Sensitivity of Constrained Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00348)
*Alperen Tercan,Necmiye Ozay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMDPs are harder to solve than MDPs because optimal policies change with initial state distributions. The paper analyzes how the optimal value of CMDPs changes with different initial distributions, deriving bounds on these variations. It also shows how these bounds can be used to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown changes in the initial distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs need to be re-solved when the initial distribution changes, unlike standard MDPs.

Method: Duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation analysis in linear programming.

Result: Bounds on the variations of the optimal value of CMDPs with different initial distributions.

Conclusion: The bounds can be used to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the initial distribution.

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

*Rohit Dilip,Evan Zhang,Ayush Varshney,David Van Valen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kanzi is a flow-based tokenizer for protein structures that simplifies the training process and outperforms existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure tokenizers rely on bespoke components that are challenging to optimize and scale.

Method: A diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss.

Result: Kanzi stabilizes training, outperforms existing tokenizers on reconstruction, and achieves ভালো generative performance.

Conclusion: Kanzi simplifies protein structure tokenization, enabling parameter-efficient models with ভালো performance.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

*Tong Chen,Yinuo Zhang,Pranam Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AReUReDi是一种用于多目标生物分子生成的离散优化算法，它能同时优化多个治疗特性，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在治疗和生物分子工程中，设计满足多个冲突目标序列是一个核心挑战。现有的生成框架主要在连续空间中运行，并以单目标为指导，而离散方法缺乏对多目标帕累托最优性的保证。

Method: AReUReDi结合了Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火 Metropolis-Hastings更新，以偏向于帕累托最优状态的采样，同时保持分布不变性。

Result: AReUReDi在肽和SMILES序列设计中，同时优化了多达五种治疗特性（包括亲和力、溶解度、溶血、半衰期和防污性），并且优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi是一个强大的、基于序列的框架，可用于多属性生物分子生成。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

*Gautham Bekal,Ashish Pujari,Scott David Kelly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个query-only的注意力机制，可以缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要在没有重复数据点的情况下从数据流中学习，由于任务之间的分布转移，这种情况非常复杂。

Method: 提出了一个query-only的注意力机制，它丢弃了键和值，但保留了transformer架构的核心归纳偏置。

Result: 在持续学习场景中，这种简化的机制显著减轻了可塑性的损失和灾难性遗忘，优于选择性重新初始化等基线方法。通过初步的Hessian谱分析，我们观察到在任务中保持较高曲率等级的模型倾向于保持可塑性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，完整的注意力机制可能不是在持续学习中获得元学习益处的必要条件。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GDLNN: combines a domain-specific language (GDL) with neural networks for graph classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces GDLNN to generate expressive and interpretable graph representations.

Method: The GDL layer generates graph representations. Model explanation techniques are applied to explain GDLNN's predictions.

Result: GDLNN achieves high accuracy on graph classification benchmarks, outperforming GNNs. Existing model explanation techniques yield high-quality explanations. GDLNN's cost is low when the explanation cost is included.

Conclusion: GDLNN is effective for graph classification, offering high accuracy, interpretability, and low cost.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.
