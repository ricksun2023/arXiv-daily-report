### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的数据增强方法，称为反偏数据增强（CounterBias Augmentation），旨在解决深度学习模型学习和利用训练数据中虚假相关性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型常常学习和利用训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在新数据上的泛化能力差。

Method: 该方法首先将文本分解为 subject-predicate-object 三元组，然后选择性地修改这些三元组以破坏虚假相关性，最后从调整后的三元组重建文本，生成反偏数据。

Result: 实验表明，CoBA 不仅提高了下游任务的性能，而且有效地减少了偏差，增强了 out-of-distribution 鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA 提供了一种通用且稳健的解决方案，可以应对虚假相关性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

### [2] [Mapping Toxic Comments Across Demographics: A Dataset from German Public Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21084)
*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发布了一个大型的德语数据集，其中包含来自 Instagram、TikTok 和 YouTube 上的带有毒性和年龄估计注释的评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有毒言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了我们对不同年龄段人群在线交流方式的理解。

Method: 该数据集包含 3,024 条人工注释和 30,024 条 LLM 注释的来自 Instagram、TikTok 和 YouTube 的匿名评论。为了确保相关性，评论通过预定义的有毒关键词进行整合，从而使 16.7% 的评论被标记为有问题评论。注释流程结合了人类专业知识和最先进的语言模型，识别了侮辱、虚假信息和对广播费用的批评等关键类别。

Result: 该数据集揭示了基于年龄的有毒言论模式的差异，年轻用户偏爱表达性语言，而年长用户更常参与虚假信息和贬低。

Conclusion: 该资源为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新的机会，并支持开发更公平和更具年龄意识的内容审核系统。

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Method: 在交叉注意模块中引入了缩放的位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码。

Result: 在IAM-OnDB数据集上，与以前的方法相比，基于Transformer的模型实现了35.56%的字符错误率(CER)降低和29.66%的字错误率(WER)降低。

Conclusion: TrInk模型在手写生成方面表现出色，并在IAM-OnDB数据集上取得了显著的错误率降低。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the
cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective
evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate
(CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset
compared to previous methods. We provide an demo page with handwriting samples
from TrInk and baseline models at: https://akahello-a11y.github.io/trink-demo/

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中的锚定效应，发现它们会受到该效应的影响，类似于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在实际应用中的可靠性问题，特别是它们可能存在的认知偏差。

Method: 通过指示卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，并使用客观和主观指标评估谈判结果。

Result: LLM受到锚定效应的影响；推理模型受该效应影响较小；人格特质与锚定效应的敏感性之间没有显著相关性。

Conclusion: 研究结果加深了对LLM中认知偏差的理解，有助于安全和负责任地应用LLM。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Percept-V的新数据集，用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在简单感知任务中的表现，并通过实验发现，尽管MLLM在复杂任务中表现出色，但在Percept-V数据集上，随着问题复杂性的增加，其性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前多模态大型语言模型在简单感知任务中的表现，因为现有研究对它们在处理包含基本形状和结构的生成图像时的性能评估有限。

Method: 构建了一个包含7200张程序生成图像的数据集Percept-V，这些图像分为30个类别，每个类别测试不同的视觉感知技能组合。然后，使用GPT-4o、Gemini和Claude等先进的MLLM以及OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1等大型推理模型在该数据集上进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，随着问题复杂性的增加，所有类别中模型的性能都显著下降。测试的MLLM在测试特定认知技能的类别中表现出相似的准确性趋势，并且发现某些技能比其他技能更难。

Conclusion: 尽管MLLM在许多复杂任务中表现出色，但在简单感知任务中，其性能会随着问题复杂性的增加而显著下降，这表明MLLM在感知能力方面仍有提升空间。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: 本研究综述了科学大型语言模型（Sci-LLM）的发展，并将其视为模型与其底层数据基质之间的协同演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨了科学数据对 Sci-LLM 发展的影响，以及科学语料库与通用自然语言处理数据集的不同之处。

Method: 构建了科学数据的统一分类法和科学知识的层次模型，并对 270 多个预/后训练数据集进行了分析。

Result: 强调了 Sci-LLM 对异构、多尺度、不确定性语料库的独特需求，以及对领域不变性和跨模态推理的需求。分析了超过 190 个基准数据集，揭示了从静态考试到面向过程和发现的评估的转变。

Conclusion: 提出了构建可信、不断发展的 AI 系统的路线图，该系统可以作为加速科学发现的真正伙伴。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的评估可能受到偏见影响。研究发现，模型身份的感知会严重扭曲高层次判断，并微妙地影响详细的质量评级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在自我评估和交叉评估中存在的偏见问题，因为LLM越来越多地被用于评估输出。

Method: 通过ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude在四种条件下（无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签）评估由每种模型撰写的博客文章。使用整体偏好投票和针对连贯性、信息性和简洁性的质量评级进行评估，所有分数均表示为百分比。

Result: “Claude”标签始终提高分数，而“Gemini”标签始终降低分数，与实际内容无关。错误标签经常颠倒排名，在偏好投票中产生高达50个百分点的变化，在转换后的质量评级中产生高达12个百分点的变化。在真实标签下，Gemini的自我评分崩溃，而Claude的自我偏好加剧。

Conclusion: 模型身份的感知会严重扭曲高层次判断，并微妙地影响详细的质量评级。需要盲或多模型评估协议，以确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用方法，通过序列贝叶斯实验设计（BED）框架，提高大型语言模型（LLM）智能地、自适应地从用户或其他外部来源收集信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使LLM能够作为有效的多轮对话代理，并与外部环境进行交互。

Method: 该方法名为BED-LLM（基于大型语言模型的贝叶斯实验设计），它基于迭代地选择问题或查询，以最大化关于感兴趣任务的预期信息增益（EIG）。

Result: BED-LLM在一系列基于20个问题的游戏和使用LLM主动推断用户偏好的测试中，与直接提示LLM和其他自适应设计策略相比，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了BED-LLM的有效性，并通过概率模型和特定创新，为构建有效的交互式LLM代理提供了见解。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于航空安全分析的自动HFACS分类框架，该框架利用强化学习微调Llama-3.1 8B语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析航空事故背后的人为因素对于预防未来事故至关重要，但使用人为因素分析和分类系统 (HFACS) 的传统方法在可扩展性和一致性方面受到限制。

Method: 利用强化学习和群体相对策略优化 (GRPO) 来微调 Llama-3.1 8B 语言模型。我们的方法结合了为航空安全分析量身定制的多组件奖励系统，并集成了合成数据生成，以克服事故数据集中的类别不平衡问题。

Result: GRPO 优化模型取得了显着的性能提升，包括精确匹配准确率提高了 350%（从 0.0400 提高到 0.1800），部分匹配准确率提高到 0.8800。我们的专业模型优于最先进的法学硕士（大型语言模型），包括 GPT-5-mini 和 Gemini-2.5-fiash 在关键指标上。

Conclusion: 这项研究验证了较小的、领域优化的模型可以为关键安全分析提供计算效率更高且更好的解决方案。这种方法使得在资源受限的边缘设备上进行强大的低延迟部署成为可能。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于像素的生成语言模型，以提高对拼写攻击的鲁棒性，并扩展对多种书写系统的多语言文本的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归语言模型容易受到拼写攻击的影响，这些攻击通过使用多语言字母表中的字符扰乱输入文本，导致性能显著下降。这种脆弱性主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入中固有的词汇外问题。

Method: 该方法用基于像素的表示替换基于文本的嵌入，通过将单词呈现为单独的图像。

Result: 在多语言 LAMBADA 数据集、WMT24 数据集和 SST-2 基准上评估了所提出的方法，证明了其对拼写噪声的弹性和在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成语言模型能够有效提高模型对拼写攻击的鲁棒性，并在多语言环境中表现良好。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个基于ElasticSearch的框架，用于索引和分析LLM的训练数据集，以便更快地查询和分析数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型语言模型严重依赖网络规模的数据集，但网络爬取的随意性导致数据质量、安全和伦理问题。现有研究由于计算限制，对有害内容的研究仅限于小样本。

Method: 使用ElasticSearch构建了一个索引和分析LLM训练数据集的pipeline。

Result: 在SwissAI的FineWeb-2语料库上实现了快速查询性能，大多数搜索在毫秒内完成，全部在2秒内完成。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了实时数据集分析，为更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

### [14] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督语音模型（S3M）中是否存在人类语言习得的关键期（CP）效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作已经使用文本语言模型研究了这些效应，但语音模型中的这些效应仍未得到充分探索，尽管口语在人类语言习得中起着核心作用。

Method: 我们使用儿童导向的语音训练S3M，改变L2训练开始时间和L1训练结束时间，并评估他们的语音识别性能。

Result: 我们发现，在语音习得方面，S3M没有表现出明显的CP效应证据。值得注意的是，延迟L2暴露的模型在L2上表现更好，而延迟L1暴露结束导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: S3M没有表现出明显的CP效应证据

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

*Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu,Feiyi Wang,Dan Lu,Junqi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的解码方法，旨在提高大型语言模型生成过程中的效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法在句子层面的生成中表现不佳，或者过度依赖于特定领域的知识。自洽性方法虽然有帮助，但计算成本很高。

Method: 该论文首先研究了自洽性方法中的冗余现象，然后提出了一个新颖的解码记忆管道（DMP），通过选择性推理和退火解码来加速生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下，实现了高达3倍的加速。

Conclusion: 该方法可以提高多响应生成的效率，并有望扩展到对齐和推理任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

the number in the original BLUEX. We evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs
and their ability to leverage visual context through captions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

### [18] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过常态概念重新审视图灵测试。其核心论点是，对常态的统计解释（理解为规范意义和数学意义上的平均值）有助于理解图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图灵测试的目标是正常/平均水平的人类智能，而不是特殊的人类智能。成功通过测试需要制造出像正常/平均人类一样会“犯错”和表现出不完美行为的机器。

Method: 通过分析图灵测试的统计特性，以及图灵在其原始论文中提到的“平均人类审问者”的概念。

Result: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）不太可能通过图灵测试，因为这些模型的目标是特殊而非正常/平均水平的人类智能。因此，它们构成了一种所谓的“人工聪明”模型，而不是真正的人工智能。

Conclusion: 图灵测试是否能对理解人类认知有所贡献的核心问题在于，人类思维是否真的可以简化为正常/平均水平的思维。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动文本摘要评估中可重复性不足的问题，现有评估指标结果不稳定。

Method: 通过一个统一的开源框架，在SummEval数据集上比较六种代表性指标（包括ROUGE和基于LLM的方法）。

Result: 结果表明，与人类判断最吻合的指标计算强度大且稳定性较差。基于LLM的评估指标存在随机性、技术依赖性和可重复性有限的问题。

Conclusion: 建议采用更可靠的评估协议，包括详尽的文档和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有自动评审生成器（ARGs）的能力和局限性，尤其是在检测研究逻辑错误方面，因为这对于维护科学完整性至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种全自动反事实评估框架，用于隔离和测试ARGs检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力。

Result: 研究发现，研究逻辑的缺陷对ARGs的输出评论没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，为未来的工作提出了三项可操作的建议，并公开发布了反事实数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试忽略了诊断准确性和临床相关性等重要评估维度，并且缺乏专门针对医学奖励模型的基准。

Method: 构建了一个包含13个器官系统和8个临床科室的多模态数据集，包含1026个专家注释的病例，并通过一个严谨的三步过程确保高质量的评估数据。

Result: 评估了32个最先进的MLLM，揭示了在使输出与专家判断相一致方面存在巨大挑战。通过微调，基线模型取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench是首个专门用于评估医学奖励模型和医学场景中判断的基准，结果表明需要进一步研究以提高MLLM在医学应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架来研究粗粒度语义维度之下的子维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索概念语义的核心维度对于揭示语言和大脑中意义的组织方式至关重要。现有方法通常依赖于预定义的语义维度，这些维度仅提供广泛的表示，忽略了更精细的概念区分。

Method: 引入了解耦连续语义表示模型 (DCSRM)，该模型将来自大型语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定的语义信息。使用这些子嵌入，识别一组可解释的语义子维度。为了评估它们的神经合理性，应用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活。

Result: 提供更细粒度的可解释的概念意义的语义子维度。语义维度根据不同的原则进行组织，极性是驱动它们分解为子维度的关键因素。

Conclusion: 语义子维度的神经关联支持它们的认知和神经科学合理性。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [23] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大型语言模型（LLM）中的“意识形态深度”，即其内在政治表征的稳健性和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些立场的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。简单的prompt工程可以操纵表面层次的反应，这让人怀疑它们是否反映了一种内在的意识形态。

Method: 该研究采用双重方法：首先，使用指令提示和激活steering测量两个开源LLM的“可操纵性”。其次，使用稀疏自动编码器（SAE）探测这些模型的内部机制。

Result: 研究发现，一些模型可以容易地在自由主义和保守主义观点之间切换，而另一些模型则表现出抵制或更高的拒绝率，这表明其意识形态结构更为根深蒂固。具有较低可操纵性的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征。一个模型可能比另一个类似大小的模型包含多7.3倍的政治特征。在意识形态“深刻”的模型中，对核心政治特征进行有针对性的消融，会导致其在相关主题上的推理发生一致的、逻辑的转变，而在“浅层”模型中进行相同的干预会导致拒绝输出的增加。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLM的一个可量化属性，并且可操纵性是了解其潜在政治架构的一个有价值的窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）计算需求高，不易广泛使用。提升小型语言模型（SLM）是一种有前景的替代方案，但现有方法（如 SFT 和 RLHF）存在不足，无法很好地激发创造性。

Method: 本文探索了两种 RLAIF 框架下的 AI 驱动奖励策略：1) 基于高质量偏好数据训练的奖励模型（RM）；2) 基于原则引导的 LLM-as-a-Judge，通过对抗训练和反思机制优化奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法都显著提升了创造性输出，但基于原则引导的 LLM-as-a-Judge 效果更好，且在训练效率和对人工标注数据的依赖性方面更具优势。

Conclusion: 基于原则引导的 LLM-as-a-Judge 是一种更具可扩展性和有效性的创意 SLM 发展路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自动分类器选择方法，该方法优先考虑多样性，并通过性能进行扩展，以提高集成模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理偏差使人们特别容易相信和传播社交媒体上的虚假新闻，从而在公共健康和政治等领域造成重大后果。基于机器学习的验证系统已被广泛研究以缓解这个问题。集成方法在组合多个分类器以提高鲁棒性方面特别有效。然而，它们的性能在很大程度上取决于组成分类器的多样性——选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，尤其是在模型倾向于学习冗余模式时。

Method: 该方法首先计算分类器之间的成对多样性，并应用层次聚类将它们组织成不同粒度级别的组。然后，HierarchySelect探索这些层次级别，以选择每个级别的一个分类器池，每个分类器池代表不同的池内多样性。从这些池中识别并选择最多样化的池以进行集成构建。选择过程包含一个评估指标，该指标反映每个分类器的性能，以确保集成也能很好地泛化。

Result: 我们使用来自不同应用领域的六个数据集和不同数量的类别的 40 个异构分类器进行了实验。我们的方法与 Elbow 启发式和最先进的基线进行了比较。结果表明，我们的方法在六个数据集中的两个上实现了最高的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的自动分类器选择方法，该方法优先考虑多样性，并通过性能进行扩展，实验结果表明该方法在一定程度上提高了集成模型的准确率。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据选择和合成方法在静态数据集管理方面存在局限性，无法适应不断发展的模型能力。

Method: 该框架包含一个自引用诊断模块，用于识别次优样本，然后使用自适应优化引擎将这些样本转换为有价值的训练点，同时保持语义完整性。该优化过程随模型能力持续演进。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一种通过数据和模型的动态人机协同进化实现可持续LLM训练的新范例。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple

### [29] [Personality Matters: User Traits Predict LLM Preferences in Multi-Turn Collaborative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21628)
*Sarfaroz Yunusov,Kaige Chen,Kazi Nishat Anwar,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了不同性格的用户是否系统性地偏爱某些大型语言模型（LLM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地融入日常工作流程，用户通过多轮协作来塑造结果，一个关键的问题出现了：具有不同性格特征的用户是否系统性地偏爱某些大型语言模型？

Method: 我们进行了一项研究，招募了32名参与者，他们平均分布在四种Keirsey性格类型中，评估他们与GPT-4和Claude 3.5在四个协作任务中的互动：数据分析、创意写作、信息检索和写作辅助。

Result: 结果显示，存在显著的性格驱动偏好：理性者强烈偏爱GPT-4，特别是在目标导向型任务中，而理想主义者则偏爱Claude 3.5，特别是在创意和分析任务中。其他性格类型表现出任务依赖性偏好。对定性反馈的情感分析证实了这些模式。值得注意的是，跨模型的总体帮助性评级相似，表明基于性格的分析如何揭示了传统评估遗漏的LLM差异。

Conclusion: 总之，不同性格的用户对大型语言模型存在系统性偏好，这表明在评估LLM时应考虑用户性格因素。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Motivation: To create a text embedding model with exceptional text representation capabilities.

Method: A unified multi-task framework with specialized data transformation and training strategies, including data synthesis using LLM API and a two-stage training strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards, and also performs well on reranking and clustering tasks.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为Misviz的基准数据集，用于检测具有误导性的可视化图表。同时，作者还发布了一个合成数据集Misviz-synth用于支持模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体和网络上存在大量具有误导性的可视化图表，它们歪曲数据并导致读者得出不准确的结论。先前的工作表明，人类和多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)经常被这些可视化图表所欺骗。自动检测具有误导性的可视化图表并识别它们违反的特定设计规则可以帮助保护读者并减少错误信息的传播。然而，由于缺乏大型、多样化和开放可用的数据集，人工智能模型的训练和评估受到了限制。

Method: 作者构建了包含2,604个真实可视化图表的Misviz基准数据集，并标注了12种类型的误导信息。为了支持模型训练，作者还发布了一个合成数据集Misviz-synth，该数据集包含81,814个使用Matplotlib生成的可视化图表，这些图表基于真实世界的数据表。

Result: 作者使用最先进的MLLM、基于规则的系统和微调分类器在两个数据集上进行了全面的评估。结果表明，这项任务仍然具有很高的挑战性。

Conclusion: 作者发布了Misviz、Misviz-synth和随附的代码。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为核心参数隔离微调 (CPI-FT) 的新框架，以解决 SFT 中的“跷跷板现象”，其中不加选择的参数更新会导致某些任务的进展以牺牲其他任务为代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有 SFT 方法中存在的“跷跷板现象”，即不加选择的参数更新会导致某些任务的进展以牺牲其他任务为代价。

Method: 1. 独立微调 LLM 以识别核心参数区域。2. 基于区域重叠对具有相似核心区域的任务进行分组，形成联合建模集群。3. 引入参数融合技术：将来自其单独微调模型的每个任务的核心参数直接移植到统一骨干中，而通过球面线性插值 (SLERP) 平滑集成来自不同任务的非核心参数，从而减轻破坏性干扰。4. 随后采用使用混合任务数据的轻量级、流水线式 SFT 训练阶段，同时冻结先前任务的核心区域以防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多个公共基准上的大量实验表明，该方法显着减轻了任务干扰和遗忘，始终优于 vanilla 多任务和多阶段微调基线。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的 CPI-FT 框架，该框架通过隔离核心参数和融合非核心参数来有效缓解 SFT 中的任务干扰和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是现有LLM在RiR任务中表现不佳，尤其是在数据和计算资源有限的情况下。

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合了批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习。

Result: MENTAT方法在RiR任务中比基线方法提高了高达65%的性能。

Conclusion: MENTAT方法在RiR任务中表现良好，但仍有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PiCSAR的无训练方法，通过计算推理和最终答案的联合对数似然来评估候选解决方案，从而提高大型语言模型和大型推理模型在推理任务中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推理任务中，设计一种无需访问真实答案即可识别正确推理链的评分函数是一个关键挑战。最佳n抽样通过生成多个候选解决方案并选择奖励最高的那个来提高大型语言模型（LLM）和大型推理模型（LRM）的准确性。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为概率置信度选择和排序（PiCSAR）的简单、无训练方法，该方法使用推理和最终答案的联合对数似然来对每个候选生成进行评分。推理和最终答案的联合对数似然自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度。

Result: PiCSAR在不同的基准测试中取得了显著的收益（MATH500上+10.18，AIME2025上+9.81），在20个比较中的16个中，优于至少减少2倍样本的基线。

Conclusion: 正确的推理链表现出明显更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究牙科疾病的自动分类方法。

Method: 使用包含 1512 张 X 光片的数据集，评估了三种方法：自定义卷积神经网络 (CNN)、CNN 特征提取与传统分类器相结合的混合模型以及微调的预训练架构。实验采用 5 折交叉验证，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和 F1 分数作为评估指标。

Result: 混合 CNN 随机森林模型实现了最高的性能，准确率为 85.4%，超过了自定义 CNN 基线的 74.3%。在预训练模型中，VGG16 的性能最佳，准确率为 82.3%，其次是 Xception 和 ResNet50。

Conclusion: 混合模型提高了形态相似病症的区分度，并提供了高效、可靠的性能。将基于 CNN 的特征提取与集成分类器相结合，为自动化牙科诊断支持提供了一条实用途径，同时也强调需要更大的数据集和进一步的临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中面临注意力泄漏的挑战，影响了语义映射的准确性。

Method: 该方法包含三个核心部分：Query-Query对齐、Key-Value重排和使用重排后的Key-Value进行注意力细化。

Result: 大量的实验和分析验证了Q-Align的有效性。

Conclusion: Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于现有方法，并在保持结构方面具有竞争力。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ERTACache，一个原则性的缓存框架，通过离线残差分析识别可重用步骤，动态调整积分间隔，并分析近似缓存引入的误差，以提高扩散模型的推理速度和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于其迭代推理过程而存在大量的计算开销。特征缓存是一种有希望的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。

Method: 提出ERTACache，通过离线残差分析识别可重用步骤，使用轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔，并通过闭式残差线性化模型分析近似缓存引入的误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现了高达2倍的推理加速，同时保持或甚至提高了视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，ERTACache提供了2倍的加速，且VBench退化最小。

Conclusion: ERTACache能够在积极的缓存重用下实现准确和高效的采样，显著提高效率的同时，有效保持基线保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的任务Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)，旨在提高视频大语言模型对细粒度时间语义的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频大语言模型难以捕捉细粒度的时间语义，因为它们在训练过程中采用稀疏帧采样，并且缺乏足够的帧间推理监督。

Method: TVS 通过保留关键视频片段、将问题同步重构为最直接的形式，并保持答案一致性来预处理视频问答和指令调整数据。TVS 作为一个模块化的前端适配器任务，可以无缝集成到视频指令调整（训练）和视频问答（推理）流程中。

Result: 实验表明，结合 TVS 可以带来 7.33%（训练）和 34.6%（推理）的相对收益。

Conclusion: 时间信息筛选可以有效提高视频语言理解能力。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法依赖于大量的多样化标注数据，而标注数据的获取成本很高。

Method: 提出使用骨骼姿势标注作为一种更高效的标注方法，并构建了一个包含工具姿势和工具实例分割的数据集ROBUST-MIPS。

Result: 通过使用流行的姿势估计方法进行基准测试，观察到高质量的结果，证明了姿势标注对手术工具定位的适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的骨骼姿势标注方法和ROBUST-MIPS数据集，可以促进手术工具定位技术的发展。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control is a plug-and-play safety patch for Text-to-Image (T2I) models that mitigates unsafe content generation while maintaining image quality and text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms in T2I models are susceptible to evasion or require model-specific adjustments.

Method: Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the T2I model using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions.

Result: Safe-Control reduces unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models, outperforming seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: Safe-Control is an effective and adaptable solution for reducing unsafe content generation in T2I models.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [43] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思考的多模态大型语言模型，它能根据问题的复杂性决定何时进行思考，从而提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在解决简单问题时存在过度思考的问题，导致效率低下。

Method: 该论文提出R-4B模型，通过双模退火赋予模型思考和非思考能力，并应用双模策略优化(BPO)来提高模型判断是否激活思考过程的准确性。模型首先在一个精心策划的数据集上进行训练，该数据集包含思考和非思考模式的样本。然后，在改进的GRPO框架下进行第二阶段的训练，其中策略模型被迫为每个输入查询生成来自两种模式的响应。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，在大多数任务中优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，并且在推理密集型基准测试中实现了与更大的模型（如Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B)）相当的性能，同时计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B模型能够自适应地决定何时进行思考，从而在复杂推理问题上取得高性能，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的多模态融合框架HiddenObject，用于检测隐藏或部分隐藏的物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于RGB的检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等不利条件下表现不佳，因此需要更鲁棒、模态不可知的方案。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，从而增强对遮蔽或伪装目标的检测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了HiddenObject，与现有方法相比，表现出最先进或具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构可以显著推进多模态目标检测领域，尤其是在视觉退化或复杂条件下。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT/X-ray registration methods are limited by spatial information loss, domain gap, dense-view requirements and noisy X-rays.

Method: A learning-based RadGS reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism, and a patient-specific pre-training strategy.

Result: State-of-the-art performance for both tasks, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg achieves state-of-the-art performance in vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration by jointly performing 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction and 3D/3D registration, using CAL and a patient-specific pre-training strategy to overcome limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 缺乏公开的大规模带注释数据集，导致自动生成精确且语义丰富的 3D 建筑模型仍然是一个主要挑战。

Method: 通过三种不同的模态表示每个建筑物：语义丰富的 LoD 4 级别的 3D 线框图、相应的楼层平面图图像和类似 LiDAR 的屋顶点云。语义注释从楼层平面图图像中获得。

Result: 构建了一个包含超过 620 万个合成 3D 住宅建筑的数据集。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D 可以用于开发新的生成式 AI 算法，以自动创建 LoD 4 级别的 3D 建筑模型，同时强制执行语义-几何一致性。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉任务中，单应性估计至关重要。当处理带有相机镜头引起的几何畸变的真实图像时，需要同时确定单应性和镜头畸变（特别是径向分量）以获得有用的估计。

Method: 提出了一种新的统一方法，可以解决所有三种径向畸变配置下的单应性估计问题。

Result: 提出的解算器在所有三种情况下都比现有的最先进的解算器更快，同时保持相似的精度。在包括用鱼眼相机拍摄的图像在内的知名基准上测试了解算器。

Conclusion: 本论文提供了一种快速、稳定和准确的最小解算器，用于解决径向畸变单应性问题。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量 (GCAV)，以解决跨层概念不一致的问题，从而实现更稳定和可靠的概念归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量 (CAV) 在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠。

Method: 利用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，并采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的 CAV。

Result: 显著降低了 TCAV 分数的方差，同时保留了概念相关性，增强了概念定位，并提高了对对抗性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过将跨层信息整合到一个连贯的框架中，GCAV 提供了一个更全面和可解释的深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念的理解。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

### [49] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Visual In-Context Prompting (VICP)，一种新的框架，允许在已见过的类别上训练的模型直接推广到未见过的类别，仅使用上下文示例作为提示，而无需参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体重识别(ReID)方法训练特定领域的模型，缺乏泛化能力，并且需要昂贵的标记数据来处理新的类别。自监督学习虽然减少了标注需求，但难以捕捉对ReID至关重要的身份敏感特征。

Method: VICP协同LLM和视觉基础模型(VFM): LLM通过任务特定的提示从少量正/负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM (例如，DINO)通过动态视觉提示提取ID判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K和各种ReID基准上的实验表明，在未见过的类别上，VICP明显优于基线。

Conclusion: 通过将llm衍生的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐，VICP能够推广到新的类别，从而无需数据集特定的重新训练。为了支持评估，我们引入了ShopID10K，这是一个来自电子商务平台的10K对象实例的数据集，具有多视图图像和跨域测试。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 使用 SegResNet 模型在两个 MRI 胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行了训练和评估，结果表明自动分割具有挑战性，需要更大的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确 delineation 对诊断、治疗计划和结果评估至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和有限的数据集可用性，自动分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用 5 折交叉验证与 STAPLE 集成，专注于解剖学相关的感兴趣区域，在 Auto3DSeg 架构中训练 SegResNet 模型。

Result: 在 Task 1 中，算法的 DSC 为 0.56，5 mm DSC 为 0.73，HD95 为 41.1 mm，MASD 为 26.0 mm，RMSE 为 5164 mm。在 Task 2 中，性能下降，DSC 为 0.33，5 mm DSC 为 0.50，HD95 为 20.1 mm，MASD 为 7.2 mm，RMSE 为 17,203 mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果说明了基于 MRI 的胰腺肿瘤分割在小数据集上的挑战，强调了不同 MRI 序列引入的变异性。尽管性能一般，但结果表明了自动 delineation 的潜力，并强调需要更大的标准化 MRI 数据集以提高模型的鲁棒性和临床效用。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的物理驱动方法，用于心脏MRI数据增强和域适应，以从根本上解决泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏磁共振成像(MRI)分割模型难以在不同的成像序列中推广，这是由于图像对比度的显著变化。这些变化是由于成像协议的变化引起的，但相同的基本自旋属性控制着所有获得的图像。

Method: 通过求解由自旋属性的先验分布正则化的不适定非线性反问题，从观察到的心脏MRI图像中反向推断潜在的自旋属性。通过从多参数SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA)数据集中学习生成扩散模型来获得这种“自旋先验”，该数据集提供联合心脏T1和T2图。

Result: Reverse Imaging实现了跨越不同图像对比度和成像协议的高度精确分割，实现了心脏MRI分割的宽光谱泛化。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging能够从MR图像中进行近似但有意义的自旋特性估计，从而提供了一个可解释的“潜在变量”，从而可以高度灵活地合成任意的新序列图像。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Method: 1. 解耦身体形状校准和姿势拟合过程。2. 开发身体形状条件3D姿势先验，通过点扩散Transformer和点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿势拟合。

Conclusion: PHD方法通过利用用户特定身体形状信息和3D姿势先验，有效提高了3D人体姿势估计的准确性和精度。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态方面表现出强大的能力，但其迭代性和多假设需求导致巨大的计算成本。

Method: 该框架采用分层时间剪枝（HTP）策略，该策略以分阶段的自上而下的方式运行：（1）时间相关性增强剪枝（TCEP）通过自适应时间图构建分析帧间运动相关性来识别重要帧；（2）稀疏聚焦时间MHSA（SFT MHSA）利用由此产生的帧级稀疏性来减少注意力计算，专注于运动相关的token；（3）掩码引导姿态Token剪枝器（MGPTP）通过聚类执行细粒度的语义剪枝，仅保留信息量最大的姿态token。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP上的实验表明，与之前的基于扩散的方法相比，HTP将训练MAC减少了38.5％，推理MAC减少了56.8％，并将推理速度平均提高了81.1％，同时实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的框架，可以在减少计算成本的同时保持或提高3D人体姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Print2Volume，一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真的、合成的基于OCT的3D指纹的框架，以解决OCT数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于OCT数据采集成本高、耗时，缺乏大规模公共数据集，严重阻碍了先进算法的发展，特别是数据需求大的深度学习模型。

Method: 该框架分三个阶段运行：（1）2D风格转换模块，将二值指纹转换为模仿Z方向平均投影OCT扫描风格的灰度图像；（2）3D结构扩展网络，将2D图像外推到合理的3D解剖体积；（3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器，使用真实的纹理、散斑噪声和其他成像特征渲染结构体积。

Result: 使用Print2Volume生成了一个包含420,000个样本的大规模合成数据集。定量实验表明，合成数据的质量很高，并且对识别性能有显著影响。通过在合成数据上预训练识别模型，并在小型真实数据集上对其进行微调，在ZJUT-EIFD基准测试中，等错误率（EER）从15.62%显著降低至2.50%。

Conclusion: 该方法在克服数据稀缺性方面非常有效

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 手动分析手术录像非常耗时。为了改善这种情况，人们正在积极开发更复杂的计算机视觉和机器学习方法。由于大多数此类方法严重依赖样本数据，尤其是在医疗领域，而这些数据非常稀少。

Method: 与该领域领先的医学专家合作创建图像数据集，其中包含子宫内膜异位症（一种常见的医学疾病，即子宫样组织的脱位）的基于区域的注释。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

TL;DR: 本文研究了腹腔镜妇科手术视频中手术器械的分割和识别，重点在于使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的器械分割和器械识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术录像已成为医学内窥镜领域越来越重要的信息来源，但自动内容索引仍然是一个巨大的挑战，因为视频内容非常特殊。

Method: 使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的器械分割和器械识别。

Result: 即使在训练样本数量适中偏低的情况下，也能够以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域。然而，由于手术器械inherently的高度相似性，确定特定器械仍然非常具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 本文表明，在手术器械分割方面取得了较好的效果，但在器械识别方面仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种通用框架，用于生成WSI的2D索引图，并为特定应用领域提供分析机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI算法的训练或验证中，了解WSI上的内容至关重要。目前缺乏WSI元数据的标准，主要通过手动检查进行选择，不适用于大型集合。

Method: 该方法通过详细的组织图谱来增强每个WSI集合，该图谱提供关于WSI内容的细粒度信息。组织图谱分为三层：来源、组织类型和病理改变，每一层将WSI的片段分配给特定的类别。

Result: 通过在WSI目录、机器学习和基于图的WSI表示中的具体例子，展示了所提出的标准的优点和适用性。

Conclusion: 本研究为WSI建立了一个标准化的元数据框架，可以更有效地管理和利用这些图像，特别是在AI算法的开发和验证中。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督增量学习方法，使用基于置信度的伪标签，用伪标签代替人工标注，从而能够从无标签数据集中进行增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，经常会出现训练期间未见过的新类别，需要模型逐步获取新知识。然而，现有的类增量学习（CIL）方法假设增量数据集是完全标记的，这在实践中是不现实的。

Method: 将这些伪标签集成到各种 CIL 方法中，并基于置信度进行选择，在 CIFAR100 和 ImageNet100 上评估性能下降。将其与解决类似挑战的流行的类增量新类别发现（class-iNCD）方法进行比较。此外，将该方法应用于细粒度数据集，以证明其在现实世界中的实用性，并测量其计算复杂性，以验证其是否适合资源受限的环境。

Result: 与监督方法相比，ICPL 取得了具有竞争力的结果，并且在最终准确率方面优于最先进的 class-iNCD 方法 5% 以上。

Conclusion: ICPL 是一种有效的无监督增量学习方法，在各种数据集上都表现出色，并且适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Motivation: 合成医学数据在训练模型方面具有可扩展性，但与真实临床环境存在差距，影响泛化能力。本文旨在解决合成和真实X射线图像之间跨域转换的难题。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，该模型基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges，学习一个共享的领域无关潜在空间，支持在训练期间看到的任何域对之间的无缝转换。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift模型尺寸小于基于扩散的方法，但性能强大，并且在推理时具有灵活性，可以调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的领域自适应提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树木覆盖或树冠高度，没有明确识别个体水平的树木，而大规模监测个体树木仍然受到不足的建模限制。

Method: 该方法使用可扩展大小的高斯核模拟树冠，提取树冠中心并生成二元树木覆盖图。使用从机载激光雷达数据自动提取的数十亿个点进行训练。

Result: 该模型在森林内外成功识别树木，并与现有的树木覆盖图和机载激光雷达进行了比较，具有最先进的性能（分数覆盖率R$^2 = 0.81$）。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可扩展的全球高分辨率树木监测框架，并且可以适应未来提供改进影像的卫星任务。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景下的3D高斯溅射由于数据量大和训练时间长而存在局限性。

Method: 采用基于锚点的分层结构组织高斯球，粗糙层代表低分辨率结构，精细层由粗糙层激活。引入混合变形和生成策略，通过高斯变形建模帧间运动，并触发高斯生成来表征大范围运动。双向自适应掩蔽机制通过移除静态区域和优先考虑信息量大的视角来提高训练效率。

Result: 在显著减少训练时间的同时，实现了优于现有技术的视觉质量。

Conclusion: \M 实现了优越的视觉质量，同时显著减少了训练时间。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 1. 实现一个基于125M参数语言模型的专家模型，比LLaMA-7B小56倍；2. 通过实验分析模型在视觉盲区上的问题，发现问题源于无效的注意力机制和有限的视觉表征；3. 提出了一个名为Sharp-Eyed Refinement的新颖描述框架，通过改进的视觉基础来提高描述质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出的轻量级图像描述专家模型和Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，为在本地设备上部署高性能图像描述模型提供了可能性。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to

Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注单一技术或特定类型OOD数据集，忽略了结合多种解决方案的潜力。

Method: 理论和实验证明了特征截断和评分函数可以有效结合，并提出多方法集成(MME)评分。

Result: MME在各种基准测试中显著优于现有技术，在ImageNet-1K上实现了27.57%的平均FPR95。

Conclusion: MME通过统一最先进的OOD检测器，形成一个更有效的评分函数。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有的基于遥感图像的舰船检测技术容易受到对抗补丁攻击的影响，而过度增强图像背景或不相关区域可能导致不必要的干扰和错误检测。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上进行的实验表明，该方法有效地提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率，并增强了它们的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 所提出的局部增强方法能够提高对抗补丁攻击的成功率和可迁移性。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

*Hao Lu,Jiahao Wang,Yaolun Zhang,Ruohui Wang,Xuanyu Zheng,Yepeng Tang,Dahua Lin,Lewei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark, ELV-Halluc, to study semantic aggregation hallucination (SAH) in long videos, a type of hallucination where models generate incorrect outputs despite having correct frame-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video hallucination benchmarks are limited to short videos and oversimplify the causes of hallucinations, especially in long videos with complex semantics.

Method: The authors created the ELV-Halluc benchmark for long-video hallucination and used it to analyze SAH. They also explored mitigation strategies like positional encoding and DPO, curating a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs to improve model performance.

Result: Experiments confirmed the existence of SAH, showing it increases with semantic complexity and rapid semantic changes. Positional encoding and DPO strategies reduced SAH, with a 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio achieved.

Conclusion: The paper identifies and addresses the issue of semantic aggregation hallucination in long videos, introducing a new benchmark and demonstrating the effectiveness of positional encoding and DPO strategies in mitigating this problem.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 现有的基于视觉变换器的特征基础模型在处理显微图像时，难以兼顾计算效率和精细特征表示，尤其是在材料和生物图像分析的大图像尺寸下。

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，参考输入图像，对低分辨率的基础模型特征进行上采样。

Result: 该方法可以有效地对多种显微图像进行特征化和分割，包括植物细胞、锂离子电池正极和有机晶体。上采样后的特征能够分离难以分割的相位，如发际线裂缝。交互式分割结果表明，与训练或微调传统的卷积网络相比，该方法能更快地生成高质量的分割结果，且所需标签更少。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升低分辨率基础模型特征，实现对显微图像的高效分割，并在交互式分割中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的用于自然语言引导无人机的分层跨粒度对比和匹配学习框架（HCCM），以解决无人机场景中视觉语言理解的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流视觉语言模型缺乏细粒度语义，现有的分层方法依赖于精确的实体分割和严格的包含关系，限制了在动态环境中的有效性。无人机文本描述通常不完整或模棱两可，从而破坏了对齐。

Method: 提出了分层跨粒度对比和匹配学习框架（HCCM），包含两个组件：(1) 区域-全局图像-文本对比学习 (RG-ITC)，通过对比局部视觉区域与全局文本以及反之亦然，来避免精确的场景分割并捕获分层局部到全局的语义；(2) 区域-全局图像-文本匹配 (RG-ITM)，它不采用严格的约束，而是在全局跨模态表示中评估局部语义一致性，从而增强组合推理。引入了一种动量对比和蒸馏 (MCD) 机制来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在 GeoText-1652 数据集上，HCCM 实现了最先进的 Recall@1，图像检索为 28.8%，文本检索为 14.7%。在未见过的 ERA 数据集上，HCCM 表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，平均召回率 (mR) 为 39.93%，优于微调的基线。

Conclusion: HCCM 框架有效地提升了自然语言引导无人机任务中视觉语言理解的性能，并在零样本泛化能力上表现出色。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用潜在扩散模型从单张图像重建完整3D场景（包括遮挡部分）的高斯溅射方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在预测遮挡和视锥外表面时采用回归方法，导致模糊、不合理，无法捕捉多种可能的解释。现有方法通常只能部分解决问题，例如孤立对象、仅重建可见表面或无法从输入视图推断。

Method: 提出了一种生成式方法，学习以单个输入图像为条件的高斯溅射3D表示分布。为了解决缺乏ground-truth训练数据的问题，提出了一个变分自重构器，以自监督的方式仅从2D图像中学习潜在空间，并在该空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: 该方法能够生成忠实的重建和多样化的样本，并能完成遮挡表面的高质量360度渲染。

Conclusion: 总结：该论文提出了一种新颖的3D场景补全方法，利用潜在扩散模型和变分自重构器，实现了从单张图像生成完整、高质量的3D场景，包括遮挡区域。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

### [71] [EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21550)
*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EZ-Sort的方法，该方法利用CLIP模型进行预排序，并通过自动化比较来减少人工标注工作量，从而提高pairwise ranking的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在主观或困难的标注任务中，pairwise comparison由于其更高的可靠性而优于绝对评级或顺序分类。然而，详尽的比较需要大量的标注。

Method: 该方法首先生成一个基于CLIP的zero-shot预排序，然后初始化bucket-aware Elo scores，最后运行一个uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort。

Result: 实验结果表明，与详尽的pairwise comparisons相比，EZ-Sort减少了90.5%的人工标注成本，与之前的工作相比减少了19.8%（当n=100时），同时提高了或保持了inter-rater reliability。

Conclusion: 结合基于CLIP的先验知识和uncertainty-aware sampling，可以为pairwise ranking提供一个高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

TL;DR: ECHO: 从头部和手腕追踪建模人与物体的交互，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于智能眼镜和手表等可穿戴设备的日益普及，从以自我为中心的角度对人与物体的交互 (HOI) 进行建模是一个很大程度上尚未被探索但很重要的问题。

Method: ECHO 采用扩散 Transformer 架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，该过程共同建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列，从而允许灵活的输入配置。我们的方法在以头部为中心的规范空间中运行，从而增强了对全局方向的鲁棒性。我们提出了一种基于传送带的推理，它可以随着帧位置逐渐增加扩散时间戳，从而使我们能够处理任何长度的序列。

Result: 通过广泛的评估，我们证明 ECHO 优于不提供相同灵活性的现有方法，在以自我为中心的 HOI 重建中建立了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: ECHO 首次提出了一个统一的框架，可以从这种最小的观察中恢复三种模态：人体姿势、物体运动和接触。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了通用视觉语言模型（VLM）在城市环境中的表现，发现它们在零样本设置下表现尚可，但在使用合成数据集进行微调后，性能显著提高，尤其是在否定和反事实等具有挑战性的问题类型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在理解城市场景中的物体、布局和深度线索等细粒度空间推理能力方面仍有不足。

Method: 构建了一个合成VQA数据集，该数据集包含街景图像的分割、深度和物体检测预测，并将每个问题与LLM生成的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）答案配对，以进行逐步推理监督，然后使用该数据集对三个现成的VLM（BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5）进行微调。

Result: 结果表明，使用合成CoT监督数据集进行微调可以显著提高VLM的性能，尤其是在否定和反事实等具有挑战性的问题类型上。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了城市空间推理作为VLM的新挑战，并证明了合成数据集构建是将通用模型适应于专门领域的有效途径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时间流匹配（TFM）方法，用于医学图像预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学影像时间动态分析中存在局限性，无法进行细粒度的空间预测，且常受限于单时间点、特定疾病或技术限制。

Method: TFM 是一种统一的生成轨迹方法，旨在学习潜在的时间分布，可以退化为最近图像预测器，并支持 3D 图像、多重先验扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的大量基准测试表明，TFM 始终优于自然成像的时空方法，为 4D 医学图像预测建立了新的最先进且稳健的基线。

Conclusion: TFM 方法在 4D 医学图像预测方面表现出色，具有重要研究意义。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从单词级 OCR 到行级 OCR 的自然演进方法，以绕过单词检测中的错误，并为更好地利用语言模型提供更大的句子上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 OCR 技术容易在字符分割中出错，并且缺乏利用语言模型的上下文。单词级 OCR 将精度瓶颈转移到单词分割。因此，本文旨在通过行级 OCR 来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种行级 OCR 方法，该方法可以绕过单词检测中的错误，并为更好地利用语言模型提供更大的句子上下文。

Result: 实验结果表明，端到端精度提高了 5.4%，效率提高了 4 倍。

Conclusion: 行级 OCR 具有巨大的潜力，尤其是在文档图像处理方面。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 本研究旨在通过整合术前CT影像和术后组织病理全切片图像(WSI)，评估多模态复发预测在透明细胞肾细胞癌(ccRCC)中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分在远处复发风险分层中应用广泛，但患者水平分辨率有限，且不包含影像信息。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，包含预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，并测试了单模态、晚期融合和中期融合设置。

Result: 基于WSI的模型始终优于仅使用CT的模型，强调了病理学的预后强度。中期融合进一步提高了性能，最佳模型(TITAN-CONCH与ResNet-18)接近调整后的Leibovich评分。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于基础模型的多模态整合用于个体化ccRCC风险预测是可行的。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的CGH算法存在黑盒模型、感受野有限和近场约束等问题，导致重建精度和稳定性不足。

Method: 该论文提出的DUN算法将梯度下降分解为自适应带宽保持模型（ABPM）和相位域复值去噪器（PCD）两个模块。ABPM 扩展了工作距离，PCD 利用复值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的实验表明，该算法实现了state-of-the-art的结果，PSNR超过35dB。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的DUN算法能够有效提高CGH重建的精度和灵活性，并在实验中取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET/CT在肿瘤成像中很重要，但病灶分割因示踪剂异质性、生理摄取和多中心差异而具有挑战性。临床实践需要能够有效改进预测mask的方法。

Method: 在autoPET III nnU-Net的基础上，通过将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外的输入通道，扩展了框架的promptable能力。研究了空间提示的表示方法，并提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略。

Result: 基于欧几里得距离变换（EDT）编码的模型优于高斯核，使用内外部数据训练的EDT模型集成实现了最强的交叉验证性能，减少了假阳性和假阴性。

Conclusion: Promptable模型有潜力在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效、用户引导的分割工作流程。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的高清地图构建方法，通过概率投影机制和置信度评分，提高了地图的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 现有模型依赖于资源密集型的大规模扩散模型的完全微调，需要企业级GPU和数千张合成图像。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)进行微调。

Result: 在七个不同的目标检测数据集上进行评估，结果表明，仅使用500张合成图像训练目标检测器，即可获得优于ODGEN基线5000张合成图像的检测性能，mAP@.50:.95提高了21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA以10%的数据和一小部分计算成本实现了卓越的性能，表明质量和效率至上的方法比蛮力生成更有效，使合成数据创建更实用。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. This paper shows that adversarial perturbations create detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs.

Method: Using parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, demonstrate that adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy in early convolutional layers.

Result: Adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates below 20%.

Conclusion: CNN reliability can be assessed through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Motivation: 现有的LVLMs在处理现实场景中DMDs的图像时，如存在杂乱、遮挡、极端视角和运动模糊等情况，表现不佳，尤其是在头戴式相机和增强现实（AR）应用中。

Method: 利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术，CAD2DMD-SET生成多样化的、带有VQA标签的合成DMD数据集，用于微调LVLMs。DMDBench包含1000张带注释的真实世界图像，用于评估模型在实际约束下的性能。

Result: 使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据集对三个最先进的LVLMs进行微调，显著提高了模型性能。InternVL的ANLS评分提高了200%，且未在其他任务上出现性能下降。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET训练数据集能够显著提高LVLMs在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和性能。CAD2DMD-SET工具预计将开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的视觉声源定位方法，通过引入 silence 和 noise 的训练策略，提高了模型在正负音频情况下的性能。同时，论文还提出了一个新的评估指标，用于量化音频和视觉特征在正负音频-视觉对齐和分离之间的权衡。此外，论文还发布了一个扩展和改进的合成数据集 IS3+，其中包含负音频。

Motivation: 当前视觉声源定位方法在低音频-视觉语义对应（如 silence, noise 和 offscreen sounds）的情况下表现不佳，并且之前的评估主要集中在单一可见声源的场景中。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的训练策略，将 silence 和 noise 纳入考量，从而提高了模型在正音频情况下的性能，并增强了对负音频的鲁棒性。提出的自监督模型 SSL-SaN 在声音定位和跨模态检索方面都达到了最先进的性能。此外，还提出了一个新的指标，用于量化正负音频-视觉对的听觉和视觉特征的对齐和分离之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入新的训练策略和评估指标，以及发布包含负音频的扩展数据集，解决了当前视觉声源定位方法在处理负音频方面的不足。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.
  Our data, metrics and code are available on the

TL;DR: UItron是一个开源的GUI代理基础模型，它具有先进的GUI感知、定位和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足和基础模型初始能力有限等挑战。本文旨在构建一个具有更强中文应用交互能力的GUI代理。

Method: UItron采用监督式微调进行感知和规划任务，并开发了一个课程强化学习框架，以实现复杂推理和在线环境探索。同时，系统地研究了一系列数据工程策略，并建立了一个连接移动和PC设备的交互环境。

Result: UItron在GUI感知、定位和规划的基准测试中取得了优异的性能，尤其是在与中国顶级移动应用的交互方面表现突出。

Conclusion: UItron的出现推动了GUI代理向实际应用迈进了一步，特别是在中文应用场景下取得了显著进展。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

### [85] [Domain Generalization in-the-Wild: Disentangling Classification from Domain-Aware Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21769)
*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP在域泛化（DG）方面的性能，提出了一种新的评估方法，并通过实验发现CLIP在OOD数据集上的性能显著下降。为解决这个问题，本文提出了一种名为CLIP-DCA的方法，该方法通过增强领域感知表示和解耦领域特征来实现更好的域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对CLIP等基础模型的域泛化评估可能不够具有挑战性，无法充分测试真实未见数据场景。

Method: 1) 在ImageNet上微调CLIP后，在33个具有量化OOD分数的不同数据集上进行评估；2) 使用unlearning使CLIP“忘记”某些域作为近似。提出CLIP-DCA，通过分离分类和增强的领域感知表示来提高性能。

Result: CLIP在更OOD的数据集上性能显著下降。CLIP-DCA在具有挑战性的评估中显示出显著的改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型中有效领域不变分类的先决条件。CLIP-DCA通过在CLIP的编码器中识别和增强领域感知，并鼓励与领域特征分离的领域不变分类，从而实现更好的域泛化性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了非典型视频数据在开放世界学习中的应用，发现使用非典型数据可以提高模型在 OOD 检测、NCD 和 ZSAR 等任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在封闭集合中的常见典型数据，而开放世界中的新颖发现（尤其是在视频中）尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究在学习过程中暴露不寻常的非典型视频会发生什么。

Method: 本文收集了一个新的视频数据集，其中包含各种类型的非典型数据（例如科幻、动画等），并将其用于模型训练过程以进行表征学习。重点关注开放世界学习中的三个关键任务：OOD 检测、NCD 和 ZSAR。

Result: 研究发现，即使使用非典型数据的直接学习方法也能持续提高各种设置下的性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性进一步提高了 OOD 检测性能。在 NCD 任务中，使用较小但语义更多样化的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的样本集能带来更好的性能。在 ZSAR 设置中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地推广到看不见的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频有益于开放世界中的视觉表征学习，并提出了一个新的数据集，鼓励在该方向上进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

### [87] [Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773)
*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种现实的无监督视频学习场景，其中在学习一系列任务时既不提供任务边界也不提供标签。同时，为尚未充分探索的无监督视频持续学习问题提供了一种非参数学习解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究只关注有监督的持续学习，依赖于标签和任务边界的知识，而有标签的数据是昂贵的且不实用的。为了解决这个差距，我们研究了无监督视频持续学习（uVCL）。与图像相比，处理视频需要额外的计算和内存，这给uVCL带来了更多的挑战。

Method: 我们提出使用无监督视频transformer网络提取的深度嵌入视频特征的核密度估计（KDE）作为数据的非参数概率表示。我们引入了一种新颖性检测标准，用于检测传入的新任务数据，动态地扩展内存集群，旨在捕获在学习一系列任务时的新知识。我们利用从先前任务的迁移学习作为知识转移到当前学习任务的初始状态。

Result: 我们发现，当连续学习多个任务时，所提出的方法能够显著提高模型的性能。

Conclusion: 我们在三个标准的视频动作识别数据集上进行了深入评估，包括UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2，没有使用任何标签或类别边界。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于nnU-Net框架的胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)MRI自动分割方法，该方法利用深度多阶段级联预训练策略，并结合了数据增强和模型集成技术，在PANTHER挑战赛中取得了优异的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)MRI自动分割对于临床工作流程至关重要，但由于肿瘤组织对比度差和带注释的数据稀缺而受到阻碍。

Method: 该方法基于nnU-Net框架，并采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略，从一般解剖学基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过广泛的五重交叉验证，系统地评估了数据增强方案和训练计划。

Result: 分析表明，过度的数据增强产生最高的体积精度，而默认的增强产生优越的边界精度。通过构建自定义的异构专家模型集成，实现了Task 1的肿瘤Dice评分0.661和Task 2的0.523。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专用高性能模型的稳健方法。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学方面表现优于先前的模型，但在临床实施前仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5在临床决策支持方面的潜力，尤其是在肿瘤学中的应用。

Method: 使用ACR放射肿瘤学在职培训考试和一组真实的放射肿瘤学病例对GPT-5的性能进行评估。由放射肿瘤学家评估治疗方案的正确性、全面性和幻觉，并使用Fleiss' Kappa量化评估者间信度。

Result: GPT-5在TXIT基准测试中表现优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，平均准确率为92.8%。在病例评估中，GPT-5的治疗建议在正确性和全面性方面获得了很高的评价，幻觉很少见。评估者间一致性较低。

Conclusion: GPT-5在生成放射肿瘤治疗方案建议方面表现良好，但仍有改进空间。在临床实施之前，需要严格的专家监督。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于统一结构和逻辑异常检测的三记忆框架(TMUAD)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于可用的正常数据量有限，异常检测具有挑战性。

Method: 构建类级文本记忆库以进行逻辑异常检测；构建对象级图像记忆库，以保留完整的对象轮廓；使用视觉编码器提取patch级图像特征，以构建patch级记忆库，用于结构异常检测。

Result: 在涉及工业和医疗领域的七个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Motivation: 在视频理解中，根据细粒度的定位掩码和详细的语义属性来理解视频中的对象是一项基本任务。获取此任务的数据繁琐且昂贵。

Method: 提出使用伪对象字幕来注释现有的segmentation数据集(SAV)。通过预处理具有ground-truth掩码的视频以突出感兴趣的对象，并将其馈送到大型视觉语言模型(VLM)。

Result: 在指代表达式视频对象分割方面产生state-of-the-art结果，在半监督视频对象分割方面具有竞争力，并为视频对象字幕建立基准。

Conclusion: 提出了VoCap模型和SAV-Caption数据集，并在多个任务上取得了state-of-the-art或有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了场景识别中的verb分类任务，认为其应该被视为一个单正多标签学习(SPMLL)问题。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了一个名为GE-VerbMLP的模型，并在多个数据集上进行了实验，结果表明该模型在MAP指标上取得了超过3%的提升。

Motivation: 现有的场景识别方法将verb分类视为一个单标签问题，但是作者认为这种方法无法解决视觉事件识别中固有的模糊性，因为多个verb类别可能合理地描述同一图像。

Method: 作者首先通过实证分析揭示了verb分类本质上是一个多标签问题。然后，作者将verb分类重新定义为一个单正多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，并提出了Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP)模型，该模型结合了图神经网络来捕获标签相关性，并使用对抗训练来优化决策边界。此外，作者还设计了一个综合的多标签评估基准，用于公平地评估模型在多标签环境中的性能。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，作者的方法在MAP指标上取得了超过3%的提升，同时在传统的top-1和top-5准确率指标上保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文重新定义了场景识别中的verb分类任务，并提出了一个名为GE-VerbMLP的模型来解决这个问题。实验结果表明该模型在多个数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶benchmark在处理复杂交通规则和罕见场景时存在局限性，无法全面评估LLM的驾驶知识。

Method: 构建了一个包含文本和视觉信息的DriveQA benchmark，并在其上评估了LLM和多模态LLM的表现。通过微调和控制变量分析，研究了模型在不同环境因素下的敏感性。

Result: LLM在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局上存在明显不足。在DriveQA上进行微调可以提高准确性。预训练DriveQA可以提高下游驾驶任务的性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA能够有效评估和提高LLM的驾驶知识，并且模型可以内化文本和合成交通知识，从而有效地推广到下游QA任务。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on

### [94] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究架构归纳偏差如何影响大型语言模型（LLM）在教学对话中的认知行为。引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，以促进苏格拉底辅导中的自适应、结构化推理。通过五种系统变体的受控消融，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，涵盖支架、响应性、符号推理和对话记忆。使用基于LLM的评估框架，该框架与认知基础的评分标准相一致，展示了初步结果。这使得早期实验中跨架构变体的可扩展、系统比较成为可能。初步结果表明，完整的系统始终优于基线变体。分析表明，移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键的认知行为，包括抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性。这些发现支持一种处理层面的解释，即架构支架可以可靠地塑造LLM中涌现的教学策略。

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在教学对话中的认知行为如何受到架构归纳偏差的影响，并提升LLM的教学能力。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，并通过五种系统变体的受控消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准和基于LLM的评估框架评估模型输出。

Result: 完整的系统始终优于基线变体。移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键的认知行为，包括抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性。

Conclusion: 架构支架可以可靠地塑造LLM中涌现的教学策略。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

TL;DR: LINKO: 使用LLM增强的综合本体学习框架，通过双轴知识传播同时利用多个本体图，以增强医学概念表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在整合来自单个本体系统或多个本体系统的领域知识，而没有将它们整合到一个统一的学习结构中，概念表示学习通常仍然局限于本体内部关系，忽略了跨本体连接。

Method: LINKO首先利用LLM为本体概念嵌入提供图检索增强初始化，然后通过在两个轴上执行知识传播来联合学习不同本体图中的医学概念：(1)跨层级本体级别的本体内垂直传播；(2)在每个级别内并行进行本体间水平传播。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的大量实验验证了LINKO相对于现有技术的优越性能。

Conclusion: LINKO作为与现有EHR预测模型兼容的插件编码器，进一步证明了在涉及有限数据可用性和罕见疾病预测的情况下，LINKO具有更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 擅长复杂的推理任务，但在简单的交互任务中表现不佳。本文提出了“游戏中思考 (TiG)”框架，该框架使 LLM 能够通过与游戏环境的直接交互来发展程序理解，同时保留其固有的推理和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 擅长复杂的推理任务，但在简单的交互任务中表现不佳。这突出了陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距。传统强化学习 (RL) 智能体可以通过环境交互获得程序性知识，但它们通常作为黑盒运行，并且需要大量的训练数据。LLM 拥有广泛的世界知识和推理能力，但无法有效地将这种静态知识转化为交互环境中的动态决策。

Method: 将基于 RL 的决策制定重新表述为语言建模任务：LLM 生成语言引导的策略，这些策略通过基于环境反馈的在线强化学习迭代改进。

Result: TiG 成功弥合了陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的差距，与传统的 RL 方法相比，以更低的数据和计算需求实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: TiG 为其决策提供了逐步的自然语言解释，大大提高了复杂交互任务的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM: a benchmark that aggregates various datasets to holistically measure the performance of ALMs across 10 aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of standardized benchmarks for Audio-Language Models (ALMs).

Method: Introduce AHELM, a benchmark that aggregates various datasets, standardizes the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, but exhibits group unfairness on ASR tasks. Baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM.

Conclusion: AHELM is intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added over time.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识管理中的遗忘操作，由于各种原因，会有意忽略agent的部分知识和信念。遗忘有很多方面，可能想要忘记部分语法、命题或条件。

Method: 从认知角度出发，研究了在具有更丰富语义结构的认知状态下的遗忘操作，但与命题逻辑有清晰的联系。提出了五种一般类型的认知遗忘，并用七个具体的遗忘操作来实例化它们，用于Spohn的排序函数。

Conclusion: 对遗忘操作进行了全面的评估，并展示了它们之间的差异和共性。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何从随机状态-动作轨迹中学习滑块拼图的提升STRIPS模型，其中状态仅表示瓦片的位置，动作是上、下、左和右的标签，没有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的方法已经解决了这个模型学习问题的不同版本，但是大多数假设轨迹中的动作是完整的STRIPS动作，或者域谓词都是可观察的。本文考虑的新设置更“现实”，因为观察到的原子传递了世界的状态，但不是完整的STRIPS状态，并且动作揭示了选择动作所需的参数，而不是在STRIPS中建模所需的参数。

Method: 为了公式化和解决学习问题，我们引入了STRIPS的一种变体，我们称之为STRIPS+，其中某些STRIPS动作参数可以在前提条件中保持隐式，前提条件也可以涉及有限形式的存在量化。学习问题变成了从STRIPS+状态-动作轨迹中学习STRIPS+模型的问题。为此，所提出的学习算法SYNTH为每个动作构建前提条件表达式或“查询”的分层序列（合取），这些表达式或“查询”表示状态中的唯一对象并在STRIPS+中确定隐式动作参数。

Result: 建立了SYNTH的正确性和完整性，并在从现有STRIPS域导出的STRIPS+模型获得的状态-动作轨迹上测试了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: 学习STRIPS+模型是可行的，并且SYNTH算法是正确、完整且可扩展的。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态浏览基准，旨在解决现有基准测试中存在的浅层、固定工作流程问题，这些工作流程依赖于高召回率的图像搜索和附近的文本掩码。该基准包含311个任务，这些任务需要高度的多模态理解，同时保留了强大的纯文本浏览套件的难度特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态语言模型（MLLM）越来越多地被部署为网络代理，但许多多模态浏览基准可以通过浅层的、固定的工作流程来解决，这些工作流程依赖于高召回率的图像搜索和附近的文本掩码，而无法真正解决细粒度的视觉推理、来源验证和长期工具使用等多模态挑战。

Method: 我们引入了一种名为“空间-时间推断”的策展程序，该程序的问题种子需要从空间线索（微文本、局部外观、布局、标牌）和时间痕迹（广播覆盖、季节性背景）推断出图像之外的事实，例如事件、日期和地点。我们提供了一个与模型无关的代理框架，其中包含浏览工具，并评估了一系列封闭和开放的MLLM。

Result: 最强的代理（o3）在没有搜索的情况下达到15.1%，在我们的框架下进行推广后达到36.0%的准确率，而一个强大的开源模型（Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct）在没有搜索的情况下达到0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。

Conclusion: 除了答案准确性之外，我们还评估了边界框的生成和裁剪图像搜索，并进行了错误分析，揭示了在来源验证、基于部分的推理和长期规划方面的失败。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前衡量智慧的方法依赖于自我报告，很少反映智慧推理中固有的谦逊和不确定性。需要一种能够考虑多维性和自信度的计算框架。

Method: 使用模糊推理系统和Z数字，将参与者对文化中立的道德困境的语言反应映射到五个智慧组成部分，并使用21条规则和高斯核密度估计调整隶属函数。

Result: 该系统产生了双重属性智慧表征，与已建立的量表适度相关，且与无关特征关系不大，支持了收敛和发散效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为一种多维的、具有不确定性意识的结构，并以Z数字的形式进行操作。该方法可以为人工智能系统提供可解释的、对置信度敏感的推理，从而在严格计算和类人判断之间提供一个安全的中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Result: 本文表明，生成反事实情景通常与计算P的计划一样昂贵，从而证明了该提议的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个构建该领域实用算法的框架。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个GenAI框架，旨在简化医疗保健和流行病学中的过程挖掘应用，通过围绕现有的Python (PM4PY)和R (bupaR)库提供一个全面的包装器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘是理解复杂医疗工作流程的强大分析技术。然而，它的应用面临着重大障碍，包括技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法以及获取实际培训资源的途径有限。

Method: HealthProcessAI框架集成了多个大型语言模型(llm)，用于自动过程图解释和报告生成，帮助将技术分析转化为不同的用户可以轻松理解的输出。

Result: 该框架成功地跨四个概念验证场景处理了败血症数据，证明了强大的技术性能及其通过自动LLM分析生成报告的能力。当通过自动LLM评估器评估时，LLM评估显示了不同的模型优势:Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得了最高的一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 通过集成多个大型语言模型(llm)进行自动解释和报告生成，该框架解决了对过程挖掘输出的广泛陌生，使临床医生、数据科学家和研究人员更容易访问它们。这种结构化的分析和人工智能驱动的解释相结合，代表了一种新颖的方法学进步，即将复杂的过程挖掘结果转化为医疗保健应用中潜在的可操作的见解。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

### [108] [Revisiting Landmarks: Learning from Previous Plans to Generalize over Problem Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21564)
*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，用于发现能够自动跨领域泛化的地标。这些地标是从一组已解决的实例中学习得到的，并描述了规划问题的中间目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的地标提取算法在规划问题中存在局限性，因此需要一种新的方法来发现更有效的地标。

Method: 该方法使用独立于特定问题对象的state functions，并将其应用于所有相似对象，从而捕获重复模式。基于这些函数，构建一个有向的广义地标图，用于定义地标的进展，包括重复子计划的循环可能性。

Result: 从少量小实例中学习到的广义地标图对于同一领域中较大的实例也有效。如果识别出指示重复的循环，则启发式性能相比基线有显着提高。

Conclusion: 广义地标能够捕获可解释且对自动规划器有用的领域信息，并且可以从同一领域的一小组计划中发现这些信息。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种确定性去中心化 POMDP (Det-Dec-POMDPs)，它是 Dec-POMDPs 的一个子类，其特征在于确定性转换和以状态和联合动作为条件的观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高级多智能体规划问题，包括多机器人导航和路径规划，可以使用确定性动作和观察来有效建模。

Method: 提出了一种名为迭代确定性 POMDP 规划 (IDPP) 的实用求解器。该方法建立在经典策略联合均衡搜索框架的基础上，并经过专门优化，以处理当前 Dec-POMDP 求解器无法有效处理的大规模 Det-Dec-POMDP。

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥合复杂运筹学输出与业务利益相关者理解之间的差距，通过生成自然语言摘要、上下文可视化和定制的关键绩效指标 (KPI)。

Conclusion: 未来的扩展包括集成私有 LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络，以增强可解释性、适应性和实时决策能力。

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种随时版本的MHA*算法，可以在时间允许的范围内快速找到可行的次优解并不断改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的MHA*算法无法随着时间的推移改进解决方案，并且需要仔细设置膨胀因子才能获得所需的一次性解决方案。

Method: 通过将ARA*算法的概念精确地应用于MHA*框架，扩展MHA*到随时版本。

Result: 在3-D路径规划领域和滑动拼图游戏中，A-MHA*的性能优于MHA*和其他随时算法。

Conclusion: 对ARA*概念在MHA*框架中的精确应用，保留了原始的次优性和完整性保证，并增强了MHA*以随时执行。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MEDLEY框架，利用AI模型的多样性输出，将偏见视为潜在优势，而非缺陷，以增强临床监督下的医疗推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为医疗人工智能的偏见是缺陷，需要消除。但人类推理本身就包含受教育、文化和经验影响的偏见，因此AI偏见可能不可避免且有潜在价值。

Method: 提出MEDLEY框架，该框架协调多个AI模型，保留其多样化的输出，并将模型特有的偏见记录为潜在优势，将幻觉视为临床医生验证的临时假设。使用30多个大型语言模型开发了一个概念验证演示器。

Result: 通过构建概念验证演示器，在合成案例中保留共识和少数意见，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明化。结果表明，结构化多样性可以增强临床医生监督下的医疗推理。

Conclusion: 通过将AI的不完善视为一种资源，MEDLEY提供了一种范式转变，为开发可信赖的医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PosterForest: A novel training-free framework for automated scientific poster generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic integration of textual and visual elements.

Method: Introducing the Poster Tree, a hierarchical intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and visual-textual relationships at multiple levels; employing a multi-agent collaboration strategy for joint optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Achieves quality closest to expert-designed ground truth.

Conclusion: Delivers superior information preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种求解旅行商问题(TSP)的变分算法，该算法结合了紧凑的置换编码和优化-冻结-重用策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决旅行商问题，并减少量子比特的需求。

Method: 该算法首先通过模拟退火(SA)在训练实例上优化电路拓扑结构，然后“冻结”并在新的实例上重复使用，仅限于快速重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机生成的对称实例上，该算法在4个城市的情况下实现了100%的平均最优旅行采样概率，5个城市的情况下为90%，6个城市的情况下为80%。7个城市时，成功率显著下降到~20%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，该方法对中等问题规模具有较强的泛化能力，并且冻结Ansatz可以显著减少求解时间，且不降低解的质量。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在时间序列分析中，如何利用专家提供的概要因果图（SCG）来发现变量间的因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间序列分析中，理解时间变量之间的因果关系至关重要，尤其是在完整的因果结构未知的情况下。专家通常可以提供一个高层次的因果图抽象，即概要因果图，以捕捉不同时间序列之间的主要因果关系。

Method: 本文提出了一些条件，在这些条件下，给定SCG中编码的背景知识，并且假设可以访问真实未知图的忠实和因果充分分布，可以保证时间变量之间微观层面边缘的可定向性。

Result: 本文的结果为微观层面的边缘定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边缘的情况下也是如此。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用SCG来指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用的指导，并强调了结合专家知识以改进从观察时间序列数据中进行因果推断的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为树引导扩散规划器 (TDP) 的零样本测试时间规划框架，该框架通过结构化轨迹生成来平衡探索和利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的梯度引导通常在凸和可微的奖励情况下表现最佳，但在涉及非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构的实际场景中，效果会大大降低。此外，最近的监督规划方法需要特定于任务的训练或价值估计器，这限制了测试时间的灵活性和零样本泛化。

Method: 将测试时间规划构建为树搜索问题，使用双层抽样过程：(1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成不同的父轨迹，以鼓励广泛探索，以及 (2) 通过由任务目标引导的快速条件去噪来细化子轨迹。

Result: 在迷宫寻金、机器人手臂积木操作和 AntMaze 多目标探索这三个不同的任务上评估了 TDP。TDP 在所有任务上始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TDP 通过探索不同的轨迹区域并仅使用预训练模型和测试时间奖励信号来利用此扩展解空间中的梯度信息，从而解决了梯度引导的局限性。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) that mimics a clinical consultation team to improve the interpretation of clinical narratives, specifically focusing on identifying clinical problems from SOAP notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but single-model LLM approaches lack the robustness needed for high-stakes clinical tasks.

Method: A collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) is used, modeling a clinical consultation team. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. The system analyzes the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes.

Result: The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes.

Conclusion: The system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools by modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, although it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

TL;DR: ORCA: An LLM agentic system automates causal inference workflows in relational databases (RDBMS), enabling non-experts to perform complex data analysis with expert oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Executing data analysis workflows in RDBMS by non-experts can lead to bottlenecks, hindering timely business insights.

Method: ORCA orchestrates the full data analysis pipeline: interpreting natural language queries, navigating tables, generating SQL, preprocessing data, and configuring causal modeling.

Result: ORCA achieves over 7x improvement in estimating average treatment effect compared to GPT-4o mini on benchmark and synthetic e-commerce datasets.

Conclusion: ORCA enables robust data-driven decision making with less technical expertise by automating routine workflows in RDBMS while preserving expert oversight through human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making science while the
complexity of the data analysis workflow, ranging from data wrangling to causal
analysis, increases substantially as the scale of data grows in complicated
business environments. Especially, the execution of the workflow in relational
databases by non-experts can result in repetitive bottlenecks which impede
timely and responsible business insights. To address this challenge, we propose
ORCA (Orchestrating Causal Agent), an LLM agentic system that can automate
routine workflows in RDBMS while preserving expert oversight via human-AI
interactions. ORCA orchestrates the full data analysis pipeline: interpreting
natural language queries, navigating tables from DB servers, generating proper
SQL codes, preprocessing data, and configuring modeling processes using causal
inference libraries. Domain experts still can control the automation through
iterative interactions with ORCA, enabling robust data-driven decision making
with less technical expertise in statistical computing. Empirical evaluations
on benchmark and synthetic e-commerce datasets demonstrate competitive
performance of ORCA in table understanding, query generation, and cause-effect
estimation -- achieving over $7\times$ improvement in estimating average
treatment compared to GPT-4o mini.

Result: Hilbert forest 在 Task 1 中表现出竞争性能，并在 Task 2 中实现了最快的构建时间，同时满足了所需的召回率水平。

Conclusion: Hilbert forest 索引技术在内存限制严格的情况下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We report our participation in the SISAP 2025 Indexing Challenge using a
novel indexing technique called the Hilbert forest. The method is based on the
fast Hilbert sort algorithm, which efficiently orders high-dimensional points
along a Hilbert space-filling curve, and constructs multiple Hilbert trees to
support approximate nearest neighbor search. We submitted implementations to
both Task 1 (approximate search on the PUBMED23 dataset) and Task 2 (k-nearest
neighbor graph construction on the GOOAQ dataset) under the official resource
constraints of 16 GB RAM and 8 CPU cores. The Hilbert forest demonstrated
competitive performance in Task 1 and achieved the fastest construction time in
Task 2 while satisfying the required recall levels. These results highlight the
practical effectiveness of Hilbert order-based indexing under strict memory
limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库规范化对于保持数据完整性至关重要，但手动执行耗时且容易出错。

Method: Miffie采用双模型自精炼架构，结合了用于规范化模式生成和验证的最佳模型。生成模块根据验证模块的反馈消除异常，直到输出模式满足规范化要求。还精心设计了特定于任务的零样本提示，以指导模型实现高精度和成本效益。

Result: 实验结果表明，Miffie可以规范化复杂的数据库模式，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: Miffie能够在无需人工干预的情况下自动进行数据库规范化，并保持高准确率。

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: 强调将框架视为实验设计的主动组成部分的重要性，并呼吁在推荐系统研究中使用更透明、可重现的工具。为研究人员和开发人员提供了可行的建议，以减轻隐藏的配置行为并提高超参数调整工作流程的透明度。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of
recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or
secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to
auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We
show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented
early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian
Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to
users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and
quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings
reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the
differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance
of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for
more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems
research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers
to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of
hyperparameter tuning workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统难以准确地为交互历史有限的新用户提供建议，即冷启动用户问题。

Method: 利用Double和Dueling深度Q网络(DQN)，动态学习用户偏好。

Result: 在大型电子商务数据集上，该方法优于传统的基于流行度的推荐方法和主动学习策略，尤其Dueling DQN能有效降低冷启动用户的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私受限环境下的冷启动用户推荐提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

TL;DR: CDCDA-PLM: A framework for personalized on-device language models using cloud-based LLMs for data augmentation and PEFT fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack personalization and rely on cloud infrastructure, hindering adoption.

Method: Proposes CDCDA-PLM, which uses a cloud LLM to augment user data and fine-tunes a personalized on-device LM via PEFT.

Result: Experimental results on six personalization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

Conclusion: CDCDA-PLM addresses the limitations of existing LLMs by enabling personalized on-device language models with high response speeds and no network dependency.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress
has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However,
existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader
adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization
tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure
due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network
dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on
either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device
deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both
limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language
models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying
personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a
powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side
LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal
data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic
data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local
devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based
LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high
response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used
personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推荐系统中群体公平和个体公平之间的关系，发现两者之间可能存在冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对群体公平和个体公平关系缺乏科学认知，因为之前的研究使用了不同的评估方法，无法进行适当的比较。因此，目前尚不清楚提高一种公平性会如何影响另一种公平性。

Method: 通过综合比较可用于两种公平性类型的评估指标来研究群体和个体公平性之间的关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，对群体高度公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平。

Conclusion: 研究结果对于旨在提高系统公平性的RS从业者具有新颖性和实用性。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing
foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for
advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study,
we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to
assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource,
multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of
19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains --
including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media -- we identify key
characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest
that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset
transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation
scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly
enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been
publicly released to facilitate future research.

### [126] [Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460)
*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diff-MSIN, a diffusion-based multi-modal synergy interest network, to improve click-through rate (CTR) prediction by addressing the limitations of existing methods in modeling multi-modal user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTR prediction methods based on ID modality fail to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Directly applying existing multi-modal fusion methods is not effective because they fail to disentangle commonalities and specificities across modalities and consider synergistic effects.

Method: The paper proposes Diff-MSIN, which includes three modules: Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE), Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC), and Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF). It also incorporates a Knowledge Decoupling method to encourage distinctiveness among features.

Result: Experiments on Rec-Tmall and Amazon datasets show that Diff-MSIN improves performance by at least 1.67% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Diff-MSIN framework enhances multi-modal recommendation systems by effectively modeling user preferences and improving the quality of feature fusion.

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分利用从数字历史地图中提取的矢量化特征，需要以结构化和有意义的方式组织这些特征，以支持高效的访问和使用。问答（QA）是一种有前景的方法，它允许用户以自然和直观的方式检索知识。

Method: 通过将从历史地图数据构建的时空知识图谱（KG）与大型语言模型（LLM）集成，开发了一个GeoQA系统。定义了本体以指导时空KG的构建，并研究了两种不同类型的GeoQA的工作流程：事实型和描述型。额外的的数据源，如历史地图图像和互联网搜索结果，被整合到框架中，为描述性GeoQA提供额外的上下文。

Result: 评估结果表明，该系统可以生成具有高交付率和高语义准确性的答案。

Conclusion: 该系统可以通过交互式查询和可视化来访问。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from
digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the
extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that
supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering
(QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query
languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this
project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge
graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of
the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of
GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map
images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to
provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate
that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high
semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web
application that supports interactive querying and visualization.

Abstract: Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become
increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary
analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce
redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices. Code

*Philipp Hager,Onno Zoeter,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 两塔模型在工业界处理有偏差的用户反馈中很受欢迎，但最近的研究表明，在表现良好的生产系统上训练两塔模型会导致排序性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文研究了这种现象的两种解释：来自日志策略的混淆效应和模型的可识别性问题。

Method: 本文从理论上分析了两塔模型的可识别性条件，表明跨位置的文档交换或重叠的特征分布是使模型参数从点击中恢复所必需的。本文还研究了日志策略对两塔模型的影响，发现当模型完美地捕捉用户行为时，它们不会引入偏差。然而，当模型不能完美地捕捉用户行为时，日志策略会放大偏差，特别是当预测误差与跨位置的文档放置相关时。

Result: 本文提出了一种样本加权技术来减轻这些影响。

Conclusion: 本文为使用两塔模型的研究人员和从业人员提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的主题聚焦的局部可检索性度量方法（T-Retrievability），用于更准确地评估检索模型的曝光偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可检索性分数可能无法准确反映曝光偏差，而是指示主题相关性的变化。

Method: 首先计算多个主题相关文档组的可检索性分数，然后聚合这些局部值以获得集合级别的统计信息。

Result: 使用 T-Retrievability 的分析揭示了神经排序模型曝光特征的新见解。

Conclusion: 局部测量提供了对曝光公平性更细致的理解，为评估 IR 系统中的文档可访问性提供了一种更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures
its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank
cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across
documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability
scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in
our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the
exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution
of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately
reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a
solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we
call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes
retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and
then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level
statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers
new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking
models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more
nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach
for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.

*Zhuoxing Wei,Qingchen Xie,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为深度多模态群组兴趣网络 (DMGIN) 的模型，以提高点击率 (CTR) 预测，通过利用多模态LLM对用户点击后行为序列进行分组，并使用组内和组间transformer来捕获用户群组兴趣的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于终身用户行为序列建模用户兴趣对于提高点击率 (CTR) 预测至关重要。然而，长的点击后行为序列本身会带来严重的性能问题，并且将多模态嵌入集成到现有的大型推荐模型 (LRM) 中存在重大挑战。

Method: DMGIN 采用多模态 LLM (MLLM) 进行分组，以更有效地重组完整的终身点击后行为序列，与直接引入多模态嵌入相比，几乎没有额外的计算开销。在每个组内，使用兴趣统计和组内transformer来捕获组特征。应用组间transformer来捕获用户群组兴趣的演变。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上的大量实验证实了 DMGIN 的有效性和效率。在 LBS 广告系统中的 A/B 测试表明，DMGIN 将 CTR 提高了 4.7%，每英里收入提高了 2.3%。

Conclusion: DMGIN 模型能够有效地提高 CTR 预测的准确性和效率，并在实际应用中取得了显著的收益。

Abstract: Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial
for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click
behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume
of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training
and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage
approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete
utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating
multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents
significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens
and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the
model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest
Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences
contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,
DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete
lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no
additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing
multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from
grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors
within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers
to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally
ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that
DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.

Conclusion: 由此产生的工作流程减少了手动审查的需要。当只需要调查一部分人口时，例如在制裁调查中，该方法可以更好地控制遗漏实体变体的风险。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Conclusion: 本文 критически 分析了 RL 的伦理、部署和奖励设计挑战，并总结了安全、以人为本的策略学习经验。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在二元效价预测或特定于受试者的分类，这限制了在现实世界情感计算系统中的通用性和部署。

Method: 该方法采用结构化的预处理策略，包括时间窗口分割、混合统计和频域特征提取以及z-score归一化，以将原始脑电信号转换为鲁棒的、有区分性的输入向量。情感标签在三个互补轴上导出和编码：(i)基于正负情感评级的平均极性的二元效价分类，以及(ii)多类情感分类，其中预测最有效状态的存在。(iii)通过将每种情绪分箱成10个有序类别的细粒度多标签表示。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型始终优于其他模型，在二元效价任务中达到0.932的F1分数，在多类和多标签情绪分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的统一、多粒度脑电情绪分类框架在情绪识别方面表现出色，为未来情感计算系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

TL;DR: PVPO是一种高效的强化学习方法，它通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样来增强性能，在多个任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无评论家强化学习方法依赖于策略内的多次采样和比较来估计优势，这可能导致策略陷入局部最优并增加计算成本。

Method: 该方法使用参考模型提前进行rollout，并使用计算出的奖励分数作为参考锚点，以校正组内比较引入的累积偏差，并减少对rollout数量的依赖。此外，参考模型可以在数据预采样期间评估样本难度，从而有效选择高收益数据以提高训练效率。

Result: 在两个领域的九个数据集上进行的实验表明，PVPO实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PVPO方法不仅展示了跨多个任务的鲁棒泛化能力，而且展示了跨不同规模模型的Scalable性能。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: AdaGram: An optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix adaptive gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive gradient methods' use of diagonal preconditioning matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations.

Method: Utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update direction at each iteration, and maintain the low-rank structure of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator methods.

Result: AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations.

Conclusion: AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive optimization in large models.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了支持智能 HVAC 系统中的模型预测控制，需要准确预测未来 48 小时的温度、太阳辐射和相对湿度。

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了推荐系统中最小化隐式反馈推理数据的可行性，发现技术上可行，但实际应用受技术设置和用户特征影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统依赖大量个人数据，但数据最小化原则要求限制个人数据处理到必要范围，这构成挑战。本研究旨在将这一原则应用于推荐系统。

Method: 提出新的问题公式，分析各种最小化技术，并调查影响其有效性的关键因素。

Result: 证明在没有显著性能损失的情况下，大幅减少推理数据在技术上是可行的。

Conclusion: 数据最小化在技术上可行，但其实际应用具有挑战性，且对技术和用户环境的依赖使得难以实施通用的数据“必要性”标准。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

*Evan J. Chou,Lisa S. Locke,Harvey M. Soldan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI system for anomaly detection in NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The DSN's equipment degrades over time, potentially disrupting data flow and threatening spacecraft connections.

Method: The study uses machine learning for data reconstruction and anomaly detection, reinforcement learning for severity classification, and a large language model for explanation. A data pipeline system was implemented for DSN transmitters.

Result: A full data pipeline system connects data extraction, parsing, and processing for DSN transmitters. Models trained from DSN antenna data are connected, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. An agentic AI system integrates these components for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The AI system assists in pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation, improving DSN maintenance and operations.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

### [140] [Adaptive LLM Routing under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21141)
*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM路由方法，该方法将LLM路由视为上下文bandit问题，并使用bandit反馈进行自适应决策，而不需要所有查询-LLM对的详尽推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中，大型语言模型（LLM）的能力和成本各不相同，并且缺乏最佳查询-LLM配对的全面知识。

Method: 开发了一个查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，该空间最初从离线人工偏好数据中学习，并通过在线bandit反馈进行改进。通过Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive RouTing (PILOT)实例化这个想法，这是LinUCB的一个新扩展。为了处理模型路由的不同用户预算，引入了一个在线成本策略，该策略被建模为一个多选择背包问题，以确保资源高效的路由。

Result: 提出了PILOT方法。

Conclusion: 研究了LLM路由作为一个上下文bandit问题，并提出了PILOT方法，以解决实际应用中LLM路由的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据的隐私泄露审计问题，提出了一种新的成员推理攻击方法Gen-LRA，该方法通过评估测试样本在替代模型估计局部似然比时的影响来进行攻击，无需模型知识或访问权限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的合成数据隐私审计框架依赖于启发式方法和不合理的假设，无法充分描述和检测训练数据通过合成数据发布而暴露的隐私风险。

Method: 提出Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA)，一种新颖且计算高效的No-Box MIA，通过评估测试样本在替代模型估计局部似然比时的影响来进行攻击。

Result: 在包含各种数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的综合基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上始终优于其他生成模型的MIA。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA可以作为合成数据发布的隐私审计工具，强调了生成模型过拟合在实际应用中带来的重大隐私风险。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的DeepResESN能够显著提升记忆容量和长期时间建模能力，并在时间序列任务中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Conclusion: FUTURE 是一种用于树集成模型的新型不可学习算法，它通过将遗忘样本的问题转化为基于梯度的优化任务，并采用概率模型近似来解决树集成模型的不可微性问题，从而实现高效的端到端不可学习。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文将大型语言模型中的解码过程描述为在概率单纯形上的约束变分原理，其中离散上升是经典的多重权重更新，其连续时间极限是复制器流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型中，解码通常被描述为对token进行评分并使用softmax进行归一化。本文旨在对此步骤给出一个最小的、独立的解释。

Method: 使用约束变分原理、多重权重更新和复制器流等数学工具。

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，下一个token的分布在单纯形内遵循平滑轨迹并收敛到softmax平衡。温度作为沿同一轨迹的时间的精确重新缩放，而top-k和nucleus采样将流限制为具有相同保证的面。

Conclusion: 本文形式化了输出分布层面的“流形遍历”直觉，并对路径依赖的得分调整及其与循环式幻觉行为的联系进行了受控的描述。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了强化学习（RL）在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的应用，发现了一些反直觉的现象，例如单样本训练可以达到整个数据集的性能，不准确的奖励信号也有效，甚至只用负样本训练也能超越复杂的基于奖励的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究这些反直觉现象出现的条件，以及它们何时失效。

Result: 发现模型-任务对齐是关键因素，当模型和任务已经表现出很强的对齐时，这些反直觉的结果才会出现。标准RL训练在各种设置中仍然有效。

Conclusion: 这些反直觉技术在更具挑战性的环境中失效，而标准RL方法仍然有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Motivation: 为了解决持续学习中灾难性遗忘的问题，并提高内存效率，无需存储原始数据样本或任务标签。

Method: 该方法利用 SOM 在 VAE 学习的潜在空间（对于高维输入）或独立地（对于低维输入）运行，并存储每个 SOM 单元的运行均值、方差和协方差，从中生成合成样本用于未来的学习迭代。对于基于 VAE 的方法，生成的样本通过解码器馈送，然后在后续回放中使用。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种可扩展、无任务标签且内存高效的持续学习解决方案，并且易于可视化学习过程，也可在训练后用作生成模型。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的元学习框架，该框架利用架构多样性，使用专家混合 (MoE) 模型动态组合来自三种异构的最先进代理模型的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真 CFD 仿真的计算成本仍然是汽车设计和优化周期中的一个重要瓶颈。虽然基于 ML 的代理模型已成为加速空气动力学预测的一种有前途的替代方案，但该领域的特点是专业神经网络架构的多样化和快速发展的格局，没有一个模型表现出普遍的优势。

Method: 我们提出了一个专家混合 (MoE) 模型，该模型采用专用门控网络来动态且最佳地组合来自三种异构的最先进代理模型的预测：DoMINO、可分解多尺度神经算子；X-MeshGraphNet，一种可扩展的多尺度图神经网络；和 FigConvNet，一种分解的隐式全局卷积网络。

Conclusion: 这项工作将 MoE 框架确立为一种强大而有效的策略，通过协同结合专业架构的互补优势来创建更强大、更准确的复合代理模型。

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Relevance Patching (RelP) 的方法，它是一种用于定位模型中负责特定行为的组件的技术，并且比现有的激活修补方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补在机械可解释性中是一种标准方法，但计算成本高。Attribution patching速度更快，但深度非线性网络中存在噪声和可靠性降低的问题。

Method: RelP用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) 的传播系数替换了attribution patching中的局部梯度。LRP将网络输出向后传播，根据局部传播规则重新分配相关性。

Result: RelP在各种模型和任务中都比标准attribution patching更准确地近似激活修补，尤其是在分析Indirect Object Identification (IOI) 任务中的残差流和MLP输出时。例如，在GPT-2 Large中，attribution patching的Pearson相关系数为0.006，而RelP达到0.956。

Conclusion: RelP在计算效率和准确性之间取得了平衡，为识别稀疏特征电路提供了一种有价值的工具。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

*Hossein KhademSohi,Hadi Hemmati,Jiayu Zhou,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedOwen的联邦学习框架，用于更准确地估计客户端的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计每个客户端的贡献对于公平奖励和选择最有用的客户端至关重要，从而加快全局模型的收敛速度。

Method: 使用Owen抽样来近似计算Shapley值，并采用自适应客户端选择策略。

Result: 在非独立同分布（non-IID）基准测试中，与最先进的基线方法相比，FedOwen在相同数量的通信轮次内实现了高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen能够以较低的近似误差，在固定的评估成本下，实现更高的最终准确率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

### [150] [Guess-and-Learn (G&L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270)
*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0 评估了机器学习模型的冷启动适应性，通过测量模型在顺序标注未标记数据集时产生的总错误来弥补传统评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型评估侧重于最终准确率，忽略了适应成本，即从头开始学习时产生的累积误差。G&L旨在解决这个问题。

Method: G&L 定义了四个track（Scratch/Pretrained x Online/Batch）来分离初始化和更新频率的影响。该方法形式化了协议，将其与经典错误绑定理论相关联，并为 MNIST 估计了一个启发式“oracle reference band”作为合理性参考。

Result: 在 MNIST 和 AG News 上的基线实验表明，早期阶段效率存在系统性差异：较小的模型可以用较少的初始错误进行调整，而预训练的好处因领域而异。在所有设置中，当前模型仍然远高于 oracle band，突出了适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L 通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准，并为开发不仅在极限情况下准确，而且从第一个例子开始就可靠的学习器提供了一个可重复的框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

### [151] [CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273)
*Ashok Devireddy,Shunping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM是一个用于实时异常检测的框架，可以适应数据模式的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在面对概念漂移时性能下降。本文旨在解决动态流环境中的高性能异常检测问题。

Method: 该论文介绍了一个名为CALM的框架，它利用TimesFm基础模型进行预测异常检测，并引入闭环连续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件。

Result: CALM在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调的模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC评分。

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应的LLM引导方法，可以有效维持动态流环境中的高性能异常检测。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

*Yibin Sun,Nick Lim,Guilherme Weigert Cassales,Heitor Murilo Gomes,Bernhard Pfahringer,Albert Bifet,Anany Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用数据流学习技术检测肌电激活中的域漂移，重点关注 Ninapro 数据库中的 DB6 数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于肌电信号的固有非平稳性，检测肌电激活中的域漂移构成了一项重大挑战。

Method: 使用带有余弦核的核主成分分析 (KPCA) 预处理和突出这些漂移。通过评估多种漂移检测方法（例如 CUSUM、Page-Hinckley 和 ADWIN）。

Result: 揭示了当前技术在实现 EMG 信号实时域漂移检测的高性能方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 强调了基于流的方法在维持稳定的 EMG 解码模型方面的潜力，同时突出了进一步研究以增强现实场景中的鲁棒性和准确性的领域。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

### [153] [MyGO: Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation for Lifelong Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21296)
*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MyGO的终身学习框架，该框架通过生成模型和知识提炼来解决灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储原始数据，从而在隐私和存储效率方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的终身学习方法依赖于存储先前任务的样本或使用复杂的正则化项来保护学习到的权重，但这些方法在数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异性方面面临挑战。

Method: 该方法包括“唤醒”和“睡眠”两个阶段。在“唤醒”阶段，系统快速学习新任务并训练一个紧凑的生成模型（Generative Memory，G-mem）以捕获其数据分布。在“睡眠”阶段，系统进入离线状态，使用所有学习到的G-mem模型来生成伪数据（“梦想”），并通过知识提炼将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉（Split-MNIST）和自然语言处理（Split-AG News）基准测试中，MyGO显著减轻了灾难性遗忘，并在各项任务中保持了较高的平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效且具有领域通用性。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

### [154] [Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)
*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为VILA的新型机器学习遗忘框架，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLM）中存在的敏感信息泄露问题。与现有方法FILA相比，VILA在参数效率和训练速度上都有显著提升，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解决LLM敏感信息泄露问题的方法（如重训练）成本过高；FILA等机器学习遗忘方法虽然有潜力，但在参数效率和准确性方面仍有局限。

Method: 论文提出了VILA框架，该框架显式地考虑了FILA忽略的基本假设，从而提高了遗忘集参数识别的准确性。VILA无需访问整个模型即可实现参数识别，从而显著降低了计算成本。

Result: VILA方法在参数效率上比FILA高出100倍，训练速度快40倍，并在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE等基准测试中取得了新的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: VILA是一种高效且准确的机器学习遗忘框架，能够有效解决LLM中的敏感信息泄露问题，并在参数效率和训练速度上优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

### [155] [Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314)
*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架，用于理解实践中常用的 Q-learning 强化学习算法的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究此类算法的两个显着特征：(i) Q 表使用智能体状态（例如循环神经网络的状态）递归更新，该状态不是置信状态或信息状态；(ii) 策略正则化通常用于鼓励探索和稳定学习算法。

Method: 我们研究了此类 Q-learning 算法的最简单形式，我们称之为正则化智能体状态 Q-learning (RASQL)，并表明它在温和的技术条件下收敛到适当定义的正则化 MDP 的不动点，这取决于行为策略引起的平稳分布。

Result: 我们还表明，类似的分析继续适用于学习周期性策略的 RASQL 变体。我们提供了数值例子来说明经验收敛行为与所提出的理论极限相匹配。

Conclusion: RASQL 算法在温和的技术条件下收敛到正则化 MDP 的不动点。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [156] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE introduces a tunable approach to selecting features in sparse autoencoders, balancing global consistency and fine-grained reconstruction by sampling from a candidate pool of features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TopK SAEs are inefficient because they don't account for varying information content across tokens. BatchTopK improves average reconstruction but can suffer from an 'activation lottery' where rare features dominate.

Method: Sampled-SAE scores features in a batch activation matrix and samples a candidate pool before applying Top-K selection. The size of the candidate pool is controlled by the parameter 'l', which balances global and token-specific feature selection.

Result: No single value of 'l' optimizes all metrics; the best choice depends on the desired trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance on Pythia-160M.

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE reframes BatchTopK as a tunable, distribution-aware family of methods.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的用于长期时间序列的分阶段生成模型 Stage-Diff。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列生成任务具有长期依赖性和数据分布漂移的挑战，同时序列内部和序列之间的复杂关系也增加了建模难度。

Method: 模型通过分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递来保持长期序列依赖性，并通过在每个阶段内应用渐进式序列分解来执行通道独立的建模，同时利用多通道融合建模进行阶段间信息传递。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的大量实验验证了 Stage-Diff 在长期时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff 有效地平衡了长期时间序列的序列内和序列间依赖性。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时间序列合成方法DLGAN，它通过双层生成对抗网络，在保证时间依赖性的同时，准确捕捉原始时间序列的特征信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间序列合成方法难以保证生成序列中的时间依赖性，并且直接在随机序列上建模时间特征难以准确捕捉原始时间序列的特征信息。

Method: 该模型将时间序列生成过程分解为序列特征提取和序列重构两个阶段。首先，这两个阶段形成一个完整的自编码器，对原始时间序列进行监督学习，以确保重构过程可以恢复序列的时间依赖性。其次，使用生成对抗网络(GAN)生成与实时序列特征向量对齐的合成特征向量，确保生成器可以从真实时间序列中捕获时间特征。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在各种评估指标上都具有优越性。

Conclusion: DLGAN模型在时间序列合成方面表现出色，能够有效保证生成序列的时间依赖性并准确捕捉原始时间序列的特征信息。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化算法AHTSGD，它通过在训练初期注入重尾噪声来增强探索，并随着曲率稳定逐渐过渡到轻尾噪声，从而加速收敛到宽盆地。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化算法过度依赖训练损失，泛化能力不足。宽盆地被认为可以提高泛化能力，而梯度噪声的重尾分布和神经⽹络训练过程中的Edge of Stability现象为本⽂提供了动机。

Method: 提出AHTSGD算法，该算法根据Edge of Stability现象动态调整注入优化器的噪声类型。

Result: AHTSGD在MNIST和CIFAR-10等基准测试中优于SGD和其他基于噪声的⽅法，在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: AHTSGD算法可以加速从不良初始化开始的早期训练，并在干净和噪声环境中改善泛化，同时对学习率选择保持稳健。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Motivation: 研究神经网络是否通过平滑、渐进的改进来构建它们的表征，还是通过更复杂的计算过程？

Method: 通过扩展logit lens来分析Leela Chess Zero的策略网络。

Result: 在层与层之间，Leela Chess Zero在棋力强度和解谜能力方面表现出强大的单调趋势，但策略分布经常遵循非平滑轨迹。证据包括：早期发现但随后被丢弃的正确谜题解决方案，与最终输出相关性较差的移动排名，以及直到网络后期才出现的高策略差异。

Conclusion: 这些发现与语言模型中通常观察到的平滑分布收敛形成对比。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general and modular framework for mixture modeling.

Method: Data partitioning and fitting separate estimators to each subset.

Result: Near-optimal rates for estimator class; Valid even with different distribution families; MV-PMODE scales to thousands of dimensions; Competitive performance on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection against deep baselines.

Conclusion: PMODE is a simple but effective approach to high-dimensional density estimation.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Motivation: 当前通信和移动网络缺乏有效的监测手段，而本文旨在利用现成的数据集和储备池计算框架，提供一种低成本、通用的监测方法。

Method: 该方法将网络数据转换为储备池计算框架内的模型，并通过测量模型在代理任务上的性能来评估网络状态。具体来说，使用匿名、聚合的移动网络利用率数据，将其视为加权网络，并利用回声状态网络（ESN）进行处理。ESN将输入信号投影到更高维空间，并在该空间上操作单个训练层。

Result: 实验表明，代理任务的性能与网络状态相关，并且展示了性能如何依赖于特定的网络配置，以及在扰动网络时性能如何明显下降。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法可以用于近实时监测，并识别移动通信网络和交通网络的潜在薄弱点。

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）集成的连续生物制造中无监督异常检测的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续生物制造过程中的异常检测至关重要，因为即使是微小的偏差也会影响产量和稳定性，导致调度中断、每周产量减少和经济效益下降。这些过程本质上是复杂的，并且表现出非线性动态，过程变量之间存在复杂的关系，因此先进的异常检测方法对于高效运行至关重要。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于生成对抗网络（GAN）集成的连续生物制造中无监督异常检测的新框架。我们首先建立了一个基准数据集，模拟小分子生产连续过程中的正常和异常运行状态。然后，我们证明了我们基于 GAN 的框架在检测由突然的原料变化引起的异常方面的有效性。最后，我们评估了使用混合量子/经典 GAN 方法（包括模拟量子电路和真实光子量子处理器）对异常检测性能的影响。

Result: 我们发现混合方法提高了异常检测率。

Conclusion: 我们的工作展示了混合量子/经典方法在解决复杂连续生物制造过程中的实际问题的潜力。

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的RL算法，该算法结合了标准集成平均和时间平均增长率，以优化个体轨迹的长期性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习算法优化的是预期累积奖励，但这种集成平均可能无法反映个体轨迹的性能。在许多应用中，优化个体轨迹的长期性能可能更理想。

Method: 定义了时间平均增长率的贝尔曼算子，并提出了一种改进的几何平均数，带有N滑动窗口，以捕获路径依赖性，作为时间平均增长率的估计器，并将其嵌入到目标函数中作为正则化项。

Result: 在具有挑战性的模拟中，该算法优于传统的RL方法。

Conclusion: 该算法能够同时受益于集成平均和时间平均。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Conclusion: 本文提出的 Rm-NML 在坐标变换下是不变的，并且与欧几里德空间中的传统 NML 一致。此外，还推导了一种简化黎曼对称空间上 Rm-NML 计算的方法。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: CByG框架对于实际药物发现应用有效且实用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Motivation: 量化强化学习中的不确定性可以显著提高探索和鲁棒性。近似贝叶斯方法在量化无模型算法中的不确定性方面越来越受欢迎。然而，到目前为止，重点一直是提高后验近似的准确性，而不是研究后验的先验和似然假设的准确性。

Conclusion: 作者认为，应该更加注重开发更合适的似然函数和先验，并为深度Q学习中更好的先验提供了简单的、可实现的解决方案，从而产生更有效的贝叶斯算法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越多地被用于高风险决策任务中，例如贷款审批，但是大语言模型在处理表格数据、确保公平性和提供可靠的预测方面存在困难。

Method: 在来自三个不同地理区域（加纳、德国和美国）的序列化贷款审批数据集上评估了LLM的zero-shot和in-context learning (ICL)能力。

Result: 序列化格式的选择显著影响LLM的性能和公平性，某些格式（如GReat和LIFT）产生更高的F1分数，但加剧了公平性差距。ICL相对于zero-shot基线提高了模型性能4.9-59.6%，但其对公平性的影响因数据集而异。

Conclusion: 强调了有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型对于提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Motivation: 现有的提前退出方法依赖于基于置信度的退出策略，并且需要校准中间分类器以提高整个模型的性能。

Method: 本文提出使用失败预测作为早期退出模型性能的代理。

Result: 实验表明，在某些情况下，未校准的网络优于校准的网络。失败预测可以解释样本排名的变化，并且与效率的提高密切相关。

Conclusion: 失败预测是设计和评估早期退出模型更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

TL;DR: 提出了Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT)，将脉冲神经元嵌入到自注意力模块中，并通过代理梯度进行端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer架构的强化学习智能体在序列决策任务上表现出色，但它们对密集矩阵运算的依赖使得它们不适合能量受限的边缘平台。脉冲神经网络具有超低功耗、事件驱动的推理能力，但以往的工作尚未将脉冲动力学与回报条件序列建模无缝结合。

Method: 将Leaky Integrate-and-Fire神经元嵌入到每个自注意力模块中，通过代理梯度进行端到端训练，并结合了生物启发的的三因素可塑性、相移的基于spike的位置编码和一个轻量级的树突路由模块。

Result: 在经典控制基准测试中，SNN-DT的性能与标准决策Transformer相匹配或超过，同时每次决策发出的spike少于10个，这表明每次推理的能量减少了四个数量级以上。

Conclusion: 通过将序列建模与神经形态效率相结合，SNN-DT为嵌入式和可穿戴设备上的实时、低功耗控制开辟了一条道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

TL;DR: GNN SAT solvers struggle with hard problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN performance on SAT problems degrades on harder instances, questioning architectural limitations.

Method: Using graph Ricci curvature to explain performance bottlenecks.

Result: Bipartite graphs from k-SAT formulas are negatively curved, decreasing with instance difficulty, causing oversquashing in GNNs.

Conclusion: Curvature indicates problem complexity and predicts performance, linking to solver design and future directions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Result: PINNs demonstrate superior generalization and lower MAE in dynamic grid operations compared to data-driven models.

Conclusion: PINNs are a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven flexibility with first-principles rigor.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Motivation: 海洋盐度在环流、气候和海洋生态系统中起着至关重要的作用，但其测量通常是稀疏、不规则和noisy的。传统方法依赖于线性和平稳性，并受到云覆盖、传感器漂移和低卫星重访率的限制。机器学习模型虽然灵活，但通常在严重稀疏的情况下会失效，并且缺乏在没有专用传感器的情况下纳入物理协变量的原则性方法。

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Conclusion: 本书旨在为概率决策算法的理论分析提供一个易于理解的介绍，假设读者只具备概率论和统计学的基础知识，以及一些关于高斯过程的基本知识。

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种机器学习方法，用于预测社交媒体参与度（评论和点赞）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体参与度预测

Method: 使用 HistGradientBoostingRegressor 训练了一个多目标回归模型。

Result: 点赞的 R^2 = 0.98，评论的 R^2 = 0.41

Conclusion: 情感和时间元数据以及现有的浏览量可以有效地预测未来的参与度。点赞主要受情感和曝光信号驱动，而评论取决于其他因素。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的OOD检测方法，该方法利用分类头的权重矩阵的奇异值分解将模型的激活分解为决定性分量和不重要分量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保深度模型在实际应用中的可靠性，OOD检测方法旨在区分接近训练分布的样本（ID）和那些更远的样本（OOD）。

Method: 该方法利用分类头的权重矩阵的奇异值分解将模型的激活分解为决定性分量和不重要分量。

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中，ActSub达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过将两个发现结合到一个名为ActSub的方法中，我们实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的统计学习框架，用于预测特定事件对社区心理健康的影响，通过改进的LRDD方法，结合动态和静态协变量，提高了预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估本地事件对社区心理健康的影响对于公共卫生政策至关重要。传统的心理健康评分预测无法提供深入的事件影响洞察，而准实验设计如LRDD可以帮助研究人员从观察数据中推导出更可能具有因果关系的影响。

Method: 本文提出了一种将LRDDs从传统预测方法改进为统计学习框架的方法，用于估计未来的不连续性（即特定时间的偏移）和斜率变化（即线性轨迹），该方法考虑了位置的历史评分、动态协变量（其他运行评估）和外生变量（静态表示）。

Result: 将该框架应用于预测美国各县因COVID-19事件引起的焦虑不连续性时，发现随着模型复杂性的提高，任务变得更易实现，最佳结果来自整合外生和动态协变量。该方法相比传统的静态社区表示有显著改进（不连续性的r = +0.46，斜率的r = +0.65）。

Conclusion: 不连续性预测为评估潜在的未来或假设事件对特定社区的特殊影响提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: SLAC开发了一个专门的框架，旨在在现场可编程门阵列（FPGA）上部署实时ML推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实现在高速实验环境中引入了过多的延迟，使其不适合高速实验环境。为了应对这些挑战，SLAC开发了SLAC神经网络库（SNL）。

Method: 将基于Python的神经网络模型转换为与SNL兼容的高级综合代码。

Result: SNL在大多数测试架构中实现了有竞争力的或更优越的延迟，同时在某些情况下还节省了FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL的通用性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的研究人员和学者开辟了新的机遇。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多标签排序 (MLR) 范例 UniMLR，它使用正标签之间的排序将隐式类相关性/显着性值建模为概率分布，而不是将它们视为同等重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签排序 (MLR) 框架仅利用从标签的双向划分为正集和负集推导出的信息，因此，他们没有从正标签之间的排序中受益。

Method: 提出 UniMLR，一种新的 MLR 范例，它使用正标签之间的排序将隐式类相关性/显着性值建模为概率分布。

Result: 统计表明，该方法能够准确地学习正等级顺序的表示，该表示与基本事实一致并且与潜在的显着性值成正比。在真实世界和合成数据集上进行了全面的经验实验，证明了所提出的框架的价值。

Conclusion: 该方法统一了与 MLR 相关的排序和分类任务。通过引入八个以不同的显着性决定因素生成的合成数据集（排序的 MNIST），解决 MLR 数据集中稀缺和注释偏差的挑战，提供了一个丰富且可控的实验环境。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法兼顾设备特定信息和用户特定差异，限制了它们在现实世界中的性能。

Method: 引入随机特征dropout策略来处理源异构性，并采用时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标来管理用户异构性。

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上的评估表明，该模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 所学表示具有强大的区分能力，并且一个下游应用任务证实了该模型的实际价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-Health: A mixture of experts framework for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction, handling varied data modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for clinical prediction struggle with incomplete or varied modality data in real-world healthcare settings.

Method: A mixture of experts framework (MoE-Health) with specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism to select and combine relevant experts based on available data modalities.

Result: MoE-Health outperforms existing methods on in-hospital mortality, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction using the MIMIC-IV dataset.

Conclusion: MoE-Health effectively integrates multimodal information, improving predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous healthcare data, making it suitable for diverse healthcare environments.

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数高效微调技术，QR-LoRA，它使用QR分解从预训练权重矩阵中提取正交基，并将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，从而减少了参数数量并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的规模不断增长，需要开发参数高效的微调技术。LoRA是一种有前途的方法，但其变体SVD-LoRA的初始化过程计算成本高，且奇异向量不易解释。

Method: 使用带列主元的QR分解从预训练权重矩阵中提取正交基，然后将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务上的实验表明，QR-LoRA的性能与完整微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA相匹配或超过，且参数数量减少了1000倍以上。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA是一种高效且有效的微调技术，可以在减少参数数量的同时保持或提高性能。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的合成数据生成方法FLIP，以解决表格数据中的隐私和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GDPR、HIPAA和AI Act等法规对现实世界数据使用的限制，特别是在医疗保健等敏感领域。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的变分自编码器，结合潜在扩散，并通过RDP约束和平衡抽样来保证隐私，利用CKA对齐潜在空间中的神经元激活模式以促进公平性。

Result: FLIP在差分隐私约束下，为任务无关的公平性并在各种下游任务中提供了显著的公平性改进。

Conclusion: FLIP方法在保护隐私的同时，有效提升了合成数据的公平性，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.
